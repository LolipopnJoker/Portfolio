1
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,501
Aah!

2
00:02:52,669 --> 00:02:55,128
Show them the courage
of Allah.

3
00:03:08,347 --> 00:03:11,726
Aah!

4
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,029
He says you stole the bread.

5
00:03:26,113 --> 00:03:27,321
It's a lie.

6
00:03:27,405 --> 00:03:29,615
I caught him stealing ours.

7
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,868
Cut off the infidel's hand.

8
00:03:32,952 --> 00:03:34,160
No. I took the bread.

9
00:03:34,202 --> 00:03:35,955
Wait.
That's not true.

10
00:03:36,038 --> 00:03:37,788
They're not interested
in the truth.

11
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:39,456
But he's lying.

12
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,165
You're too weak, Peter.
You would not live.

13
00:03:41,249 --> 00:03:42,543
As you wish.

14
00:03:42,627 --> 00:03:45,045
Cut the other one's
hand off as well.

15
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:47,714
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Robin.

16
00:03:52,217 --> 00:03:53,135
Oh, God.

17
00:04:00,266 --> 00:04:03,518
No, no, no!

18
00:04:20,615 --> 00:04:22,659
This is English courage.

19
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:36,713
Aah!

20
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:39,880
Aah! Aah!

21
00:04:39,922 --> 00:04:42,675
That's for five years of hell.

22
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:50,557
Behind you!

23
00:04:58,271 --> 00:05:00,732
Come on, Robin,
for God's sake.

24
00:05:00,773 --> 00:05:01,899
Come on!

25
00:05:03,609 --> 00:05:05,235
Wait!
Take us with you!

26
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,617
You cannot save
those people, Christian...

27
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,912
but you can save me.

28
00:05:15,954 --> 00:05:17,287
They're coming, Robin.

29
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,081
Robin, come on.

30
00:05:19,122 --> 00:05:20,915
Christian!

31
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,416
Why should I?

32
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:23,249
For pity's sake.

33
00:05:23,332 --> 00:05:24,918
My sentence is death.

34
00:05:25,002 --> 00:05:26,962
He's a Moor. Don't listen.

35
00:05:27,003 --> 00:05:29,089
I will show you a way out.

36
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,423
Why should we?

37
00:05:30,465 --> 00:05:32,423
If you do not,
we're dead.

38
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,593
No, Robin.
For God's sake.

39
00:05:34,636 --> 00:05:36,428
Robin, they're coming!

40
00:05:42,473 --> 00:05:43,893
I'm sorry.

41
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,812
Come, Christian.
Come.

42
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:54,109
This way.

43
00:06:01,991 --> 00:06:04,158
Thanks. I misjudged you.

44
00:06:04,241 --> 00:06:06,619
You are fast
with a sword, my friend.

45
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,580
Five years I've waited
to smell free air.

46
00:06:08,662 --> 00:06:09,955
It makes a man fast.

47
00:06:11,206 --> 00:06:12,206
Aah!

48
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,207
Peter!

49
00:06:17,796 --> 00:06:18,670
It's mortal.

50
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:20,590
Leave me.

51
00:06:22,756 --> 00:06:25,676
Give this ring
to my sister Marian...

52
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,180
and swear you'll
protect her for me.

53
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,222
His wound
is by the heart.

54
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:31,265
We cannot save him.

55
00:06:31,347 --> 00:06:34,224
Swear it, Robin.

56
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:35,728
I swear it.

57
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:36,728
They're coming.

58
00:06:36,811 --> 00:06:39,188
Tell Marian I died
a free Englishman.

59
00:06:39,272 --> 00:06:41,356
Pe-Peter!

60
00:06:42,358 --> 00:06:43,315
Peter!

61
00:06:43,356 --> 00:06:45,527
For England!

62
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,861
No, no!

63
00:06:48,863 --> 00:06:50,322
Come, my friend.

64
00:06:50,362 --> 00:06:53,325
Make his sacrifice
an act of honor.

65
00:06:53,365 --> 00:06:54,326
Come now.

66
00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:25,768
Why did you cut me
free, Christian?

67
00:07:25,851 --> 00:07:28,269
Whatever blood
is in your veins...

68
00:07:28,352 --> 00:07:31,271
no man deserves
to die in there.

69
00:07:36,859 --> 00:07:38,070
Farewell, friend.

70
00:07:39,154 --> 00:07:41,072
God speed your way.

71
00:07:41,155 --> 00:07:44,076
Our way lies together
with the speed of Allah.

72
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,285
What?

73
00:07:45,368 --> 00:07:47,285
You have saved
my life, Christian.

74
00:07:47,369 --> 00:07:50,664
I will stay with you
until I have saved yours.

75
00:07:50,746 --> 00:07:53,164
Thanks, but I go
to England.

76
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,750
I relieve you
of your obligation.

77
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,794
Only Allah can do that.

78
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:00,379
What if I say no?

79
00:08:00,421 --> 00:08:02,048
You have no choice.

80
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:05,300
I am Azeem Edin
Bashir Al Bakir.

81
00:08:05,383 --> 00:08:07,301
You may call me Azeem.

82
00:08:10,387 --> 00:08:11,887
Robin of Locksley.

83
00:08:26,401 --> 00:08:28,319
Kindest sir...

84
00:08:28,403 --> 00:08:31,322
"tis rumored you fought
in King Richard"s crusade...

85
00:08:31,405 --> 00:08:34,576
with my beloved son Robin.

86
00:08:34,616 --> 00:08:37,077
I fear you have
returned home...

87
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,411
to desperate times...

88
00:08:38,493 --> 00:08:41,955
when dark forces plot
against our absent king.

89
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:45,333
I am anxious for word
of my son.

90
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:48,751
Were you present at
his capture nearJerusalem?

91
00:08:48,793 --> 00:08:50,337
Do you know the name...

92
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,255
of the potentate
who holds him?

93
00:08:52,297 --> 00:08:55,257
Does he still bear me ill will?

94
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:58,135
A little news, please, sir.

95
00:08:58,218 --> 00:09:02,139
I would give all that I own
for his release.

96
00:09:10,811 --> 00:09:13,898
I will see him, I tell you!

97
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,858
Get out of my way!

98
00:09:15,941 --> 00:09:16,859
Stop there!

99
00:09:16,942 --> 00:09:19,110
Help me, my lord!

100
00:09:19,152 --> 00:09:21,279
You should have waited.

101
00:09:21,362 --> 00:09:23,574
I'm sorry you were
disturbed, master.

102
00:09:23,657 --> 00:09:26,533
Duncan, it's all right.
Let him go.

103
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,287
They've taken my Gwen,
my daughter.

104
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,499
Who's taken her?

105
00:09:33,581 --> 00:09:38,001
Men on horses,
in masks.

106
00:09:38,043 --> 00:09:40,127
We tried
to stop them, but...

107
00:09:40,169 --> 00:09:43,173
my son, he's dead.

108
00:09:43,214 --> 00:09:44,298
He's dead.

109
00:09:53,555 --> 00:09:55,183
Master, stay.

110
00:09:55,266 --> 00:09:57,308
There is an evil moon tonight.

111
00:09:57,391 --> 00:09:58,644
Never fear, Duncan.

112
00:09:58,727 --> 00:10:00,187
Good will overcome.

113
00:10:00,228 --> 00:10:01,813
Trust in that.

114
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,700
I'm sorry, my lord.

115
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:19,538
I had no choice.

116
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:28,961
You!

117
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:32,170
Locksley.

118
00:10:32,255 --> 00:10:33,964
The king
shall hear of this!

119
00:10:34,046 --> 00:10:35,382
Join us.

120
00:10:35,465 --> 00:10:37,509
Never.

121
00:10:39,219 --> 00:10:40,761
Join us...

122
00:10:40,844 --> 00:10:42,303
or die.

123
00:10:45,558 --> 00:10:48,685
God and King Richard!

124
00:10:48,726 --> 00:10:50,060
Yaah!

125
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:42,562
Oh, thank you, Lord.

126
00:11:47,734 --> 00:11:49,694
I'm home.

127
00:11:49,777 --> 00:11:51,612
I'm home!

128
00:11:54,362 --> 00:11:56,281
You are strange, Christian.

129
00:11:56,365 --> 00:11:58,951
Yes, but I'm free.

130
00:11:59,035 --> 00:12:01,620
Now I beg you
to free yourself of your vow.

131
00:12:01,702 --> 00:12:02,954
Return with the boat.

132
00:12:03,038 --> 00:12:05,623
I know how it feels
to be so far...

133
00:12:05,706 --> 00:12:07,791
from your home
and family.

134
00:12:07,873 --> 00:12:10,293
Because I love them
so much...

135
00:12:10,376 --> 00:12:12,129
I cannot dishonor them.

136
00:12:14,964 --> 00:12:17,090
I thought
you would say that.

137
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,816
No man controls
my destiny...

138
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:39,316
especially not one
who attacks downwind...

139
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,902
and stinks of garlic.

140
00:12:46,323 --> 00:12:47,657
Come, Azeem.

141
00:12:50,367 --> 00:12:52,327
Our fighting days are done.

142
00:12:52,369 --> 00:12:55,832
By nightfall, we'll celebrate
with my father.

143
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:03,128
You understand,
of course...

144
00:13:03,169 --> 00:13:04,838
I had to try.

145
00:13:04,922 --> 00:13:06,382
I would have succeeded.

146
00:13:13,386 --> 00:13:15,471
Why must you walk
in back of me?

147
00:13:15,556 --> 00:13:18,515
In your country,
am I not the infidel?

148
00:13:18,558 --> 00:13:20,017
Ha ha ha.

149
00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:22,352
It seems safer
to appear as your slave...

150
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:23,854
rather than your equal.

151
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:26,857
For an infidel, you have
uncommon clarity of thinking...

152
00:13:26,941 --> 00:13:28,981
but you tell me
nothing of yourself.

153
00:13:29,065 --> 00:13:30,859
For instance,
your name Azeem...

154
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,362
what does it mean?

155
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:33,361
Great one.

156
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:34,863
Great one, really?

157
00:13:34,945 --> 00:13:38,197
Did you give yourself
this name?

158
00:13:38,282 --> 00:13:40,700
It's... It's a joke.

159
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,123
Azeem the great one,
I am home!

160
00:13:47,206 --> 00:13:50,625
Whoo!

161
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:53,002
Look.

162
00:13:54,463 --> 00:13:55,796
Mistletoe.

163
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:00,217
Many a maid's lost
her resolve to me...

164
00:14:00,301 --> 00:14:02,218
thanks to this little plant.

165
00:14:03,762 --> 00:14:06,345
In my country,
we talk to our women.

166
00:14:06,432 --> 00:14:09,515
We do not drug them
with plants.

167
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,476
What do you know of women?

168
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:17,065
Where I come from,
Christian...

169
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:19,566
there are women
of such beauty...

170
00:14:19,648 --> 00:14:22,402
that they can possess
a man's mind so...

171
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,487
that he would be willing
to die for them.

172
00:14:26,406 --> 00:14:28,909
Wait. Is that why
you were to be executed?

173
00:14:28,992 --> 00:14:32,159
Because of a woman?

174
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,455
That's it, isn't it?

175
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,706
That's it!

176
00:14:43,043 --> 00:14:44,961
It is close to sunset.

177
00:14:45,046 --> 00:14:47,965
You painted old dog.
Who was she?

178
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:50,508
The mullah's daughter?

179
00:14:50,592 --> 00:14:52,594
Huh?

180
00:14:52,676 --> 00:14:54,302
Another man's wife?

181
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:57,764
What's her name?

182
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:02,851
Is there no sun
in this cursed country?

183
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:04,561
Which way is east?

184
00:15:04,645 --> 00:15:06,522
- Her name.
- East!

185
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,899
Her name.

186
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:17,114
- Jasmina.
- That way.

187
00:15:17,155 --> 00:15:19,200
You are sure?

188
00:15:19,283 --> 00:15:22,410
I would know blindfolded.
I'm five miles from home.

189
00:15:27,456 --> 00:15:29,040
Was she worth it?

190
00:15:31,752 --> 00:15:34,169
Worth dying for.

191
00:15:39,966 --> 00:15:41,384
We've got him now!

192
00:16:18,164 --> 00:16:19,789
Ha ha ha.

193
00:16:26,379 --> 00:16:28,005
You're dog's meat, son,
you know that.

194
00:16:29,507 --> 00:16:30,883
Get down here!

195
00:16:30,966 --> 00:16:32,677
You know that
you're doomed!

196
00:16:32,761 --> 00:16:34,176
Come down here!

197
00:16:34,258 --> 00:16:35,177
Down!

198
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,845
You're not playing
by the rules, boy.

199
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,766
Deer don't climb trees.

200
00:16:39,848 --> 00:16:42,726
Perhaps he thinks
he's a game bird.

201
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:43,727
Ha ha ha!

202
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,729
Shall we
teach him to fly?

203
00:16:45,811 --> 00:16:46,728
Yeah.

204
00:16:46,811 --> 00:16:48,439
Get him down.

205
00:16:49,773 --> 00:16:50,982
Hold!

206
00:16:52,401 --> 00:16:54,361
I'm curious as to
what manner of creature...

207
00:16:54,403 --> 00:16:57,530
is so fearsome that it
takes six men to attack it.

208
00:16:57,614 --> 00:17:00,530
Stranger, this is
no affair of yours.

209
00:17:00,616 --> 00:17:02,949
Well, have we treed
the devil himself?

210
00:17:03,034 --> 00:17:04,495
Let me see.

211
00:17:04,536 --> 00:17:08,455
A small boy...
a truly dangerous animal.

212
00:17:08,537 --> 00:17:11,499
This boy killed one of
the sheriff of Nottingham's deer.

213
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,043
You starve us!

214
00:17:13,085 --> 00:17:14,961
We needed the meat.

215
00:17:15,044 --> 00:17:17,004
I advise you
to move on, pilgrim.

216
00:17:17,046 --> 00:17:18,504
This is the sheriff s land.

217
00:17:18,545 --> 00:17:19,631
Wrong.

218
00:17:19,713 --> 00:17:22,007
This is my land and my tree.

219
00:17:22,092 --> 00:17:25,968
Therefore, whatever is in it
also belongs to me.

220
00:17:26,052 --> 00:17:28,971
Might I have
the pleasure of your name...

221
00:17:29,056 --> 00:17:31,974
before I have you
run through?

222
00:17:32,058 --> 00:17:35,061
Robin of Locksley.

223
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:41,691
Well, well. Locksley.

224
00:17:43,233 --> 00:17:44,735
Welcome home.

225
00:17:46,277 --> 00:17:47,530
Kill him!

226
00:17:51,574 --> 00:17:52,657
Aah!

227
00:17:52,741 --> 00:17:53,743
Azeem!

228
00:17:53,826 --> 00:17:55,743
It's time
to redeem that vow!

229
00:17:55,827 --> 00:17:57,745
Unleash the hounds!

230
00:18:00,081 --> 00:18:02,374
Get off your damn knees!

231
00:18:06,671 --> 00:18:07,920
Look out!

232
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,469
Yay!

233
00:18:20,762 --> 00:18:22,057
Now, sir...

234
00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:25,561
if you'd be so kind
as to give me your name...

235
00:18:25,644 --> 00:18:27,019
before I run you through.

236
00:18:27,103 --> 00:18:31,023
Guy of Gisborne,
the sheriff s cousin.

237
00:18:32,606 --> 00:18:35,068
That little bastard
was poaching deer.

238
00:18:35,152 --> 00:18:39,278
Poaching? Is it not
a greater crime to starve a family?

239
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:41,906
Go on, Locksley.

240
00:18:43,534 --> 00:18:44,743
Go on.

241
00:18:44,825 --> 00:18:49,621
I've seen enough blood spilt
to last two lifetimes.

242
00:18:49,706 --> 00:18:51,747
Now get off my land.

243
00:18:58,379 --> 00:19:00,797
And tell Nottingham
what happens to his scum...

244
00:19:00,881 --> 00:19:02,800
when they
pick on small children.

245
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,138
You.

246
00:19:08,221 --> 00:19:10,804
You traveled 10,000 miles
to save my life...

247
00:19:10,889 --> 00:19:12,807
then leave me
to be butchered?

248
00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:15,851
I fulfill my vows
when I choose.

249
00:19:15,934 --> 00:19:18,145
Which does not
include prayer times...

250
00:19:18,229 --> 00:19:21,148
or mealtimes or anytime
I'm outnumbered 6-to-1.

251
00:19:21,231 --> 00:19:23,650
You whine like a mule.

252
00:19:23,733 --> 00:19:25,651
You are still alive.

253
00:19:33,241 --> 00:19:35,159
Have no fear.
Come down, boy.

254
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:44,166
Is it true, boy?
Did you kill a deer?

255
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,668
Hundreds of them.

256
00:19:51,088 --> 00:19:52,507
You scared him.

257
00:19:58,596 --> 00:20:00,303
Interesting place, this...

258
00:20:00,389 --> 00:20:02,181
England.

259
00:20:22,782 --> 00:20:24,199
Hold up, Sir Guy.

260
00:20:24,282 --> 00:20:26,201
The sheriff s not
to be disturbed.

261
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:35,376
Cousin.

262
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:38,210
I trust you justify
your intrusion...

263
00:20:38,294 --> 00:20:40,880
with news of profound value.

264
00:20:40,963 --> 00:20:43,505
I met a hooded man today...

265
00:20:43,548 --> 00:20:46,718
who bade me warn you
not to harm his people.

266
00:20:46,801 --> 00:20:49,594
Who told you to cover up?

267
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:50,679
His name?

268
00:20:50,763 --> 00:20:54,224
Robin of Locksley.

269
00:20:54,266 --> 00:20:56,725
The prodigal son returns.

270
00:20:56,766 --> 00:20:59,729
He's a whelp.
This girl could best him.

271
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,688
Put it there!

272
00:21:05,232 --> 00:21:09,028
Yes, well, this whelp
bested four of my men.

273
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:12,196
Yes, well, your men
were probably drunk.

274
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:16,492
And yet you survived, cousin.

275
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,326
I barely survived.

276
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,500
Yes, yes. I'm sure
it would take an army...

277
00:21:27,584 --> 00:21:30,171
to match these rogues.

278
00:21:30,253 --> 00:21:32,047
I trust Locksley's
visited his manor...

279
00:21:32,131 --> 00:21:35,049
and found the home fires
still burning.

280
00:21:37,926 --> 00:21:39,845
Time for potence, cousin.

281
00:21:51,229 --> 00:21:53,397
Mortianna?

282
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,411
Shut up!

283
00:22:22,173 --> 00:22:23,880
You cold, madam?

284
00:22:33,305 --> 00:22:34,766
Chit-chit-chit-chit-choo.

285
00:22:34,808 --> 00:22:36,099
Ya, ya, ya.

286
00:22:55,491 --> 00:22:57,076
What do you see?

287
00:22:59,243 --> 00:23:01,745
The son of a dead man.

288
00:23:01,829 --> 00:23:03,455
Locksley.

289
00:23:03,496 --> 00:23:05,083
Does he affect us?

290
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:07,125
He precedes the lionheart.

291
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:09,668
King Richard returns
from the Crusades.

292
00:23:09,751 --> 00:23:12,170
That could prove
a bit awkward.

293
00:23:12,254 --> 00:23:14,172
It would soften the spines
of the barons.

294
00:23:14,256 --> 00:23:15,173
Soon?

295
00:23:15,257 --> 00:23:16,675
Make haste.

296
00:23:16,757 --> 00:23:19,426
But my plan is still intact?

297
00:23:20,552 --> 00:23:22,554
Aah!

298
00:23:22,638 --> 00:23:23,931
What's wrong?

299
00:23:24,015 --> 00:23:28,642
I have seen our death.

300
00:23:28,727 --> 00:23:30,060
The painted man...

301
00:23:30,145 --> 00:23:31,561
he haunts my dreams...

302
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:35,106
adorned with strange
foreign markings.

303
00:23:35,189 --> 00:23:37,316
Ah! Locksley's companion.

304
00:23:38,358 --> 00:23:40,443
Kill him!

305
00:23:40,528 --> 00:23:42,946
Kill them both!

306
00:23:50,577 --> 00:23:52,287
Father?

307
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,539
Father!

308
00:23:54,582 --> 00:23:56,166
Is anyone here?

309
00:23:58,084 --> 00:23:59,001
Duncan!

310
00:24:00,251 --> 00:24:01,170
Father!

311
00:24:17,098 --> 00:24:19,477
No!

312
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,726
No.

313
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:22,228
Who is it?

314
00:24:22,312 --> 00:24:23,729
It's my father.

315
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:29,984
Who's there?

316
00:24:31,401 --> 00:24:33,987
Who's there?

317
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:35,155
Master Robin?

318
00:24:36,406 --> 00:24:38,494
Is that you?

319
00:24:38,576 --> 00:24:39,701
Duncan?

320
00:24:39,784 --> 00:24:41,494
Oh, praise be.

321
00:24:41,578 --> 00:24:43,997
I thought God
had abandoned us.

322
00:24:44,081 --> 00:24:45,497
Duncan, my father.

323
00:24:45,579 --> 00:24:46,998
Oh, it's a miracle.

324
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:49,501
Why... Why didn't
you cut him down?

325
00:24:49,584 --> 00:24:51,002
It's a miracle.

326
00:24:51,087 --> 00:24:52,169
I never thought that...

327
00:24:52,252 --> 00:24:53,504
Are you deaf?

328
00:24:53,587 --> 00:24:54,506
Easy!

329
00:24:54,588 --> 00:24:56,508
Look at him.

330
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:59,676
I would have done
if I could see.

331
00:25:04,096 --> 00:25:06,515
Who did this to you,
Duncan?

332
00:25:06,598 --> 00:25:08,016
Guy... Guy of Gisborne...

333
00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:11,937
with the sheriff and
his witch looking on.

334
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,938
Why?

335
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,605
They say that the sheriff...

336
00:25:15,691 --> 00:25:18,525
captured your father
worshiping the devil...

337
00:25:18,608 --> 00:25:20,235
that he signed a confession...

338
00:25:20,275 --> 00:25:22,029
before the bishop.

339
00:25:22,112 --> 00:25:24,277
No.

340
00:25:24,363 --> 00:25:26,739
That's not possible.

341
00:25:26,822 --> 00:25:30,367
Nottingham declared
all Locksley lands forfeit.

342
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:32,286
Did you believe the charges?

343
00:25:33,788 --> 00:25:37,581
Not even when
they took my eyes.

344
00:25:48,633 --> 00:25:50,217
We must go.

345
00:25:54,012 --> 00:25:57,222
He loved you till the end,
young master.

346
00:25:57,306 --> 00:26:00,225
He never gave up hope
of your return.

347
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,227
I should have been here.

348
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:07,731
He called the Crusades
a foolish quest.

349
00:26:07,813 --> 00:26:11,153
He said it was vanity
to force other men...

350
00:26:11,235 --> 00:26:13,111
to our religion.

351
00:26:13,153 --> 00:26:15,447
But you must flee now.

352
00:26:15,529 --> 00:26:16,989
Head south to safety.

353
00:26:17,031 --> 00:26:18,990
Gisborne will
surely seek revenge.

354
00:26:19,032 --> 00:26:20,492
I hear you, Duncan.

355
00:26:22,744 --> 00:26:24,080
You should go home.

356
00:26:25,329 --> 00:26:28,332
My world's turned
upside down here.

357
00:26:28,373 --> 00:26:31,627
I cannot ask you to
come where I am going.

358
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:35,297
Alone, Christian, you will
only get yourself killed.

359
00:26:36,422 --> 00:26:37,630
Besides...

360
00:26:37,671 --> 00:26:41,134
there is nothing left
for me to go home to.

361
00:26:46,263 --> 00:26:49,684
I will not rest
until my father is avenged.

362
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:56,396
I swear it...

363
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,607
by my own blood.

364
00:27:09,864 --> 00:27:12,077
What is this place?

365
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,662
Peter's home.

366
00:27:13,745 --> 00:27:17,497
It's nearly six years
since we left together.

367
00:27:17,537 --> 00:27:19,999
We'll find food and shelter here.

368
00:27:24,211 --> 00:27:26,756
No more beggars.

369
00:27:35,012 --> 00:27:36,596
Tell the mistress
of the house...

370
00:27:36,681 --> 00:27:38,431
that Robin of Locksley
is at her door.

371
00:27:38,515 --> 00:27:40,808
Her ladyship's not here.

372
00:27:40,891 --> 00:27:43,310
Is the child Marian at home?

373
00:27:43,394 --> 00:27:46,813
Maybe she is.
Maybe she isn't.

374
00:27:46,897 --> 00:27:47,814
Aah!

375
00:27:47,898 --> 00:27:49,856
Ohh!

376
00:27:49,941 --> 00:27:51,359
The hospitality
in this country...

377
00:27:51,442 --> 00:27:53,401
is as warm as the weather.

378
00:27:55,779 --> 00:27:57,239
It's a joke.

379
00:27:57,282 --> 00:27:58,198
Really?

380
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,781
Leave your weapons!

381
00:28:02,784 --> 00:28:05,327
Just you.

382
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,049
Wait here.

383
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:24,051
Right here?

384
00:28:29,806 --> 00:28:32,767
A curse on Moors
and Saracens.

385
00:28:32,809 --> 00:28:35,768
Were it not for
their ungodly ways...

386
00:28:35,811 --> 00:28:38,272
Master Robin would
never have left.

387
00:28:41,816 --> 00:28:44,278
What manner of name
is Azeem...

388
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:46,822
Irish, Cornish?

389
00:28:48,114 --> 00:28:49,073
Moorish.

390
00:28:53,785 --> 00:28:56,245
Who are you?

391
00:28:57,622 --> 00:28:59,750
Robin of Locksley.

392
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,540
You lie.
Robin is dead.

393
00:29:01,624 --> 00:29:03,250
Step into the light.

394
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:11,257
Turn around.

395
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:17,429
Am I to dance next?

396
00:29:20,265 --> 00:29:21,433
Who are you?

397
00:29:21,515 --> 00:29:23,267
I am the maid Marian.

398
00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:24,936
Well, then show
yourself, child...

399
00:29:24,977 --> 00:29:27,606
for we knew
each other well.

400
00:29:36,488 --> 00:29:39,822
The years have...

401
00:29:39,906 --> 00:29:40,990
been kind.

402
00:29:41,075 --> 00:29:42,493
Thank you.

403
00:29:42,575 --> 00:29:43,993
With the king away...

404
00:29:44,075 --> 00:29:46,161
we must guard against
villainous outlaws...

405
00:29:46,244 --> 00:29:48,413
who would kidnap
a relative of his.

406
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:50,915
Surely you can see
I'm not one of those.

407
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:52,958
Perhaps.

408
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:55,628
Now remove yourself
from this house.

409
00:29:56,962 --> 00:30:00,757
I would, my lady,
but I'm sworn to protect you.

410
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:02,217
Protect me?

411
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:07,136
Robin of Locksley
was nothing but a spoiled bully.

412
00:30:09,096 --> 00:30:10,014
And besides...

413
00:30:10,097 --> 00:30:12,100
as you can see...

414
00:30:12,183 --> 00:30:13,559
we have enough protection.

415
00:30:13,643 --> 00:30:14,811
Marian, wait.

416
00:30:16,937 --> 00:30:21,481
You are truly courageous
against an unarmed man.

417
00:30:27,695 --> 00:30:28,655
Aah!

418
00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:35,200
Point me toward danger,
Azeem. I'm ready.

419
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,635
Stop! Stop!

420
00:31:02,391 --> 00:31:04,518
Aah!

421
00:31:04,561 --> 00:31:05,684
Ohh!

422
00:31:06,811 --> 00:31:08,521
Ohh!

423
00:31:10,898 --> 00:31:13,233
Hello, Marian.

424
00:31:21,114 --> 00:31:23,616
His last thoughts were of you.

425
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,954
Oh, Peter.

426
00:31:31,373 --> 00:31:33,041
Oh, God.

427
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:36,084
I'm sorry, Marian.

428
00:31:36,167 --> 00:31:38,127
I'm sorry.

429
00:31:39,922 --> 00:31:42,380
How do I know
you didn't abandon him...

430
00:31:42,423 --> 00:31:44,426
to save your own skin?

431
00:31:44,508 --> 00:31:47,428
No one feels his loss
more than I.

432
00:31:47,511 --> 00:31:49,511
The next time I visit London...

433
00:31:49,596 --> 00:31:51,055
I'll convey your condolences...

434
00:31:51,139 --> 00:31:52,598
to my mother.

435
00:31:52,682 --> 00:31:54,601
I would think,
for your safety...

436
00:31:54,683 --> 00:31:56,602
that you would
join her there.

437
00:31:56,686 --> 00:31:59,729
No. I have no interest
in life at court.

438
00:31:59,813 --> 00:32:01,271
All that gossip mongering...

439
00:32:01,314 --> 00:32:02,732
and currying favor.

440
00:32:03,983 --> 00:32:06,736
But you're alone here.

441
00:32:06,819 --> 00:32:08,401
Hardly.

442
00:32:08,444 --> 00:32:11,364
These years have left us
many in need.

443
00:32:11,447 --> 00:32:14,575
While you and my brother
were off playing boy heroes...

444
00:32:14,616 --> 00:32:16,577
Nottingham has
plundered the shire.

445
00:32:16,618 --> 00:32:19,870
I see you still
have your lands.

446
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:25,085
Because I give them
no excuse to take them.

447
00:32:25,168 --> 00:32:26,584
I am the king's cousin.

448
00:32:26,668 --> 00:32:29,295
It is my station
to look after these people...

449
00:32:29,378 --> 00:32:30,756
until his return.

450
00:32:35,801 --> 00:32:40,054
Marian.

451
00:32:41,429 --> 00:32:45,225
My purpose in coming
was not to hurt you.

452
00:32:45,307 --> 00:32:46,726
I swore...

453
00:32:46,811 --> 00:32:50,230
I swore to your brother
that I would protect you.

454
00:32:50,313 --> 00:32:53,524
You cannot replace
my brother.

455
00:32:53,607 --> 00:32:55,318
I don't...

456
00:32:55,401 --> 00:32:57,443
I don't want to replace him.

457
00:32:57,527 --> 00:33:00,988
Marian, I've returned to my home
to find it destroyed...

458
00:33:01,029 --> 00:33:02,157
and my father murdered.

459
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,447
And the only
explanations for it...

460
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:07,493
are the ramblings
of an old blind man.

461
00:33:07,535 --> 00:33:09,494
All I remember of you...

462
00:33:09,536 --> 00:33:14,457
is a spoiled bully
who used to burn my hair as a child.

463
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:18,044
Please allow that years
of war and prison...

464
00:33:18,127 --> 00:33:20,003
may change a man.

465
00:33:23,715 --> 00:33:25,134
Robin, whatever happened...

466
00:33:25,216 --> 00:33:28,135
between you and your father...

467
00:33:28,218 --> 00:33:29,637
you mustn't believe...

468
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:31,554
what they accused him of.

469
00:33:31,638 --> 00:33:33,307
I don't.

470
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:46,901
Look.

471
00:34:09,045 --> 00:34:11,503
How did your uneducated kind...

472
00:34:11,545 --> 00:34:13,464
ever takeJerusalem?

473
00:34:13,547 --> 00:34:15,341
God knows.

474
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,509
What is it?

475
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:26,682
What is it?

476
00:34:26,726 --> 00:34:28,018
It's Nottingham's soldiers.

477
00:34:28,061 --> 00:34:30,228
Coming here?
Is this your protection?

478
00:34:30,311 --> 00:34:33,188
I killed some
of the sheriff s men.

479
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,189
Oh, dear.

480
00:34:34,232 --> 00:34:36,691
I fear I've placed
you in danger.

481
00:34:37,733 --> 00:34:40,404
I can take care
of myself. Just go.

482
00:34:40,487 --> 00:34:41,905
No. That's my horse.

483
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:44,990
A truly magnificent
animal, milady.

484
00:34:51,496 --> 00:34:52,747
Go!

485
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:54,997
I said I'm sworn to protect you.

486
00:34:55,081 --> 00:34:56,833
And I say no more
boyish gestures.

487
00:34:56,916 --> 00:34:58,710
I'm not leaving.

488
00:35:01,336 --> 00:35:02,547
Stop them!

489
00:35:02,587 --> 00:35:05,214
They're stealing my horses!

490
00:35:05,258 --> 00:35:06,925
You're so kind, Marian.

491
00:35:07,008 --> 00:35:07,883
Ooh!

492
00:35:27,357 --> 00:35:29,442
You've been sheltering
outlaws, Lady Marian?

493
00:35:29,528 --> 00:35:30,863
They're thieves, you imbecile.

494
00:35:30,946 --> 00:35:34,073
Lucky he didn't steal
your virtue as well.

495
00:35:34,156 --> 00:35:37,575
A crown to the man
who brings me Locksley's head!

496
00:35:37,618 --> 00:35:40,411
Milady. Hyah!

497
00:36:20,152 --> 00:36:22,612
Have we lost them?

498
00:36:22,654 --> 00:36:24,072
No.

499
00:36:24,155 --> 00:36:27,116
My horse carries two.

500
00:36:27,158 --> 00:36:29,451
Yours is lame.
We cannot outrun them.

501
00:36:29,533 --> 00:36:30,994
Leave me, Master Robin.

502
00:36:31,076 --> 00:36:32,620
I slow your escape.

503
00:36:32,704 --> 00:36:35,289
We can lose them
in the forest.

504
00:36:35,372 --> 00:36:37,165
Sherwood Forest
is haunted, master.

505
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:39,836
Either we take our chances
with the ghosts...

506
00:36:39,919 --> 00:36:41,418
or become ghosts ourselves.

507
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,523
Come on, damn you!
There are only three of them!

508
00:37:06,607 --> 00:37:11,070
It's not the men we fear.
It's the evil spirits.

509
00:37:11,152 --> 00:37:12,986
Robin of the Hood...

510
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:16,364
son of a devil worshiper!

511
00:37:16,448 --> 00:37:18,073
Your father died a coward...

512
00:37:18,157 --> 00:37:19,574
cursing your name...

513
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,035
and squealing
like a stuck pig!

514
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:24,496
You will bring no justice
to your father...

515
00:37:24,538 --> 00:37:26,791
by dying today.

516
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:55,689
Master Robin?

517
00:37:55,772 --> 00:37:59,525
There are your
ghosts, Duncan...

518
00:37:59,567 --> 00:38:01,234
wind chimes.

519
00:38:01,319 --> 00:38:04,405
A child's toy
put to good use.

520
00:38:04,487 --> 00:38:07,575
You scare easily,
my painted Moor.

521
00:38:11,535 --> 00:38:14,579
This forest has eyes.

522
00:38:14,662 --> 00:38:16,080
I swear it.

523
00:38:34,263 --> 00:38:35,680
In my dreams alone...

524
00:38:35,763 --> 00:38:38,516
have I imagined
such a place.

525
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:43,144
Then imagine
a way to cross it.

526
00:39:14,337 --> 00:39:15,755
There's hope!

527
00:39:21,385 --> 00:39:24,095
# There was a rich man
from Nottingham #

528
00:39:24,137 --> 00:39:26,721
# Who tried
to cross the river #

529
00:39:26,805 --> 00:39:29,099
# What a dope,
he tripped on a rope #

530
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,434
# Now look at him shiver ##

531
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:34,520
Beg for mercy, rich man!

532
00:39:36,353 --> 00:39:40,108
I beg of no man.

533
00:39:42,986 --> 00:39:44,277
Aah!

534
00:39:47,697 --> 00:39:49,741
Well, this here
is our river...

535
00:39:49,825 --> 00:39:52,829
and any man
who wishes to cross...

536
00:39:52,869 --> 00:39:54,160
must pay a tax.

537
00:39:54,243 --> 00:39:57,121
I will pay no tax.

538
00:39:57,163 --> 00:39:58,624
As you can see...

539
00:39:58,706 --> 00:40:01,417
I have nothing...

540
00:40:01,501 --> 00:40:03,085
not even my sword.

541
00:40:03,169 --> 00:40:04,962
Bollocks!

542
00:40:05,045 --> 00:40:07,462
Any man who travels
with two servants...

543
00:40:07,548 --> 00:40:10,465
and claims he's got
no bloody money...

544
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:11,969
is either a fool...

545
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:13,593
or a liar.

546
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:15,637
Yeah, he's a liar!

547
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:17,180
Who are you?

548
00:40:17,264 --> 00:40:19,139
John Little...

549
00:40:20,517 --> 00:40:22,392
best man of the woods.

550
00:40:22,477 --> 00:40:25,435
- Yeah!
- Yay!

551
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:30,151
Well, best man,
do you lead this rabble?

552
00:40:30,191 --> 00:40:31,150
- Whoa!
- Oh!

553
00:40:31,191 --> 00:40:33,236
Yes, I do, mate.

554
00:40:33,318 --> 00:40:36,737
And if you tosspots want to travel
through Sherwood Forest...

555
00:40:36,822 --> 00:40:39,615
it's going to cost you...

556
00:40:39,698 --> 00:40:41,658
that gold medallion.

557
00:40:45,411 --> 00:40:47,371
This is sacred to me.

558
00:40:47,454 --> 00:40:50,330
It's sacred to us,
too, matey.

559
00:40:50,415 --> 00:40:53,169
That there will feed us
for a blooming month.

560
00:40:53,252 --> 00:40:56,336
You'll have to
fight me for it.

561
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,796
Whoa! Whoa!

562
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,714
Love to, mate.

563
00:40:59,799 --> 00:41:02,800
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

564
00:41:06,054 --> 00:41:07,514
Be careful, Father.

565
00:41:07,555 --> 00:41:10,557
He walloped 12 of
the sheriff s men.

566
00:41:10,641 --> 00:41:12,057
Is that so?

567
00:41:12,142 --> 00:41:14,728
Reckon I'm going
to enjoy this.

568
00:41:15,853 --> 00:41:17,396
Hey!

569
00:41:17,479 --> 00:41:19,482
That's your father?

570
00:41:20,607 --> 00:41:22,650
Come on, John!

571
00:41:22,734 --> 00:41:25,321
Knock him over, John!

572
00:41:34,285 --> 00:41:36,205
Ha ha ha ha!

573
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,879
Whoa!

574
00:41:52,508 --> 00:41:56,011
He's drowning!

575
00:41:56,094 --> 00:41:58,220
Lost something?

576
00:41:59,429 --> 00:42:03,142
Thanks for the taxes.
Ha ha ha!

577
00:42:03,227 --> 00:42:04,810
Looks like
the little rich boy...

578
00:42:04,892 --> 00:42:06,646
is lost for words, eh?

579
00:42:07,814 --> 00:42:09,773
Any great ideas?

580
00:42:09,855 --> 00:42:11,065
Get up!

581
00:42:11,106 --> 00:42:12,525
Move faster!

582
00:42:12,609 --> 00:42:14,443
Move faster.

583
00:42:14,527 --> 00:42:15,444
Great idea.

584
00:42:22,407 --> 00:42:23,867
Watch it, John!

585
00:42:28,248 --> 00:42:29,663
We're not through yet.

586
00:42:29,746 --> 00:42:32,165
All right, my old cocker.

587
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:34,460
You want another
good walloping?

588
00:42:34,544 --> 00:42:36,043
You shall have one.

589
00:42:47,304 --> 00:42:48,387
Ohh!

590
00:42:48,471 --> 00:42:51,098
Seems I've made it
past the gate, John Little.

591
00:42:51,181 --> 00:42:53,809
Or should I call you
LittleJohn?

592
00:42:53,891 --> 00:42:55,602
Hit him, Father! Wallop him!

593
00:43:18,037 --> 00:43:20,457
Swimming time again,
old chum.

594
00:43:20,498 --> 00:43:22,498
Ohh!

595
00:43:34,633 --> 00:43:36,053
Where is he?

596
00:43:36,136 --> 00:43:37,595
Do you see him?

597
00:43:50,146 --> 00:43:52,775
It's a bloomin' shame.

598
00:43:52,857 --> 00:43:54,942
He was a brave lad.

599
00:43:56,526 --> 00:43:58,154
Ooh! Aah!

600
00:43:59,821 --> 00:44:01,907
Help!

601
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:03,407
Do you yield?

602
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:04,909
I can't bloody swim!

603
00:44:07,161 --> 00:44:08,536
Do you yield?

604
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:09,538
Yes!

605
00:44:09,621 --> 00:44:12,123
Good. Now put
your feet down.

606
00:44:18,504 --> 00:44:19,838
I'll be buggered.

607
00:44:21,881 --> 00:44:24,340
- The medallion.
- Give me your name first.

608
00:44:25,676 --> 00:44:27,636
Robin of Locksley.

609
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:30,931
Well,
Robin of Locksley...

610
00:44:31,013 --> 00:44:33,350
you got balls of solid rock.

611
00:44:33,392 --> 00:44:34,349
Come on.

612
00:44:38,521 --> 00:44:40,355
That's Much,
the Miller's son...

613
00:44:40,437 --> 00:44:41,606
Harold Brownwell...

614
00:44:41,689 --> 00:44:44,107
and that stumpy one there
is David of Doncaster...

615
00:44:44,191 --> 00:44:47,110
but the lads
all calls him Bull.

616
00:44:48,194 --> 00:44:49,529
'Cause you're short?

617
00:44:49,612 --> 00:44:52,865
No. It's 'cause
I'm so long!

618
00:44:55,575 --> 00:44:57,202
Yeah, look.

619
00:44:57,244 --> 00:45:00,580
No, Bull.
Save it. Save it for the ladies.

620
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:02,665
Give the man some mead.

621
00:45:02,748 --> 00:45:05,082
Very good, isn't it?

622
00:45:06,459 --> 00:45:09,086
Now, I made that myself.

623
00:45:09,171 --> 00:45:12,631
Has English hospitality
changed so much in six years...

624
00:45:12,715 --> 00:45:16,635
that a friend of mine's
not welcome at this table?

625
00:45:16,718 --> 00:45:18,636
But he's a savage, sire.

626
00:45:20,221 --> 00:45:22,765
That he is.

627
00:45:22,849 --> 00:45:25,558
But no more than you or I.

628
00:45:28,728 --> 00:45:30,645
And don't call me sire.

629
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:35,898
With regret, I must decline.

630
00:45:37,024 --> 00:45:38,528
Allah forbids it.

631
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,237
Your bloody loss, mate.

632
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:43,657
How is it there are
so many of you in hiding?

633
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,075
Well, we're all outlaws.

634
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:47,285
Got prices on our heads.

635
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:49,161
Even the young lad there.

636
00:45:49,243 --> 00:45:50,579
He's a blasted sheriff.

637
00:45:50,996 --> 00:45:53,333
He says we owes him taxes.

638
00:45:53,416 --> 00:45:54,832
Well, you know,
your ghost...

639
00:45:54,916 --> 00:45:58,169
will only keep the sheriff s men
at bay so long.

640
00:45:58,251 --> 00:45:59,670
They've worked so far.

641
00:45:59,755 --> 00:46:01,671
You have a better idea?

642
00:46:06,758 --> 00:46:08,386
You can always fight back.

643
00:46:08,469 --> 00:46:10,304
Yeah.
Ha ha ha ha.

644
00:46:11,722 --> 00:46:15,184
I reckon I must have cracked
that noble head of yours.

645
00:46:15,266 --> 00:46:17,685
These are all good lads here.

646
00:46:17,769 --> 00:46:20,312
They got hearts of oak,
but they're farmers.

647
00:46:22,439 --> 00:46:24,191
It'd be lambs
to the slaughter.

648
00:46:24,274 --> 00:46:27,860
They say the sheriff
was raised by a witch.

649
00:46:27,942 --> 00:46:28,861
Witch?

650
00:46:28,943 --> 00:46:30,529
She knows
every man's thoughts.

651
00:46:30,612 --> 00:46:32,446
You can see
right through her...

652
00:46:32,488 --> 00:46:33,572
and she flies.

653
00:46:33,656 --> 00:46:35,282
That's a load
of codswallop.

654
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:37,702
What does the rich son
of a devil worshiper care...

655
00:46:37,786 --> 00:46:38,826
about outlaw peasants?

656
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:40,913
My lord was a kind
and generous man!

657
00:46:40,995 --> 00:46:43,916
Who among you dares
believe him capable...

658
00:46:43,999 --> 00:46:46,918
Duncan. My father was
no devil worshiper...

659
00:46:47,001 --> 00:46:51,294
and I'll have words with any man
who says otherwise.

660
00:46:53,923 --> 00:46:55,341
But he's right.

661
00:46:57,592 --> 00:47:00,011
I was a rich man's son.

662
00:47:02,098 --> 00:47:05,349
But when I killed
the sheriff s men...

663
00:47:05,432 --> 00:47:08,186
I became an outlaw
like you.

664
00:47:08,269 --> 00:47:09,643
You are nothing like us.

665
00:47:11,604 --> 00:47:14,315
Well... that there's
Will Scarlett.

666
00:47:14,399 --> 00:47:16,524
Don't take no note of him.

667
00:47:16,607 --> 00:47:18,527
He's full of piss and wind.

668
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:20,487
Come on, lads, drink up.

669
00:47:20,569 --> 00:47:24,156
Stop talking
so much bloody rubbish.

670
00:47:24,198 --> 00:47:27,742
This here is the best
we simple men can expect.

671
00:47:27,825 --> 00:47:29,245
Here we're safe.

672
00:47:30,786 --> 00:47:32,203
Here...

673
00:47:32,288 --> 00:47:33,996
we are kings.

674
00:47:34,081 --> 00:47:36,708
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

675
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:56,057
Aah!

676
00:47:58,643 --> 00:48:00,562
Too much mead, old friend?

677
00:48:00,645 --> 00:48:02,562
Oh, forgive me.
I oversleep.

678
00:48:02,645 --> 00:48:04,273
No, no.
Rest yourself.

679
00:48:14,156 --> 00:48:16,075
What day is it, Duncan?

680
00:48:16,158 --> 00:48:17,574
Sunday, I think.

681
00:48:19,161 --> 00:48:22,079
Do they still give alms
to the poor at mass?

682
00:48:22,163 --> 00:48:23,580
That they do.

683
00:48:23,662 --> 00:48:25,582
These days,
the need for mercy...

684
00:48:25,664 --> 00:48:27,083
is greater than ever.

685
00:48:43,596 --> 00:48:46,056
Well, my other god calls.

686
00:48:47,349 --> 00:48:50,227
Oh, don't upset
yourself, Mortianna.

687
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:52,853
Appearances are important
to that lot.

688
00:48:52,936 --> 00:48:54,896
Especially on a Sunday.

689
00:48:54,981 --> 00:48:58,901
You know my true faith
lies in the old ways.

690
00:49:00,779 --> 00:49:02,738
Although...

691
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:05,656
frankly sometimes...

692
00:49:07,282 --> 00:49:09,659
I can't see much difference.

693
00:49:12,621 --> 00:49:14,578
Did my parents truly tell you...

694
00:49:14,621 --> 00:49:17,374
to instruct me in all this?

695
00:49:18,542 --> 00:49:21,253
Their dying wish.

696
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:37,558
Come on.

697
00:50:00,158 --> 00:50:03,787
We beseech thy blessing,
Lord...

698
00:50:03,829 --> 00:50:05,414
on all your people...

699
00:50:06,832 --> 00:50:08,917
but most especially...

700
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,628
on our noble sheriff
of Nottingham.

701
00:50:12,837 --> 00:50:14,797
Grant him the wisdom...

702
00:50:14,839 --> 00:50:19,465
to guide and protect
our glorious city.

703
00:50:19,508 --> 00:50:21,968
Grant him also
the strength...

704
00:50:22,011 --> 00:50:23,972
to bring to justice...

705
00:50:24,013 --> 00:50:27,808
the lawless men who would
threaten its safety...

706
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:30,309
and prosperity...

707
00:50:30,351 --> 00:50:33,438
and the judgment
to punish them...

708
00:50:33,521 --> 00:50:35,313
in your name.

709
00:50:35,355 --> 00:50:36,772
Amen.

710
00:50:36,856 --> 00:50:38,984
- Amen.
- Amen.

711
00:50:39,067 --> 00:50:41,609
Go in peace.

712
00:50:43,737 --> 00:50:45,488
Alms, please, sir.

713
00:50:46,738 --> 00:50:47,947
Please, madam.

714
00:50:49,866 --> 00:50:51,827
- Sarah.
- Yes.

715
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:53,829
Thank you.

716
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:54,830
Ma'am.

717
00:50:54,871 --> 00:50:56,205
That's all I have.

718
00:50:56,289 --> 00:50:57,499
God bless you, mum.

719
00:51:15,388 --> 00:51:17,846
Alms for a blind man, milady?

720
00:51:17,889 --> 00:51:19,349
Mmm.

721
00:51:19,391 --> 00:51:22,018
For one who cannot
see your beauty.

722
00:51:25,563 --> 00:51:26,521
Hello.

723
00:51:26,564 --> 00:51:29,024
What are you doing here?

724
00:51:29,066 --> 00:51:30,858
Searching my soul.

725
00:51:30,899 --> 00:51:34,864
I do not wish to be seen
with an outlaw.

726
00:51:34,905 --> 00:51:37,365
You prefer the company
of Nottingham?

727
00:51:37,406 --> 00:51:39,366
There's a price
on your head.

728
00:51:39,407 --> 00:51:40,366
How much?

729
00:51:40,409 --> 00:51:41,868
100 gold pieces.

730
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:43,369
Is that all?

731
00:51:43,409 --> 00:51:45,871
I'll have to annoy
the good sheriff more.

732
00:51:45,913 --> 00:51:47,874
Soon it will be 1,000.

733
00:51:47,917 --> 00:51:50,875
For 1,000, I would
turn you in myself.

734
00:51:50,917 --> 00:51:52,877
Nottingham is
mounting an army.

735
00:51:52,919 --> 00:51:55,379
He has every blacksmith
in the county...

736
00:51:55,421 --> 00:51:57,882
in the castle,
making swords and armor.

737
00:51:57,924 --> 00:51:59,382
What is he planning?

738
00:51:59,423 --> 00:52:01,883
I don't know,
but there's no limit...

739
00:52:01,925 --> 00:52:03,052
to the man's ambitions.

740
00:52:04,427 --> 00:52:05,720
Go!

741
00:52:05,762 --> 00:52:06,722
Thank you.

742
00:52:06,764 --> 00:52:07,721
Quickly! Go!

743
00:52:08,932 --> 00:52:10,391
Robin, do something for me.

744
00:52:10,432 --> 00:52:11,391
What?

745
00:52:11,433 --> 00:52:12,602
Take a bath.

746
00:52:12,685 --> 00:52:13,851
Take a bath?

747
00:52:33,954 --> 00:52:36,746
These are my private
chambers, my son.

748
00:52:38,457 --> 00:52:40,916
I have priests
who would hear your confession.

749
00:52:40,958 --> 00:52:42,208
- Gggt!
- Aah!

750
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:44,712
Shh!

751
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:51,757
I see the boy I knew
in the man before me.

752
00:52:53,635 --> 00:52:56,638
Welcome home, Robin.

753
00:52:56,722 --> 00:52:59,558
You shine like
the sun, milady.

754
00:52:59,641 --> 00:53:02,560
You've been meeting
with Robin of Locksley.

755
00:53:02,643 --> 00:53:03,934
My cousin tells me...

756
00:53:03,976 --> 00:53:06,938
the knave deprived
you of some horses.

757
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,441
Oh... yes.

758
00:53:08,481 --> 00:53:09,940
A most disagreeable
experience.

759
00:53:09,983 --> 00:53:12,442
Yes, I know.
And for inflicting that upon you...

760
00:53:12,484 --> 00:53:15,945
I'm going to hang him
from the walls by his own entrails.

761
00:53:15,986 --> 00:53:17,447
I'd like to see that.

762
00:53:17,489 --> 00:53:19,073
If you'd bring
your household...

763
00:53:19,156 --> 00:53:20,449
within the city walls...

764
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:22,949
I could give your every need
my personal attention.

765
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:25,453
I do thank you,
but I prefer to stay...

766
00:53:25,494 --> 00:53:27,456
in my family's home
for now.

767
00:53:27,497 --> 00:53:30,958
Oh. Well, then, perhaps
you'd do me the honor...

768
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,960
of accepting
a small token...

769
00:53:33,002 --> 00:53:35,669
of my undying devotion
to your safety.

770
00:53:35,752 --> 00:53:37,964
Oh!

771
00:53:38,005 --> 00:53:40,966
Why... King Richard
will be deeply moved...

772
00:53:41,007 --> 00:53:44,092
to hear of your concern
for my welfare.

773
00:53:44,177 --> 00:53:45,135
Yes, um...

774
00:53:45,177 --> 00:53:47,971
I'm afraid the king
has many enemies...

775
00:53:48,013 --> 00:53:49,973
both abroad
and at home.

776
00:53:50,015 --> 00:53:51,976
I fear for his safe return.

777
00:53:52,018 --> 00:53:53,975
Oh, no. Fear not,
dear sheriff.

778
00:53:54,017 --> 00:53:56,478
He will return,
and when he does...

779
00:53:56,519 --> 00:53:59,315
he will wish to reward
his faithful subjects.

780
00:54:03,193 --> 00:54:06,110
I asked your father
three times...

781
00:54:06,194 --> 00:54:08,988
if he worshiped
the dark one...

782
00:54:09,031 --> 00:54:12,992
because his answer
vexed me so grievously.

783
00:54:13,034 --> 00:54:14,993
He said...

784
00:54:15,077 --> 00:54:20,999
he must meet God
with a clear conscience.

785
00:54:30,216 --> 00:54:31,882
You lie.

786
00:54:38,805 --> 00:54:39,723
On your souls...

787
00:54:39,806 --> 00:54:42,183
do not shed blood
in the house of God!

788
00:54:50,716 --> 00:54:51,800
You bastard!

789
00:54:51,883 --> 00:54:52,924
In there!

790
00:54:54,424 --> 00:54:57,592
Get him!

791
00:55:01,593 --> 00:55:02,635
Locksley!

792
00:55:02,718 --> 00:55:05,051
I'm going to cut
your heart out...

793
00:55:05,092 --> 00:55:06,801
with a spoon!

794
00:55:06,884 --> 00:55:08,760
Then it begins.

795
00:55:13,093 --> 00:55:15,051
Aah!

796
00:55:23,636 --> 00:55:24,553
Aah!

797
00:55:24,637 --> 00:55:27,387
He's taking
the sheriff s horse!

798
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:33,387
Close the gate!

799
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:35,929
The sheriffs horse!
Close the gate!

800
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:38,429
He's stolen
the sheriff s horse!

801
00:55:45,055 --> 00:55:46,596
Uhh!

802
00:55:56,473 --> 00:55:58,390
What are you looking at?

803
00:56:10,641 --> 00:56:12,599
There's a rider coming in!

804
00:56:18,976 --> 00:56:20,058
Water!

805
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:21,058
Thank you.

806
00:56:21,101 --> 00:56:22,559
For the animal.

807
00:56:22,642 --> 00:56:24,561
How can I protect you,
Christian...

808
00:56:24,643 --> 00:56:27,060
if I know not
where you go?

809
00:56:27,102 --> 00:56:29,060
You've hardly raised
a finger...

810
00:56:29,101 --> 00:56:30,726
when you do know...

811
00:56:30,809 --> 00:56:31,725
great one.

812
00:56:32,977 --> 00:56:34,893
I prefer to have
the choice.

813
00:56:34,977 --> 00:56:37,393
Wonderful. You've stolen
the sheriff s horse?

814
00:56:37,476 --> 00:56:40,393
You've stirred up
a bloody hornet's nest now!

815
00:56:40,477 --> 00:56:41,895
Are you afraid, John?

816
00:56:41,978 --> 00:56:43,395
Yeah, a little.

817
00:56:43,477 --> 00:56:44,895
Well, so is the sheriff.

818
00:56:44,978 --> 00:56:47,563
Today I gave him a sting
he'll not forget.

819
00:56:47,646 --> 00:56:50,062
You fool!
You've started a war!

820
00:56:50,104 --> 00:56:51,562
We're already at war.

821
00:56:53,313 --> 00:56:54,311
Duncan...

822
00:56:54,395 --> 00:56:55,312
bread.

823
00:56:57,645 --> 00:56:59,562
And I say we strike back...

824
00:56:59,645 --> 00:57:01,564
at the very man
who takes our homes...

825
00:57:01,646 --> 00:57:02,895
and would
hunt our children.

826
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:03,896
We?

827
00:57:03,981 --> 00:57:06,563
You planning to
join us then, matey?

828
00:57:07,813 --> 00:57:09,314
No, to lead you.

829
00:57:14,106 --> 00:57:15,898
Christian...

830
00:57:15,982 --> 00:57:17,481
these are simple people.

831
00:57:18,565 --> 00:57:19,982
They are not warriors.

832
00:57:20,065 --> 00:57:22,565
Be careful
you do not do this...

833
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:23,900
for your own purposes.

834
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,232
You forget yourself, Azeem.

835
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:28,065
I do not ask for your company
or counsel.

836
00:57:29,984 --> 00:57:32,066
Why a spoon, cousin?

837
00:57:32,107 --> 00:57:34,066
Why not an ax
or something...

838
00:57:34,107 --> 00:57:36,065
Because it's dull, you twit!

839
00:57:36,108 --> 00:57:38,401
It'll hurt more!

840
00:57:38,483 --> 00:57:42,067
I want this brigand found.

841
00:57:42,109 --> 00:57:43,568
Starve them out!

842
00:57:43,651 --> 00:57:44,567
Slaughter their...

843
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:46,568
No, take their livestock.

844
00:57:46,651 --> 00:57:50,067
I want Locksley's own people
fighting to bring his head in.

845
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:53,068
Well, perhaps we could create
a name for him...

846
00:57:53,111 --> 00:57:56,067
something to drive fear
into the hearts of the populace.

847
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:58,609
Maybe Locksley the Lethal
or Wreaking Robin or...

848
00:57:58,652 --> 00:57:59,653
Whatever!

849
00:57:59,735 --> 00:58:01,359
I want him dead
by the next full moon...

850
00:58:01,444 --> 00:58:03,862
before the barons
come back.

851
00:58:03,945 --> 00:58:05,026
Now sew...

852
00:58:07,111 --> 00:58:10,737
and keep the stitches small!

853
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:30,488
He's not here, sir.

854
00:58:31,905 --> 00:58:34,823
Where is your mate,
the man they call Little?

855
00:58:34,906 --> 00:58:36,740
He died last winter.

856
00:58:36,824 --> 00:58:38,822
Burn it down.

857
00:58:38,906 --> 00:58:40,657
Light the other one.

858
00:58:45,366 --> 00:58:48,117
Leave us the sow.
Her young will feed us.

859
00:58:48,158 --> 00:58:50,783
Beware of
the Sherwood bandit.

860
00:58:50,823 --> 00:58:52,656
Robin of the Hood?
Yes, sir.

861
00:58:52,741 --> 00:58:55,991
Pray he's brought to us
before winter.

862
00:59:01,117 --> 00:59:02,243
Ma!

863
00:59:02,325 --> 00:59:03,492
Over here!

864
00:59:14,369 --> 00:59:16,036
Oh, John!

865
00:59:16,118 --> 00:59:17,329
Papa!

866
00:59:17,411 --> 00:59:19,577
They burned it, all of it.

867
00:59:21,328 --> 00:59:24,076
Where is this
Robin Hood now?

868
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:25,953
He's there.

869
00:59:26,994 --> 00:59:30,454
Look! Look what
they've done!

870
00:59:33,911 --> 00:59:36,997
If it's fame
you seek, Christian...

871
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:38,997
I think you have it.

872
00:59:41,913 --> 00:59:44,413
You brought this misery
on us, Locksley.

873
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:46,913
It's Nottingham
trying to divide us.

874
00:59:46,998 --> 00:59:48,912
We are divided, rich boy.

875
00:59:48,996 --> 00:59:51,912
I'm not as blind
as that old man.

876
00:59:51,996 --> 00:59:54,914
You're still trying to be
lord of the manor.

877
00:59:54,997 --> 00:59:57,831
I heard today the sheriff
now values your neck...

878
00:59:57,914 --> 00:59:59,582
at 500 gold pieces.

879
01:00:01,124 --> 01:00:03,623
I say we take him in.

880
01:00:03,665 --> 01:00:05,249
- Aye.
- Aye.

881
01:00:05,291 --> 01:00:07,958
Do you think the sheriff
will return everything...

882
01:00:08,042 --> 01:00:09,458
after I'm gone?

883
01:00:09,499 --> 01:00:12,207
He'll give us the reward
and our pardons.

884
01:00:12,292 --> 01:00:13,459
Wrong.

885
01:00:15,583 --> 01:00:18,458
He'll stretch your
necks one by one.

886
01:00:18,542 --> 01:00:21,083
What would you
have us do...

887
01:00:21,124 --> 01:00:23,082
fight armored men
on horseback...

888
01:00:23,125 --> 01:00:25,584
with rocks
and our bare hands?

889
01:00:25,666 --> 01:00:27,083
If needs be.

890
01:00:27,126 --> 01:00:29,751
But with
the one true weapon...

891
01:00:29,835 --> 01:00:31,418
that escapes you, Will...

892
01:00:32,877 --> 01:00:34,335
courage.

893
01:00:42,211 --> 01:00:44,085
Look out!

894
01:00:57,963 --> 01:00:59,463
Thank you, Wulf.

895
01:01:01,213 --> 01:01:03,130
You wish to end this?

896
01:01:03,213 --> 01:01:05,254
You wish to go home?

897
01:01:05,339 --> 01:01:08,380
Then we must stop
fighting amongst ourselves...

898
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:12,255
and face that the price
for it may be dear.

899
01:01:12,296 --> 01:01:14,129
I for one
would rather die...

900
01:01:14,214 --> 01:01:17,298
than to spend my life
in hiding.

901
01:01:17,381 --> 01:01:19,465
The sheriff calls us outlaws...

902
01:01:19,547 --> 01:01:22,007
but I say we are free.

903
01:01:22,089 --> 01:01:25,216
And one free man
defending his home...

904
01:01:25,298 --> 01:01:29,257
is more powerful
than 10 hired soldiers.

905
01:01:30,673 --> 01:01:32,758
The Crusades taught me that.

906
01:01:36,425 --> 01:01:39,592
I will make you
no promises save one...

907
01:01:41,008 --> 01:01:43,925
that if you truly believe
in your hearts...

908
01:01:44,009 --> 01:01:45,425
that you are free...

909
01:01:45,468 --> 01:01:47,759
then I say we can win.

910
01:01:47,842 --> 01:01:49,301
They got armor.

911
01:01:49,343 --> 01:01:50,425
Yeah! Right!

912
01:01:50,509 --> 01:01:52,177
They got armor, Bull?

913
01:01:52,259 --> 01:01:53,968
Even this boy
can be taught...

914
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:56,469
to find chinks
in every suit of armor.

915
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:58,595
We ain't got nothing to eat.

916
01:01:58,677 --> 01:02:01,636
What do we need that
the forest cannot provide?

917
01:02:01,677 --> 01:02:04,261
We have food,
wood for weapons.

918
01:02:04,302 --> 01:02:07,428
We'll find safety
and solace in her trees.

919
01:02:07,470 --> 01:02:09,428
Yeah, but
what about our kin?

920
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:12,178
Sheriff s taken
all they got, too.

921
01:02:14,804 --> 01:02:17,638
Then, by God,
we take it back.

922
01:03:09,017 --> 01:03:10,267
Ho!

923
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:56,607
Hyah!

924
01:04:01,481 --> 01:04:04,232
What's the meaning of this?

925
01:04:04,315 --> 01:04:06,732
Milady, a woman
of your beauty...

926
01:04:06,815 --> 01:04:08,482
has no need for
such decorations.

927
01:04:08,523 --> 01:04:10,607
How dare you!

928
01:04:19,485 --> 01:04:23,692
Please don't take that.

929
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:26,859
Please, sir, those
belong to our lord.

930
01:04:26,943 --> 01:04:29,443
Now they belong
to my lord sheriff!

931
01:04:40,653 --> 01:04:42,611
- Yay!
- Ha ha!

932
01:04:42,652 --> 01:04:45,153
Give it back.

933
01:04:45,195 --> 01:04:46,653
Good.
Tell the sheriff...

934
01:04:46,695 --> 01:04:49,361
for every harm he
does these people...

935
01:04:49,445 --> 01:04:52,445
I will visit it
back on him tenfold.

936
01:05:01,238 --> 01:05:03,153
Something vexes thee?

937
01:05:14,531 --> 01:05:16,115
What the devil?

938
01:05:16,198 --> 01:05:18,156
'Tis a hot day,
my friend...

939
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,657
to burden your horse
with a heavy purse.

940
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:23,615
The sheriff will hear of this.

941
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:29,156
I truly hope so.

942
01:05:29,199 --> 01:05:30,408
Yeah!

943
01:05:37,575 --> 01:05:38,534
There, luv.

944
01:05:38,618 --> 01:05:40,117
Buy yourself
a new sow.

945
01:05:40,158 --> 01:05:42,784
God bless you, Fanny...

946
01:05:42,826 --> 01:05:44,951
and God bless Robin Hood.

947
01:05:47,784 --> 01:05:50,702
We reckon he's nicked
three to four million...

948
01:05:50,784 --> 01:05:53,618
in the last
five months, sire.

949
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:57,118
All right, fine.
Raise the bounty on his head.

950
01:05:57,159 --> 01:05:58,868
25,000 crowns.

951
01:05:58,951 --> 01:06:00,410
Begging your pardon, sire.

952
01:06:00,494 --> 01:06:03,911
It won't do no good
how much you raise it.

953
01:06:03,995 --> 01:06:05,911
Really, scribe?
And why is that?

954
01:06:05,995 --> 01:06:08,412
Because, sire,
the poor, you see?

955
01:06:08,494 --> 01:06:10,911
He gives them
what he takes...

956
01:06:10,995 --> 01:06:13,829
and, well, sire,
they love him.

957
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:18,330
Just a minute.

958
01:06:18,371 --> 01:06:21,746
Robin Hood steals money
from my pocket...

959
01:06:21,830 --> 01:06:24,246
forcing me
to hurt the public...

960
01:06:24,328 --> 01:06:26,788
and they love him for it?

961
01:06:28,246 --> 01:06:29,498
Yes.

962
01:06:30,830 --> 01:06:32,663
That's it, then!

963
01:06:32,746 --> 01:06:35,621
Cancel the kitchen scraps
for lepers and orphans...

964
01:06:35,664 --> 01:06:38,497
no more
merciful beheadings...

965
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:41,331
and call off Christmas.

966
01:06:42,499 --> 01:06:43,999
The treasury is empty.

967
01:06:44,082 --> 01:06:46,999
All day and all night,
people plague my door...

968
01:06:47,082 --> 01:06:48,499
whining for tax relief...

969
01:06:48,584 --> 01:06:50,999
and safe passage
through Sherwood Forest.

970
01:06:51,083 --> 01:06:52,499
"We cannot pay thee...

971
01:06:52,582 --> 01:06:53,999
what the highwayman
has taken. "

972
01:06:54,083 --> 01:06:55,999
It's the shortest route
to London.

973
01:06:56,082 --> 01:07:00,084
It's the only road to London,
you little ferret.

974
01:07:00,166 --> 01:07:03,084
Sir Guy's patrols
have found nothing, sire.

975
01:07:03,167 --> 01:07:05,084
No camp. Nothing.

976
01:07:06,418 --> 01:07:11,460
This hooded viper
simply slithers into the forest.

977
01:07:11,543 --> 01:07:14,128
You, my room,
10:30 tonight.

978
01:07:14,168 --> 01:07:16,086
You, 10:45...

979
01:07:16,168 --> 01:07:17,835
and bring a friend.

980
01:07:35,795 --> 01:07:37,671
A tongue offends thee.

981
01:07:38,795 --> 01:07:39,796
Whose?

982
01:07:39,838 --> 01:07:41,671
One who rights all.

983
01:07:42,672 --> 01:07:45,547
One who...

984
01:07:45,631 --> 01:07:47,671
That horrible little scribe?

985
01:07:47,754 --> 01:07:49,838
- His tongue?
- Cut it out.

986
01:07:59,131 --> 01:08:00,923
# What's the pleasure
in this life #

987
01:08:01,006 --> 01:08:03,090
# Laughter, love,
and drinking #

988
01:08:03,173 --> 01:08:04,841
# Good King Richard,
bless his soul #

989
01:08:04,924 --> 01:08:06,756
# Loves his wine
and warring #

990
01:08:06,841 --> 01:08:08,715
# But for us
who stay at home #

991
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:11,008
# There's only beer
and whoring #

992
01:08:11,092 --> 01:08:12,799
# Play your music,
dance the day #

993
01:08:12,841 --> 01:08:14,884
# Think of not
tomorrow... #

994
01:08:19,258 --> 01:08:20,550
How many?

995
01:08:20,632 --> 01:08:22,092
20.

996
01:08:22,175 --> 01:08:23,466
20?

997
01:08:23,508 --> 01:08:25,426
How many?

998
01:08:26,926 --> 01:08:28,093
Five.

999
01:08:29,676 --> 01:08:31,509
They can't count anyway.

1000
01:08:31,551 --> 01:08:33,885
- Come on.
- Why scare them?

1001
01:08:33,969 --> 01:08:36,843
And they call me barbarian.

1002
01:08:36,885 --> 01:08:38,677
# Loves his wine
and warring #

1003
01:08:38,761 --> 01:08:40,510
# But for us
who stay at home #

1004
01:08:40,595 --> 01:08:43,012
# There's only beer
and whoring #

1005
01:08:43,094 --> 01:08:45,844
# Play the music,
dance the day... ##

1006
01:08:45,886 --> 01:08:48,344
Friar! You'll find
it difficult to sing...

1007
01:08:48,427 --> 01:08:51,344
with a sword
in your gullet.

1008
01:08:51,835 --> 01:08:53,751
Yes, my lord.

1009
01:08:55,377 --> 01:08:56,544
You pig.

1010
01:08:56,586 --> 01:08:58,086
Shut up about it!

1011
01:08:58,127 --> 01:08:59,587
Help me move this log!

1012
01:08:59,628 --> 01:09:00,919
Log? This is a tree!

1013
01:09:01,003 --> 01:09:02,421
You're supposed to help me!

1014
01:09:02,461 --> 01:09:04,920
I'm supposed to be
meeting a girl!

1015
01:09:11,629 --> 01:09:13,588
You men in front, after me.

1016
01:09:13,629 --> 01:09:17,254
You men in the rear,
stay with the wagon!

1017
01:09:18,546 --> 01:09:20,087
On to glory!

1018
01:09:20,170 --> 01:09:23,213
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1019
01:09:34,423 --> 01:09:36,631
Bastards!
Come on, find them!

1020
01:09:47,508 --> 01:09:49,216
# Oh... ##

1021
01:10:10,758 --> 01:10:12,051
Go!

1022
01:10:12,093 --> 01:10:14,635
Hyah!

1023
01:10:21,802 --> 01:10:24,095
Welcome to Sherwood,
Friar. Giddyup!

1024
01:10:45,930 --> 01:10:47,097
Aagh!

1025
01:10:48,972 --> 01:10:53,390
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Surrender your weapons!

1026
01:10:53,431 --> 01:10:55,431
Surrender your weapons
and I'll give you my word...

1027
01:10:55,515 --> 01:10:57,389
you shall go free!

1028
01:10:57,432 --> 01:10:58,639
Don't do that!

1029
01:11:00,766 --> 01:11:02,266
Aah! What are you...

1030
01:11:03,099 --> 01:11:05,890
Azeem! Aah!

1031
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:19,933
Look at that!
Oh!

1032
01:11:20,017 --> 01:11:22,517
I'll be buggered.

1033
01:11:22,601 --> 01:11:24,517
This treasure had a purpose.

1034
01:11:24,601 --> 01:11:26,518
We must find out what.

1035
01:11:26,602 --> 01:11:28,518
Oh! Aah!

1036
01:11:41,352 --> 01:11:43,770
Good morning,
my reverend friend.

1037
01:11:43,811 --> 01:11:45,770
You travel
with poor company...

1038
01:11:45,811 --> 01:11:48,771
when you travel with
Nottingham soldiers.

1039
01:11:48,811 --> 01:11:50,437
Tax him!

1040
01:11:50,519 --> 01:11:52,603
- Tax him!
- Tax him!

1041
01:11:52,687 --> 01:11:54,104
I'm Robin of Locksley...

1042
01:11:54,188 --> 01:11:56,729
and my men are thirsty.

1043
01:11:56,772 --> 01:11:58,521
- Aye!
- That's right.

1044
01:11:58,604 --> 01:11:59,730
Robin Hood!

1045
01:11:59,814 --> 01:12:04,645
Ha! Lord bless me.

1046
01:12:04,730 --> 01:12:07,938
I mistook you
for common thieves.

1047
01:12:08,021 --> 01:12:09,938
Kindly let me pass, huh?

1048
01:12:10,022 --> 01:12:12,439
Surely the lord
has the charity...

1049
01:12:12,523 --> 01:12:14,898
to spare a few barrels...

1050
01:12:14,939 --> 01:12:16,647
for good Christian men, yes?

1051
01:12:16,732 --> 01:12:18,565
We have much to celebrate.

1052
01:12:18,606 --> 01:12:20,190
Come on.

1053
01:12:20,274 --> 01:12:24,440
If you wish them to share
in the good lord's brew...

1054
01:12:24,482 --> 01:12:26,483
you must best me for it!

1055
01:12:26,566 --> 01:12:27,775
Hyah!

1056
01:12:32,441 --> 01:12:33,858
Confess, Robin Hood...

1057
01:12:33,941 --> 01:12:37,858
that Friar Tuck is a braver,
holier, and wiser man...

1058
01:12:37,941 --> 01:12:40,275
than thou art.

1059
01:12:56,362 --> 01:13:00,151
He giveth
and he taketh away.

1060
01:13:04,779 --> 01:13:06,235
Do you yield?

1061
01:13:10,779 --> 01:13:13,362
I'd rather roast in hell.

1062
01:13:13,445 --> 01:13:14,820
Aah!

1063
01:13:16,113 --> 01:13:17,863
Shoot him! Shoot him!

1064
01:13:19,571 --> 01:13:21,198
# Robin has his way #

1065
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,530
# Whether you live
by night or day #

1066
01:13:23,615 --> 01:13:25,947
# Whether you're rich
or young or old #

1067
01:13:25,989 --> 01:13:27,988
# Whether you're noble,
meek, or bold #

1068
01:13:28,072 --> 01:13:30,530
# You will fall #

1069
01:13:30,614 --> 01:13:32,697
# Short or tall ##

1070
01:13:35,615 --> 01:13:37,822
Oh, I think the good friar's
taken us far enough.

1071
01:13:37,906 --> 01:13:39,158
Well done, Friar.

1072
01:13:39,239 --> 01:13:43,031
Thank you, Lord,
for teaching me humility.

1073
01:13:43,114 --> 01:13:45,075
Ohh.

1074
01:13:51,449 --> 01:13:52,742
Well, Tuck...

1075
01:13:52,784 --> 01:13:54,200
Thanks for the beer.

1076
01:13:54,282 --> 01:13:57,200
Are these not
the meek of the earth?

1077
01:13:57,282 --> 01:14:01,242
We're in need of an honest man
to minister to them.

1078
01:14:01,326 --> 01:14:02,824
What say you, Friar?

1079
01:14:06,785 --> 01:14:10,203
The Lord reveals himself
in mysterious ways.

1080
01:14:12,452 --> 01:14:13,576
I accept.

1081
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:14,702
Good.

1082
01:14:14,785 --> 01:14:16,994
You will not regret it.

1083
01:14:17,077 --> 01:14:19,244
Aye, but you may!

1084
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,956
We were ambushed, cousin.

1085
01:14:58,539 --> 01:14:59,790
Spanish steel.

1086
01:14:59,872 --> 01:15:02,957
Much stronger than
our native blades.

1087
01:15:05,541 --> 01:15:07,666
Ahem. Any losses?

1088
01:15:07,706 --> 01:15:08,791
Some.

1089
01:15:12,542 --> 01:15:15,958
In truth, all of them.

1090
01:15:16,042 --> 01:15:17,459
And the gold?

1091
01:15:17,543 --> 01:15:18,459
Taken.

1092
01:15:20,542 --> 01:15:21,958
Robin Hood?

1093
01:15:22,041 --> 01:15:24,959
They were woodsmen,
cousin.

1094
01:15:28,543 --> 01:15:29,667
Robin Hood.

1095
01:15:31,043 --> 01:15:34,961
I tried.

1096
01:15:35,043 --> 01:15:36,085
Cousin.

1097
01:15:36,168 --> 01:15:38,460
I tried. I tried.

1098
01:15:38,545 --> 01:15:40,962
Cousin, we must be strong.

1099
01:15:41,044 --> 01:15:44,961
We can't allow an outlaw
to make fools of us.

1100
01:15:45,045 --> 01:15:48,128
And I can't allow
a lieutenant...

1101
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:50,710
to fail me.

1102
01:15:50,795 --> 01:15:53,087
Uhh!

1103
01:16:03,879 --> 01:16:06,797
Well, at least
I didn't use a spoon.

1104
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:07,963
Ha ha.

1105
01:16:10,047 --> 01:16:11,674
It's good steel.

1106
01:16:21,590 --> 01:16:22,633
Much!

1107
01:16:22,715 --> 01:16:23,675
What?

1108
01:16:23,758 --> 01:16:24,924
Take the left one.

1109
01:16:25,007 --> 01:16:27,882
Which one's left?

1110
01:16:27,925 --> 01:16:29,758
Which one you taking?

1111
01:16:29,841 --> 01:16:31,883
What do you mean?

1112
01:16:31,968 --> 01:16:34,425
If you're taking the left,
I'm taking the right.

1113
01:16:34,510 --> 01:16:36,384
Which one's on the right?

1114
01:16:36,426 --> 01:16:38,634
The one next to...

1115
01:16:38,717 --> 01:16:42,140
Bollocks, we'll just
jump out and grab them.

1116
01:16:42,852 --> 01:16:44,392
- Now?
- Now!

1117
01:16:47,392 --> 01:16:48,685
A donation if you please.

1118
01:16:48,727 --> 01:16:51,727
Donation?
For what?

1119
01:16:52,769 --> 01:16:55,312
Bull?

1120
01:16:55,394 --> 01:16:57,020
Uh, for passage
through Sherwood.

1121
01:16:57,061 --> 01:16:58,769
Very well.

1122
01:16:59,812 --> 01:17:00,687
Come get it.

1123
01:17:00,728 --> 01:17:01,978
Huh?

1124
01:17:06,647 --> 01:17:08,481
You stunted shrub.

1125
01:17:08,562 --> 01:17:10,313
How dare you attack us?

1126
01:17:10,396 --> 01:17:12,020
It's me job, milady.

1127
01:17:12,105 --> 01:17:14,146
And who is your employer?

1128
01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:16,270
Robin Hood.

1129
01:17:18,772 --> 01:17:21,189
I insist on seeing him at once.

1130
01:17:22,856 --> 01:17:23,980
No!

1131
01:17:24,063 --> 01:17:25,981
I'm trying to stop her, Bull!

1132
01:17:26,064 --> 01:17:27,981
You cannot go down there!

1133
01:17:28,065 --> 01:17:29,315
Will you stop?

1134
01:17:29,398 --> 01:17:30,648
Don't rush.
You'll fall.

1135
01:17:30,731 --> 01:17:31,982
He's not expecting you!

1136
01:17:32,066 --> 01:17:34,483
My lady's intrusion
is simply tit for tat.

1137
01:17:34,565 --> 01:17:36,941
Out of the way,
you old traps!

1138
01:17:37,025 --> 01:17:38,983
You can't go down there!

1139
01:17:39,066 --> 01:17:40,148
Oh.

1140
01:17:40,233 --> 01:17:42,148
I told you,
not down there!

1141
01:17:42,233 --> 01:17:44,857
You've already had
the rough part of my hand.

1142
01:17:44,941 --> 01:17:46,483
You'll get it again.

1143
01:17:46,566 --> 01:17:47,983
Ooh! Oh, I say!

1144
01:17:48,066 --> 01:17:49,482
Cover your eyes.

1145
01:17:49,566 --> 01:17:51,483
Milady, don't.

1146
01:18:02,402 --> 01:18:04,485
You could have said.

1147
01:18:07,568 --> 01:18:08,777
Robin!

1148
01:18:08,859 --> 01:18:10,443
You got visitors!

1149
01:18:14,653 --> 01:18:17,694
Don't look at me like that.
It weren't my fault.

1150
01:18:17,735 --> 01:18:18,986
It was Much!

1151
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:20,487
It weren't me!

1152
01:18:20,568 --> 01:18:23,029
Be careful.
It's slippery there.

1153
01:18:25,946 --> 01:18:27,071
Hello.

1154
01:18:28,571 --> 01:18:30,446
Well, what are you
doing here?

1155
01:18:34,571 --> 01:18:36,696
Taking a lady's advice.

1156
01:18:38,071 --> 01:18:41,197
What happened
to your eye, Bull?

1157
01:18:41,279 --> 01:18:42,489
It was set upon
by 10...

1158
01:18:42,573 --> 01:18:43,488
12!

1159
01:18:43,572 --> 01:18:44,990
15 large, big lads.

1160
01:18:45,072 --> 01:18:47,115
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1161
01:19:00,075 --> 01:19:01,492
You've been busy.

1162
01:19:01,574 --> 01:19:03,991
Ha ha ha!
We have guests!

1163
01:19:04,075 --> 01:19:05,492
Bring them down!

1164
01:19:17,074 --> 01:19:17,992
It works.

1165
01:19:19,410 --> 01:19:21,493
Kind of.

1166
01:19:21,577 --> 01:19:23,368
Of course it works.

1167
01:19:24,576 --> 01:19:25,993
Great shot!
A beauty!

1168
01:19:26,077 --> 01:19:29,703
All right, Wulf,
take your time, now.

1169
01:19:29,786 --> 01:19:31,995
- Yeah!
- All right!

1170
01:19:33,285 --> 01:19:34,828
That's good, Wulf...

1171
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:37,828
but can you do it
amidst distraction?

1172
01:19:37,911 --> 01:19:40,828
Can you make the shot
when you must?

1173
01:19:43,079 --> 01:19:44,246
Show him, Wulf.

1174
01:19:44,329 --> 01:19:46,871
- Go on.
- You can do it.

1175
01:19:51,413 --> 01:19:53,497
- Oh!
- Hey!

1176
01:19:53,579 --> 01:19:54,664
Can you?

1177
01:19:54,746 --> 01:19:57,498
Well, go on, Robin.

1178
01:19:57,580 --> 01:19:59,706
It was a dirty trick.

1179
01:19:59,789 --> 01:20:01,497
Oh, he's serious.

1180
01:20:01,580 --> 01:20:03,914
Is his shirt
coming off at all?

1181
01:20:03,997 --> 01:20:05,497
Ha ha ha!

1182
01:20:26,083 --> 01:20:28,250
Well done.
Well done.

1183
01:20:29,582 --> 01:20:32,166
This is grain...

1184
01:20:32,251 --> 01:20:33,500
which any fool can eat...

1185
01:20:33,583 --> 01:20:36,001
but for which
the Lord intended...

1186
01:20:36,083 --> 01:20:39,001
a more divine means
of consumption.

1187
01:20:39,083 --> 01:20:41,501
Let us give praise
to our maker...

1188
01:20:41,584 --> 01:20:43,502
and glory to his bounty...

1189
01:20:43,586 --> 01:20:45,502
by learning about...

1190
01:20:45,585 --> 01:20:46,502
beer.

1191
01:20:46,586 --> 01:20:48,002
- Ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

1192
01:20:54,086 --> 01:20:56,503
Did you bring me
here to brag?

1193
01:20:59,794 --> 01:21:01,836
This is blood money, Marian.

1194
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,004
It's intended to bribe
King Richard's enemies...

1195
01:21:04,087 --> 01:21:05,753
to unite against him.

1196
01:21:05,837 --> 01:21:08,129
We intercepted it.

1197
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:11,088
But who would...

1198
01:21:11,170 --> 01:21:12,713
Nottingham.

1199
01:21:12,797 --> 01:21:16,088
No. Nottingham would not dare
challenge the king.

1200
01:21:16,129 --> 01:21:17,882
The king is not in England.

1201
01:21:17,922 --> 01:21:21,880
While he's away,
he may lose his country.

1202
01:21:24,549 --> 01:21:25,798
You thought...

1203
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:29,756
You thought I was
keeping it all, didn't you?

1204
01:21:29,839 --> 01:21:30,964
Didn't you?

1205
01:21:33,507 --> 01:21:34,506
Well, here...

1206
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:36,131
A contribution to your cause.

1207
01:21:36,215 --> 01:21:37,300
Keep it.

1208
01:21:37,382 --> 01:21:40,049
No. This dagger
would fetch a great price.

1209
01:21:40,091 --> 01:21:41,632
No! It's not
dear to me...

1210
01:21:41,716 --> 01:21:44,258
I mean, it...

1211
01:21:44,341 --> 01:21:45,383
it's not.

1212
01:21:45,425 --> 01:21:47,884
Oh, I'm saying
everything wrong.

1213
01:21:48,968 --> 01:21:50,301
Um...

1214
01:21:50,384 --> 01:21:51,467
cheers.

1215
01:21:57,884 --> 01:22:00,135
How do I get down?

1216
01:22:04,885 --> 01:22:05,802
Wait, wait.

1217
01:22:05,886 --> 01:22:06,801
Oh.

1218
01:22:08,886 --> 01:22:11,303
We don't go that way anymore.

1219
01:22:11,386 --> 01:22:13,136
I'm happy to hear that.

1220
01:22:13,219 --> 01:22:14,137
Grab on.

1221
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:15,135
Mm-hmm.

1222
01:22:16,679 --> 01:22:17,720
Ooh!

1223
01:22:17,803 --> 01:22:19,261
We have a rule here.

1224
01:22:19,304 --> 01:22:22,136
Once someone has seen
the way to our camp...

1225
01:22:22,219 --> 01:22:24,094
that person cannot leave.

1226
01:22:24,178 --> 01:22:27,303
There's too many lives at stake.

1227
01:22:27,387 --> 01:22:30,805
That's why Sarah and I
asked to be blindfolded.

1228
01:22:30,888 --> 01:22:31,803
Oh.

1229
01:22:33,387 --> 01:22:37,306
Well, perhaps
you might join us for dinner.

1230
01:22:37,388 --> 01:22:38,763
Perhaps.

1231
01:22:56,890 --> 01:22:58,265
Salaam, little one.

1232
01:22:58,348 --> 01:23:00,141
Did God paint you?

1233
01:23:00,222 --> 01:23:01,975
Did God paint me?

1234
01:23:05,225 --> 01:23:06,225
For certain.

1235
01:23:06,267 --> 01:23:08,101
Why?

1236
01:23:09,892 --> 01:23:12,142
Because...

1237
01:23:12,225 --> 01:23:14,642
Allah loves
wondrous variety.

1238
01:23:16,477 --> 01:23:20,934
You see, that is why
your hair is brown.

1239
01:23:22,642 --> 01:23:26,393
Keep thy heathen words away
from ears of this innocent...

1240
01:23:26,435 --> 01:23:28,393
or you'll answer me.

1241
01:23:28,435 --> 01:23:31,268
You know nothing of our god.

1242
01:23:33,352 --> 01:23:37,935
Is not Allah the god of Abraham
as is your god?

1243
01:23:38,020 --> 01:23:40,936
Don't trick me with twist
of the devil's tongue!

1244
01:23:40,979 --> 01:23:42,812
Come! Come!

1245
01:23:48,978 --> 01:23:52,813
How is it that a once arrogant
young nobleman...

1246
01:23:52,896 --> 01:23:55,396
has found contentment
living rough...

1247
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:57,271
with the salt of the earth?

1248
01:23:57,313 --> 01:23:59,272
I've seen
armored knights panic...

1249
01:23:59,313 --> 01:24:02,272
at the first hint of battle...

1250
01:24:02,313 --> 01:24:04,774
and I've seen the lowliest,
unarmed squire...

1251
01:24:04,814 --> 01:24:07,773
pull a spear
from his own body...

1252
01:24:07,856 --> 01:24:10,107
to defend a dying horse.

1253
01:24:10,191 --> 01:24:13,148
Nobility's not a birthright.

1254
01:24:13,232 --> 01:24:16,898
It's defined
by one's actions.

1255
01:24:16,938 --> 01:24:20,149
It's interesting
to hear you say that.

1256
01:24:20,231 --> 01:24:23,900
I didn't.
My father did.

1257
01:24:28,274 --> 01:24:32,401
Did the holy quest
erase your hatred of him?

1258
01:24:32,483 --> 01:24:36,442
I don't know.
All I know is...

1259
01:24:36,484 --> 01:24:38,776
that our last words
in this world were...

1260
01:24:38,859 --> 01:24:40,652
spoken in anger.

1261
01:24:40,735 --> 01:24:43,151
I was lost
after my mother died.

1262
01:24:43,234 --> 01:24:44,650
My father, too.

1263
01:24:44,734 --> 01:24:47,650
And for a short time,
he found comfort...

1264
01:24:47,735 --> 01:24:50,985
in the arms of another woman,
a peasant woman.

1265
01:24:53,610 --> 01:24:55,903
I thought he was betraying
my mother's memory.

1266
01:24:55,943 --> 01:24:57,402
So he gave her up?

1267
01:24:58,818 --> 01:25:01,279
For the love
of a 12-year-old boy...

1268
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:03,279
who would never
forgive him.

1269
01:25:09,821 --> 01:25:11,779
Anyway, who...

1270
01:25:11,821 --> 01:25:13,571
who says I'm content?

1271
01:25:13,612 --> 01:25:17,738
I have my plans for the future.

1272
01:25:17,822 --> 01:25:20,781
No, a grander scheme
than this?

1273
01:25:20,822 --> 01:25:23,780
No. A simpler one.

1274
01:25:23,822 --> 01:25:27,113
A home, family...

1275
01:25:27,156 --> 01:25:28,239
love.

1276
01:25:28,323 --> 01:25:30,782
Oh, men speak
conveniently of love...

1277
01:25:30,823 --> 01:25:32,782
when it serves their purpose.

1278
01:25:32,822 --> 01:25:34,239
And when it doesn't...

1279
01:25:34,282 --> 01:25:36,282
'tis a burden to them.

1280
01:25:36,324 --> 01:25:39,282
Robin of the Hood,
prince of thieves...

1281
01:25:41,031 --> 01:25:43,074
is he capable of love?

1282
01:25:47,492 --> 01:25:52,908
Father!

1283
01:25:52,991 --> 01:25:54,950
It's mother.
She's dying.

1284
01:25:55,033 --> 01:25:56,618
Oh, God!

1285
01:25:56,701 --> 01:25:57,785
Aah!

1286
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:01,451
Aah!

1287
01:26:03,743 --> 01:26:07,452
Fanny, your baby
has not turned.

1288
01:26:09,326 --> 01:26:11,619
It cannot be born
without help.

1289
01:26:11,662 --> 01:26:12,619
Uhh!

1290
01:26:12,661 --> 01:26:14,411
He is the devil's seed...

1291
01:26:14,453 --> 01:26:15,953
sent to lead us astray.

1292
01:26:16,036 --> 01:26:18,453
Don't listen to him.
He will kill her!

1293
01:26:18,536 --> 01:26:20,079
If you do not
listen to me...

1294
01:26:20,163 --> 01:26:22,662
she will certainly
die... and the child.

1295
01:26:22,745 --> 01:26:24,828
No!

1296
01:26:24,913 --> 01:26:26,411
Aah!

1297
01:26:26,453 --> 01:26:28,954
The good friar's
done all he can.

1298
01:26:29,038 --> 01:26:32,288
I suggest you let
the Moor try.

1299
01:26:33,956 --> 01:26:35,622
Ohh!

1300
01:26:35,706 --> 01:26:37,081
So be it.

1301
01:26:37,121 --> 01:26:40,621
Then be it on your head.
I've warned you.

1302
01:26:40,704 --> 01:26:41,664
Marian.

1303
01:26:41,747 --> 01:26:42,956
Yes?

1304
01:26:43,038 --> 01:26:44,956
Get me needle,
thread, water.

1305
01:26:44,998 --> 01:26:46,039
And hurry.

1306
01:26:46,121 --> 01:26:47,039
Yes.

1307
01:26:47,122 --> 01:26:49,039
Come with me.
Come, John.

1308
01:26:49,121 --> 01:26:50,540
Ohh!

1309
01:26:50,623 --> 01:26:52,915
What are you going to do?

1310
01:26:55,123 --> 01:26:58,207
I have seen it
many times...

1311
01:26:58,291 --> 01:26:59,916
with horses.

1312
01:27:01,625 --> 01:27:03,416
With horses?

1313
01:27:05,415 --> 01:27:06,999
Bite down, bite down.

1314
01:27:07,083 --> 01:27:08,625
Yes.

1315
01:27:08,707 --> 01:27:09,791
Ohh!

1316
01:27:09,875 --> 01:27:11,791
Help me, Sadiq.

1317
01:27:14,625 --> 01:27:16,417
Give me your arms.

1318
01:27:17,626 --> 01:27:20,460
It will be all right.

1319
01:27:25,961 --> 01:27:28,335
Aah!

1320
01:27:28,418 --> 01:27:32,002
I tell you, John, the barbarian
is killing her.

1321
01:27:32,087 --> 01:27:36,794
No!

1322
01:27:36,878 --> 01:27:38,295
No, Father, no!

1323
01:27:38,378 --> 01:27:39,627
Out of the way, boy.

1324
01:27:41,045 --> 01:27:42,545
Quick, take him,
take him.

1325
01:27:46,128 --> 01:27:48,295
Oh...

1326
01:27:48,379 --> 01:27:50,463
ooh, what is it?

1327
01:27:59,297 --> 01:28:02,797
Your son, milady.
There you are.

1328
01:28:12,549 --> 01:28:15,257
You truly are a great one.

1329
01:28:17,590 --> 01:28:19,298
My son!

1330
01:28:20,633 --> 01:28:22,550
Look at that
lovely little baby.

1331
01:28:22,632 --> 01:28:24,050
Isn't he wonderful?

1332
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:25,258
- Yay!
- Yay!

1333
01:28:25,342 --> 01:28:27,301
John, he's beautiful!

1334
01:28:33,842 --> 01:28:36,799
Today the Lord has taught me
a fine lesson.

1335
01:28:36,842 --> 01:28:39,300
And though I may
think I am godly...

1336
01:28:39,343 --> 01:28:41,302
I know I am not worldly.

1337
01:28:41,343 --> 01:28:43,467
Please, please.

1338
01:28:46,261 --> 01:28:47,302
Ha!

1339
01:28:47,386 --> 01:28:48,803
Come, my barbarian friend...

1340
01:28:48,886 --> 01:28:51,303
so you and I open
a barrel together...

1341
01:28:51,385 --> 01:28:53,218
and save each other's souls.

1342
01:28:53,302 --> 01:28:54,719
Alas, I am not permitted.

1343
01:28:54,803 --> 01:28:57,261
Well, fine, then.
You talk, I'll drink.

1344
01:29:01,303 --> 01:29:02,719
Well!

1345
01:29:04,470 --> 01:29:06,138
Milady!

1346
01:29:06,220 --> 01:29:07,469
Sarah!

1347
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:11,805
May I have this dance?

1348
01:29:11,847 --> 01:29:12,804
Oh!

1349
01:29:12,846 --> 01:29:14,305
This lady is spoken for.

1350
01:29:57,017 --> 01:29:58,476
Why this way?

1351
01:29:58,517 --> 01:30:01,435
So you cannot
find the way back...

1352
01:30:01,475 --> 01:30:04,434
or be forced to tell
others the way.

1353
01:30:07,060 --> 01:30:10,269
It was good to see
you again, Marian.

1354
01:30:10,353 --> 01:30:13,103
It was good to be seen.

1355
01:30:14,603 --> 01:30:18,687
I have two favors to ask of you.

1356
01:30:18,770 --> 01:30:21,937
- One.
- Take Duncan with you.

1357
01:30:21,978 --> 01:30:25,438
I fear for his health
with what may lie ahead.

1358
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:28,770
Besides, I grow tired
of his bellyaching.

1359
01:30:28,812 --> 01:30:31,271
You wish me to leave,
Master Robin?

1360
01:30:31,312 --> 01:30:33,312
Old friend,
listen to me.

1361
01:30:33,396 --> 01:30:36,396
Can you take Lady Marian
safely home?

1362
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:38,938
I fear for her safety.

1363
01:30:38,981 --> 01:30:40,731
Of course, sire.

1364
01:30:40,814 --> 01:30:41,772
Good.

1365
01:30:41,814 --> 01:30:43,313
Bull.

1366
01:30:49,939 --> 01:30:51,315
And two?

1367
01:30:51,398 --> 01:30:53,606
Yes, two.

1368
01:30:56,107 --> 01:30:58,357
You're King Richard's cousin.

1369
01:30:59,607 --> 01:31:01,774
You can get word to him...

1370
01:31:01,815 --> 01:31:04,357
of Nottingham's plan.

1371
01:31:04,442 --> 01:31:05,858
He would believe you.

1372
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:10,191
If the sheriff found out,
I could lose all that I have.

1373
01:31:11,442 --> 01:31:13,651
That's true...

1374
01:31:13,735 --> 01:31:16,775
but will you
do it for your king?

1375
01:31:17,817 --> 01:31:19,276
No.

1376
01:31:22,151 --> 01:31:24,776
I'll do it for you.

1377
01:31:43,486 --> 01:31:46,070
He fancies you, my lady.

1378
01:31:48,112 --> 01:31:52,030
I am blind, but some things
I can still see.

1379
01:32:10,823 --> 01:32:14,281
In 10 days' time,
the barons are coming.

1380
01:32:14,365 --> 01:32:17,614
Robin Hood has stolen what I was
to pay for their allegiance...

1381
01:32:17,657 --> 01:32:22,197
and I am surrounded by fools
who do not realize my obligations.

1382
01:32:23,157 --> 01:32:25,449
Tell me, Mortianna...

1383
01:32:26,449 --> 01:32:27,990
am I thwarted?

1384
01:32:35,492 --> 01:32:37,618
Aah.

1385
01:32:50,909 --> 01:32:53,119
Recruit the beasts
that share our god.

1386
01:32:55,620 --> 01:32:57,786
- Animals?
- From the north.

1387
01:32:57,870 --> 01:33:00,621
You mean Celts.

1388
01:33:00,704 --> 01:33:03,162
They drink the blood
of their dead.

1389
01:33:03,203 --> 01:33:05,495
Yoke their strengths.

1390
01:33:08,370 --> 01:33:11,454
Hired thugs.

1391
01:33:12,787 --> 01:33:16,705
Ahh. Brilliant.

1392
01:33:19,496 --> 01:33:23,456
Put thine own issue
on the throne.

1393
01:33:24,580 --> 01:33:27,831
- A child? How?
- Alive with royal blood.

1394
01:33:30,497 --> 01:33:32,623
Who?

1395
01:33:47,457 --> 01:33:48,957
It's a personal
matter, my lord...

1396
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,626
but one of vital
importance.

1397
01:33:50,707 --> 01:33:53,167
I understand,
my dear lady.

1398
01:33:53,208 --> 01:33:56,542
This is my most
trusted emissary.

1399
01:33:56,626 --> 01:33:58,543
He must travel
to France immediately...

1400
01:33:58,626 --> 01:34:00,668
and put that directly
into the hands of the king.

1401
01:34:00,752 --> 01:34:02,627
My lady-in-waiting
shall accompany you.

1402
01:34:02,667 --> 01:34:07,419
My dear, I could not
vouch for her safety.

1403
01:34:07,501 --> 01:34:09,334
The journey is fraught
with danger.

1404
01:34:09,376 --> 01:34:11,336
I appreciate your
concern, my lord...

1405
01:34:11,377 --> 01:34:13,293
but Sarah is an
accomplished rider.

1406
01:34:13,335 --> 01:34:15,502
I insist that she go along.

1407
01:34:15,586 --> 01:34:17,377
As you wish.

1408
01:34:30,504 --> 01:34:32,629
What is wrong?

1409
01:34:32,670 --> 01:34:35,671
My horse is favoring
his foreleg.

1410
01:35:25,052 --> 01:35:27,302
What's this?

1411
01:35:29,385 --> 01:35:30,636
An appetizer.

1412
01:35:30,719 --> 01:35:35,259
You promised us
wagons of gold.

1413
01:35:35,344 --> 01:35:39,011
Well, there are
greater things than gold.

1414
01:35:39,094 --> 01:35:42,803
More land and power
than you've ever dreamed of.

1415
01:35:44,553 --> 01:35:46,845
When I rule this land...

1416
01:35:46,930 --> 01:35:50,679
it'll be divided between
just the seven of us in this room.

1417
01:35:50,763 --> 01:35:53,305
You get Cornwall,
you can have Wales...

1418
01:35:53,347 --> 01:35:55,555
and Scotland is all yours.

1419
01:35:56,763 --> 01:35:58,972
You recruit us to treason...

1420
01:35:59,056 --> 01:36:02,180
and yet you cannot even get gold
through your own forest.

1421
01:36:02,262 --> 01:36:04,806
My lords,
why risk life and limb...

1422
01:36:04,889 --> 01:36:06,806
for a man who can't even snare
the paltry bandit...

1423
01:36:06,847 --> 01:36:10,474
- who marked his pretty face?
- Why, indeed.

1424
01:36:11,555 --> 01:36:13,640
Good point, milord.

1425
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:15,807
How can I control England...

1426
01:36:15,891 --> 01:36:18,849
when I cannot even control
my own county?

1427
01:36:19,724 --> 01:36:22,057
I bring in a little help.

1428
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:24,518
Udrid!

1429
01:36:30,058 --> 01:36:32,475
By God.

1430
01:36:32,517 --> 01:36:34,517
You're to lie us
with the Celts?

1431
01:36:34,558 --> 01:36:38,643
What can these mercenaries
do that we cannot do?

1432
01:37:09,229 --> 01:37:11,687
Very impressive.

1433
01:37:11,770 --> 01:37:13,980
All right, milord sheriff...

1434
01:37:14,062 --> 01:37:18,647
but you must wed
royal kin before we act.

1435
01:37:18,730 --> 01:37:21,314
Then your claim
to the throne will be...

1436
01:37:23,189 --> 01:37:24,480
legitimate.

1437
01:37:24,522 --> 01:37:27,854
I'm as good as engaged.

1438
01:37:49,483 --> 01:37:51,984
Duncan, is that you?

1439
01:37:55,650 --> 01:37:57,235
Hello?

1440
01:38:01,650 --> 01:38:03,609
Rebecca.

1441
01:38:06,443 --> 01:38:08,360
Oh, God!

1442
01:38:08,443 --> 01:38:10,193
Nicodemus.

1443
01:38:10,276 --> 01:38:11,235
Go.

1444
01:38:11,319 --> 01:38:12,694
Find mice.

1445
01:38:12,778 --> 01:38:13,860
Ha ha!

1446
01:38:13,944 --> 01:38:15,736
Aah!

1447
01:38:15,819 --> 01:38:19,486
I've never seen the breasts
of a noblewoman.

1448
01:38:19,569 --> 01:38:22,486
Aah!

1449
01:38:24,194 --> 01:38:25,361
Back!

1450
01:38:31,071 --> 01:38:32,736
Oh, pardon, milady,
we couldn't hold him!

1451
01:38:32,821 --> 01:38:35,570
Someone wants
a word with you.

1452
01:38:36,905 --> 01:38:38,739
Aah!

1453
01:38:40,031 --> 01:38:41,990
Oh, no!

1454
01:38:42,030 --> 01:38:44,322
That's it, sir.
That's all of them.

1455
01:39:00,572 --> 01:39:02,783
Easy, easy.

1456
01:39:06,033 --> 01:39:10,409
Tonight I need your eyes,
old friend.

1457
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:56,497
Robin!

1458
01:39:56,580 --> 01:39:58,913
Someone is in our home!

1459
01:40:00,163 --> 01:40:03,162
All is well.
It's Duncan!

1460
01:40:12,206 --> 01:40:13,832
What happened?

1461
01:40:13,914 --> 01:40:16,914
I found you, Robin.
Thank God I did it.

1462
01:40:16,998 --> 01:40:18,958
Nottingham's men
attacked us.

1463
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:20,207
Marian?

1464
01:40:20,290 --> 01:40:23,957
They took her.

1465
01:40:24,041 --> 01:40:25,206
Ah...

1466
01:40:30,749 --> 01:40:32,833
What is it?

1467
01:40:34,791 --> 01:40:37,251
Over there! Look!

1468
01:40:37,335 --> 01:40:39,792
On the hill!

1469
01:40:50,625 --> 01:40:53,210
- Aah!
- Aah!

1470
01:40:59,503 --> 01:41:01,794
Celts. God help us.

1471
01:41:01,878 --> 01:41:03,920
Allah, be merciful.

1472
01:41:04,004 --> 01:41:08,129
To the trees!

1473
01:41:09,088 --> 01:41:11,088
Celts! They're coming!

1474
01:41:11,172 --> 01:41:13,588
Poor old fool
led them straight to us.

1475
01:41:19,045 --> 01:41:20,921
Get me prisoners.

1476
01:41:21,005 --> 01:41:23,047
Aah!

1477
01:41:23,130 --> 01:41:25,255
- Aah!
- Aah!

1478
01:41:33,590 --> 01:41:36,257
Children, come to me!

1479
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:38,049
Grab the children!

1480
01:41:44,132 --> 01:41:45,424
Ha ha ha!

1481
01:41:53,884 --> 01:41:56,176
Daddy! Save me!

1482
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:54,456
My God.

1483
01:44:03,747 --> 01:44:05,579
Aah!

1484
01:44:07,332 --> 01:44:08,866
Robin, save us!

1485
01:44:14,999 --> 01:44:16,831
Aah!

1486
01:44:17,832 --> 01:44:20,573
Aah! Aah!

1487
01:44:22,614 --> 01:44:23,575
Come!

1488
01:44:23,613 --> 01:44:24,576
Hurry!

1489
01:44:24,614 --> 01:44:26,030
Aah!

1490
01:44:26,081 --> 01:44:27,954
Save yourselves!

1491
01:44:31,448 --> 01:44:34,411
We better go, Robin!
We better go now!

1492
01:44:36,243 --> 01:44:37,868
Run!

1493
01:44:37,946 --> 01:44:39,908
Robin!

1494
01:44:46,028 --> 01:44:48,535
Aah!

1495
01:44:50,783 --> 01:44:52,861
This way, my lambs!
Come on!

1496
01:44:57,073 --> 01:44:58,398
Hold thy fire.

1497
01:45:02,777 --> 01:45:05,115
It's gold! Gold!
Look! It's gold!

1498
01:45:09,858 --> 01:45:10,988
Fanny!

1499
01:45:13,899 --> 01:45:14,899
Fanny!

1500
01:45:17,147 --> 01:45:18,863
John!

1501
01:45:18,940 --> 01:45:20,941
Come on, now!

1502
01:45:29,192 --> 01:45:30,947
Aah! No!

1503
01:45:44,109 --> 01:45:45,941
Aah!

1504
01:45:46,018 --> 01:45:48,397
Fanny!

1505
01:45:48,435 --> 01:45:50,398
Go! Save yourself, John!

1506
01:45:50,437 --> 01:45:53,893
No, Fanny!
I won't leave you!

1507
01:45:53,931 --> 01:45:55,686
Go on, John!

1508
01:45:55,764 --> 01:45:57,857
Never!

1509
01:46:00,104 --> 01:46:01,897
Oh, God!

1510
01:46:11,603 --> 01:46:13,344
Oh, thank God.

1511
01:46:16,061 --> 01:46:18,516
John, you'll have to
catch her!

1512
01:46:18,555 --> 01:46:20,218
Come on!

1513
01:46:20,311 --> 01:46:22,011
Aah!

1514
01:46:24,804 --> 01:46:27,429
No!

1515
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:29,678
I got you, girl!

1516
01:46:35,057 --> 01:46:36,227
You swine!
Come here!

1517
01:46:36,304 --> 01:46:37,643
Quick! Quick!

1518
01:46:37,721 --> 01:46:39,175
All right, now!

1519
01:46:47,088 --> 01:46:48,427
- Come on!
- Come on!

1520
01:46:53,806 --> 01:46:56,223
- Go on!
- Come on!

1521
01:46:56,301 --> 01:46:58,758
Don't wait for me!

1522
01:46:58,848 --> 01:47:00,797
John, go on!

1523
01:47:00,888 --> 01:47:01,797
Hurry!

1524
01:47:13,166 --> 01:47:15,636
Aah!

1525
01:47:30,046 --> 01:47:31,631
Corpus Christi.

1526
01:47:31,708 --> 01:47:32,632
Amen.

1527
01:47:51,382 --> 01:47:52,628
My lady Marian.

1528
01:47:54,708 --> 01:47:58,126
By what right do you
keep me prisoner?

1529
01:47:58,203 --> 01:48:01,296
You misunderstand
my intentions.

1530
01:48:01,374 --> 01:48:04,129
You've been brought here
for your own protection.

1531
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:07,455
Protection from whom?

1532
01:48:07,533 --> 01:48:09,118
From yourself.

1533
01:48:10,378 --> 01:48:13,952
It seems you've been
consorting with outlaws.

1534
01:48:14,042 --> 01:48:14,951
No.

1535
01:48:16,198 --> 01:48:18,446
Where do you hear
such lies?

1536
01:48:19,708 --> 01:48:21,956
By your own hand, my lady.

1537
01:48:27,698 --> 01:48:29,283
I'm sorry, my child.

1538
01:48:30,700 --> 01:48:33,623
I feared you were
being led astray.

1539
01:48:36,704 --> 01:48:37,613
Come.

1540
01:48:46,371 --> 01:48:48,449
It's over.

1541
01:48:49,658 --> 01:48:51,984
Today I return justice...

1542
01:48:52,036 --> 01:48:53,906
to this land.

1543
01:48:53,984 --> 01:48:56,402
I shall have to hang
the ringleaders, of course...

1544
01:48:56,492 --> 01:48:58,909
but I would like
to be generous...

1545
01:48:58,987 --> 01:49:00,910
and give you the lives...

1546
01:49:00,988 --> 01:49:03,574
of the woodsmen
and their families...

1547
01:49:03,651 --> 01:49:05,653
The children!

1548
01:49:06,992 --> 01:49:08,732
And, of course...

1549
01:49:08,823 --> 01:49:10,734
of your traitorous
lady-in-waiting...

1550
01:49:10,825 --> 01:49:12,318
Get in there!

1551
01:49:14,151 --> 01:49:15,905
as a wedding gift.

1552
01:49:20,985 --> 01:49:24,402
And just who am I
supposed to marry?

1553
01:49:30,314 --> 01:49:33,562
Search your heart, my child.

1554
01:49:33,653 --> 01:49:36,903
Why not a union with
the House of Nottingham...

1555
01:49:36,980 --> 01:49:39,644
and heal the wounds
in our land?

1556
01:49:39,682 --> 01:49:41,060
There's only one man...

1557
01:49:41,151 --> 01:49:44,232
who can heal the wounds
of this land... Robin Hood.

1558
01:49:56,808 --> 01:49:58,848
I'm truly sorry, my lady.

1559
01:49:58,939 --> 01:50:00,850
He wasted his life.

1560
01:50:00,940 --> 01:50:03,812
How many more lives
would you waste?

1561
01:50:14,648 --> 01:50:16,806
What a beautiful child.

1562
01:50:20,638 --> 01:50:21,886
So young...

1563
01:50:22,977 --> 01:50:24,018
so alive...

1564
01:50:24,096 --> 01:50:28,720
so unaware of
how precarious life can be.

1565
01:50:34,971 --> 01:50:36,895
I had a very sad childhood.

1566
01:50:36,972 --> 01:50:38,882
I'll tell you
about it sometime.

1567
01:50:38,973 --> 01:50:42,429
I never knew my parents.
It's amazing I'm sane.

1568
01:50:49,809 --> 01:50:51,174
Marian...

1569
01:50:52,473 --> 01:50:54,383
our bonding would
allow these children...

1570
01:50:54,475 --> 01:50:57,047
to grow up as my allies.

1571
01:50:57,138 --> 01:50:59,216
You understand...

1572
01:50:59,294 --> 01:51:03,089
I cannot allow them
to grow up as my enemies.

1573
01:51:06,299 --> 01:51:07,715
I have no choice.

1574
01:51:09,963 --> 01:51:11,093
That's true.

1575
01:51:22,293 --> 01:51:23,709
No.

1576
01:51:26,126 --> 01:51:27,881
No!

1577
01:51:51,334 --> 01:51:52,334
Look.

1578
01:51:58,454 --> 01:51:59,585
Christian.

1579
01:52:08,953 --> 01:52:10,786
Aah!

1580
01:52:34,655 --> 01:52:36,902
Sorry to keep you
hanging about.

1581
01:52:41,490 --> 01:52:45,945
Would you prefer
pain or death?

1582
01:52:47,193 --> 01:52:48,778
Death.

1583
01:52:48,870 --> 01:52:50,533
Torture him.

1584
01:52:52,027 --> 01:52:55,275
What about you,
pain or death?

1585
01:52:55,367 --> 01:52:57,822
Uh, pain!

1586
01:52:57,900 --> 01:52:59,485
Torture him.

1587
01:52:59,576 --> 01:53:01,487
You see, it makes
no difference.

1588
01:53:01,578 --> 01:53:03,449
Spare me!

1589
01:53:05,151 --> 01:53:07,775
Will you keep the noise
down, please?

1590
01:53:09,322 --> 01:53:11,439
Now I have heard...

1591
01:53:11,491 --> 01:53:13,986
that Robin Hood
may still be alive.

1592
01:53:16,233 --> 01:53:19,898
Either tell me
where he may be hiding...

1593
01:53:19,989 --> 01:53:21,939
or you'll all be hanged
and we'll catch him anyway...

1594
01:53:22,030 --> 01:53:23,862
and do the same thing
to him.

1595
01:53:23,939 --> 01:53:26,031
- I'd love to kill him for you.
- Will, no!

1596
01:53:30,189 --> 01:53:33,399
So he is alive then.

1597
01:53:33,477 --> 01:53:35,438
I'm not really sure.

1598
01:53:35,529 --> 01:53:39,312
Then why would I need you?

1599
01:53:39,402 --> 01:53:43,352
Because if he is alive,
I can get close to him.

1600
01:53:43,443 --> 01:53:45,691
I'm one of his men.
He would never suspect me.

1601
01:53:45,769 --> 01:53:47,900
- He knows you always hated him, traitor!
- Shut up!

1602
01:53:49,978 --> 01:53:51,902
He's a trusting fool.
He'll believe me.

1603
01:53:51,979 --> 01:53:55,189
If he doesn't, he'll kill me.
Then you've lost nothing.

1604
01:53:57,892 --> 01:54:01,023
If you fail...

1605
01:54:01,101 --> 01:54:05,349
I will personally remove
your lying tongue.

1606
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:09,976
And if I succeed...

1607
01:54:10,015 --> 01:54:14,095
I want my freedom
and the bounty on his head.

1608
01:54:14,186 --> 01:54:15,979
The lash, I think.

1609
01:54:16,057 --> 01:54:18,720
Sorry about that.
It'll make it more convincing.

1610
01:54:53,636 --> 01:54:55,350
My pride brought us to this.

1611
01:54:55,429 --> 01:54:57,260
No, Sadiq.

1612
01:54:57,338 --> 01:55:00,171
It was you who gave pride
to these people.

1613
01:55:02,887 --> 01:55:04,680
I was a fool.

1614
01:55:06,097 --> 01:55:09,215
I was a fool
to let them leave...

1615
01:55:09,306 --> 01:55:12,048
to believe I'd planned
it all so perfectly.

1616
01:55:15,633 --> 01:55:18,129
I once heard
a wise man say...

1617
01:55:19,752 --> 01:55:22,052
there are no perfect men
in this world...

1618
01:55:23,547 --> 01:55:25,001
only perfect intentions.

1619
01:55:30,798 --> 01:55:33,669
You were an honor
to your countrymen today, Azeem.

1620
01:55:36,293 --> 01:55:39,165
You fought better
than 20 English knights.

1621
01:56:07,503 --> 01:56:09,167
Will!

1622
01:56:11,037 --> 01:56:12,831
I thought you were taken.

1623
01:56:12,870 --> 01:56:13,831
I was.

1624
01:56:13,870 --> 01:56:15,664
How did you escape?

1625
01:56:15,703 --> 01:56:17,327
Traitor!

1626
01:56:17,366 --> 01:56:20,159
I'll wring your scrawny neck for you,
Will Scarlett!

1627
01:56:20,198 --> 01:56:22,668
You get in there!
No bugger escapes the sheriff...

1628
01:56:22,707 --> 01:56:25,578
not unless he's lining
his bloody pockets!

1629
01:56:25,656 --> 01:56:27,619
Now, get in!

1630
01:56:27,709 --> 01:56:29,658
Wait! Wait, John!

1631
01:56:29,697 --> 01:56:31,906
Let him betray us?

1632
01:56:31,997 --> 01:56:34,492
I'll have your guts for garters,
you little toad!

1633
01:56:36,207 --> 01:56:37,207
Aah!

1634
01:56:38,532 --> 01:56:40,742
- Bugger me.
- God.

1635
01:56:40,820 --> 01:56:42,236
Let him speak.

1636
01:56:45,198 --> 01:56:46,654
I bring a message...

1637
01:56:48,538 --> 01:56:50,746
from Nottingham.

1638
01:56:51,346 --> 01:56:53,309
Our men are to be hung
in the square...

1639
01:56:53,386 --> 01:56:55,842
- at high noon tomorrow.
- What about my boy?

1640
01:56:55,933 --> 01:56:58,141
The boy, too.

1641
01:56:58,220 --> 01:56:59,844
Ten men in all.

1642
01:57:00,844 --> 01:57:02,599
The hangings
are to be part...

1643
01:57:02,677 --> 01:57:06,171
of the celebration
for the sheriff s marriage.

1644
01:57:06,223 --> 01:57:07,757
Marriage? To who?

1645
01:57:09,719 --> 01:57:12,680
Lady Marian.

1646
01:57:12,720 --> 01:57:14,800
If he takes a bride
of royal blood...

1647
01:57:14,877 --> 01:57:16,514
Aye...

1648
01:57:16,554 --> 01:57:18,840
and with
King Richard gone...

1649
01:57:18,879 --> 01:57:20,296
he'll be after
the bloody throne.

1650
01:57:20,387 --> 01:57:22,842
You were to use this news
to get close to me...

1651
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:25,129
and then kill me,
right, Will?

1652
01:57:27,883 --> 01:57:29,715
What are your intentions?

1653
01:57:29,794 --> 01:57:32,665
That depends on you, Locksley.

1654
01:57:32,717 --> 01:57:37,043
I've never trusted you,
that's no secret.

1655
01:57:37,135 --> 01:57:39,423
Are you going to finish
what you've started?

1656
01:57:39,500 --> 01:57:41,540
Are you going to
turn and run...

1657
01:57:41,631 --> 01:57:44,165
like the spoiled rich boy
I always took him for?

1658
01:57:47,050 --> 01:57:50,453
Did I wrong you in another life,
Will Scarlett?

1659
01:57:50,545 --> 01:57:53,923
Where does this intolerable hatred
for me come from?

1660
01:58:06,332 --> 01:58:08,164
From knowing that our...

1661
01:58:08,254 --> 01:58:10,295
our father loved you
more than me.

1662
01:58:12,661 --> 01:58:14,583
Our father?

1663
01:58:14,661 --> 01:58:17,168
We are brothers,
Robin of Locksley.

1664
01:58:17,246 --> 01:58:19,793
I am the son
of the woman...

1665
01:58:19,872 --> 01:58:21,782
who replaced your dead mother
for a time!

1666
01:58:21,873 --> 01:58:24,704
It was your anger
that drove them apart!

1667
01:58:24,784 --> 01:58:26,991
- It's a lie!
- It's not a lie!

1668
01:58:27,083 --> 01:58:28,668
You ruined my life!

1669
01:58:41,076 --> 01:58:44,533
I have more reason
to hate you than anyone...

1670
01:58:44,571 --> 01:58:47,950
but I found myself
daring to believe in you.

1671
01:58:48,029 --> 01:58:51,238
What I want
to know, brother...

1672
01:58:51,329 --> 01:58:53,486
is will you stay
with us...

1673
01:58:53,577 --> 01:58:55,487
and finish
what you've started?

1674
01:59:00,567 --> 01:59:02,035
I have a brother?

1675
01:59:06,244 --> 01:59:07,701
I have a brother.

1676
01:59:11,910 --> 01:59:14,860
I will make
my stand with you...

1677
01:59:14,899 --> 01:59:16,367
side by side...

1678
01:59:16,406 --> 01:59:18,577
to the end.

1679
01:59:20,525 --> 01:59:21,980
To the end!

1680
01:59:24,904 --> 01:59:26,281
We're all bloody in.

1681
01:59:26,359 --> 01:59:28,815
Daft buggers.

1682
01:59:33,064 --> 01:59:34,818
We finish this.

1683
02:00:02,352 --> 02:00:05,145
Overwhelmed with happiness.

1684
02:00:05,184 --> 02:00:08,732
Thank you for asking.
Yes, all is well.

1685
02:00:08,810 --> 02:00:10,849
I got all my money back,
Robin Hood's probably dead...

1686
02:00:10,940 --> 02:00:14,774
and I'm gonna be king,
all as predicted.

1687
02:00:19,685 --> 02:00:21,478
I want you to tell the hangman
I don't want to see...

1688
02:00:21,517 --> 02:00:25,143
any broken necks
in the morning.

1689
02:00:25,221 --> 02:00:29,599
I wanna see some dancing.

1690
02:00:30,677 --> 02:00:33,393
Don't touch that!

1691
02:00:34,185 --> 02:00:36,642
I can do that myself.

1692
02:00:38,643 --> 02:00:41,645
Thank you very much.

1693
02:01:25,173 --> 02:01:27,461
Have you been spying
on me, you little insect?

1694
02:01:27,512 --> 02:01:28,928
No!

1695
02:01:31,008 --> 02:01:33,632
Who else would
have made a ho...

1696
02:01:36,711 --> 02:01:38,087
Oh!

1697
02:01:48,665 --> 02:01:51,173
Oh!

1698
02:01:53,044 --> 02:01:55,007
Where are you?

1699
02:02:01,049 --> 02:02:03,296
You come early.
The signs are not aligned yet.

1700
02:02:03,374 --> 02:02:06,752
You can stop all that,
you old fake!

1701
02:02:06,831 --> 02:02:10,703
I will try for thee anyway.

1702
02:02:15,536 --> 02:02:18,459
The union, the blood of the lion
and the House of Montague.

1703
02:02:18,498 --> 02:02:21,670
New power. New souls.

1704
02:02:21,747 --> 02:02:24,579
I found the hole!

1705
02:02:24,657 --> 02:02:27,867
You dare to spy on me!

1706
02:02:27,958 --> 02:02:30,413
I want the truth!

1707
02:02:31,947 --> 02:02:36,950
Why? Truth has never
served you before.

1708
02:02:37,041 --> 02:02:41,030
Truth didn't put Nottingham
where he is today.

1709
02:02:41,121 --> 02:02:45,538
- Mortianna did.
- You freak!

1710
02:02:45,617 --> 02:02:47,656
I despise you. After the wedding,
you're on the streets.

1711
02:02:47,748 --> 02:02:50,944
Without my protection, people will
rip out your black heart and burn it!

1712
02:02:51,034 --> 02:02:54,776
Without me, you're nothing.

1713
02:02:55,828 --> 02:02:59,948
You're a flea bite, a speck.

1714
02:03:01,494 --> 02:03:04,197
I birthed you
from this body.

1715
02:03:04,288 --> 02:03:08,109
I stole a babe
in this very castle and killed it...

1716
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:11,616
so that you might rise
in its place.

1717
02:03:13,942 --> 02:03:15,942
You're my son.

1718
02:03:19,230 --> 02:03:22,439
You despise me?

1719
02:03:22,530 --> 02:03:24,610
You are me.

1720
02:03:25,987 --> 02:03:28,572
You know from your empty soul
it's the truth.

1721
02:03:30,198 --> 02:03:32,524
All my life...

1722
02:03:32,615 --> 02:03:35,316
I've been a freak.

1723
02:03:35,394 --> 02:03:39,280
When you stud
the lady Marian...

1724
02:03:39,319 --> 02:03:41,736
my grandchild
takes the throne.

1725
02:03:41,814 --> 02:03:45,776
My blood,
its twisted seed...

1726
02:03:45,854 --> 02:03:48,024
we're all through him.

1727
02:03:48,102 --> 02:03:51,689
We'll see who's freakish then.

1728
02:04:26,472 --> 02:04:28,473
Aah! What was that?

1729
02:04:29,642 --> 02:04:31,605
Truly you are a wizard!

1730
02:04:31,644 --> 02:04:34,594
The mystery is
in the black powder.

1731
02:04:34,646 --> 02:04:37,517
Surely the Lord will
grant us victory.

1732
02:04:39,388 --> 02:04:40,636
- Bull.
- Yeah?

1733
02:04:40,727 --> 02:04:43,429
Position by the gate
to cut off reinforcements.

1734
02:04:43,469 --> 02:04:46,393
John, sit on this wall
to protect our escape.

1735
02:04:46,470 --> 02:04:49,472
I will conceal myself here
below the scaffold...

1736
02:04:49,550 --> 02:04:53,019
to cut our men from their nooses
at the signal.

1737
02:04:53,096 --> 02:04:55,383
No. I'll do that.
You cover us with your bow.

1738
02:04:55,474 --> 02:04:57,799
It's too dangerous, Will.

1739
02:04:57,891 --> 02:04:59,801
So is your aim.

1740
02:04:59,892 --> 02:05:01,802
Ha ha ha.

1741
02:05:01,880 --> 02:05:03,309
Whatever Azeem
is concocting...

1742
02:05:03,387 --> 02:05:05,297
we must each be
in place for it.

1743
02:05:05,388 --> 02:05:07,806
Our success depends
on total concert.

1744
02:05:07,884 --> 02:05:09,807
We may be only six men...

1745
02:05:09,884 --> 02:05:11,301
Seven.

1746
02:05:11,378 --> 02:05:12,795
What are you doing, woman?

1747
02:05:12,886 --> 02:05:14,302
Where's the little ones?

1748
02:05:14,380 --> 02:05:15,797
Safe with me mother.

1749
02:05:15,887 --> 02:05:18,303
You gone bleeding cracked?
You'd get hurt.

1750
02:05:18,381 --> 02:05:19,630
I've had eight babies.

1751
02:05:19,720 --> 02:05:21,799
Don't talk to me
about getting hurt.

1752
02:05:21,878 --> 02:05:24,800
I won't sit here
and let one of them die.

1753
02:05:24,879 --> 02:05:28,127
You should be bloody well
minding the other seven.

1754
02:05:28,218 --> 02:05:29,634
Tell her, Rob.

1755
02:05:33,883 --> 02:05:36,092
Fanny...

1756
02:05:36,131 --> 02:05:38,093
you will take position here.

1757
02:05:51,372 --> 02:05:53,582
No blades, no bows.

1758
02:05:53,634 --> 02:05:55,504
You'll leave your weapons here.

1759
02:05:55,583 --> 02:05:58,000
No blades, no bows.

1760
02:05:58,090 --> 02:06:00,546
Leave your weapons here.

1761
02:06:00,623 --> 02:06:02,132
No blades, no bows.

1762
02:06:02,170 --> 02:06:03,625
No blades.

1763
02:06:04,873 --> 02:06:06,795
What have you
got there, Father?

1764
02:06:06,873 --> 02:06:08,291
The lord's finest brew...

1765
02:06:08,369 --> 02:06:10,785
for the good sheriff s
fighting men.

1766
02:06:10,875 --> 02:06:13,409
It has a mighty kick, huh?

1767
02:06:16,788 --> 02:06:19,205
No blades, no bows.

1768
02:06:28,456 --> 02:06:31,288
Hey, who are you?
Hey!

1769
02:06:31,366 --> 02:06:33,369
Don't anger him.
He is a Celt.

1770
02:06:33,460 --> 02:06:34,406
Shh!

1771
02:06:37,500 --> 02:06:38,955
Psst.

1772
02:06:38,994 --> 02:06:41,372
John! John!

1773
02:07:13,868 --> 02:07:14,778
Hey, you.

1774
02:07:15,948 --> 02:07:17,364
Do I know you?

1775
02:07:17,442 --> 02:07:19,366
Please, sir, don't hurt me.

1776
02:07:19,443 --> 02:07:21,730
Oh, my God, you stink.

1777
02:07:21,821 --> 02:07:24,368
Pardon my blindness.
I'm always falling...

1778
02:07:24,445 --> 02:07:26,732
Get out of here!

1779
02:07:26,771 --> 02:07:28,980
Thank you
for noticing me, sir.

1780
02:07:29,071 --> 02:07:30,241
Careful, Friar.

1781
02:07:33,335 --> 02:07:34,751
What are you doing?

1782
02:07:34,830 --> 02:07:37,324
Ah, distributing libations
for the celebration...

1783
02:07:37,414 --> 02:07:39,702
of the sheriff s nuptials.

1784
02:07:39,741 --> 02:07:41,365
Why, is there
something amiss?

1785
02:07:41,416 --> 02:07:43,873
You are. Get this stuff
out of here.

1786
02:07:43,912 --> 02:07:45,874
Caesar has spoken,
my leprous friend.

1787
02:07:45,912 --> 02:07:48,368
We shall collect
our offerings and depart.

1788
02:07:48,407 --> 02:07:49,863
Is this your finger?

1789
02:07:49,914 --> 02:07:50,863
Leper? What?

1790
02:07:50,915 --> 02:07:52,864
Get this cart out of here.

1791
02:07:52,916 --> 02:07:56,944
Leaving bits and pieces
of himself all over England.

1792
02:08:04,692 --> 02:08:07,187
What are you doing here?

1793
02:08:07,264 --> 02:08:10,149
I ain't doing no harm.
I likes a good hanging.

1794
02:08:10,227 --> 02:08:12,515
- What's in this bundle?
- That's firewood.

1795
02:08:12,567 --> 02:08:14,646
- Psst.
- Hey!

1796
02:08:15,724 --> 02:08:18,101
Aah!

1797
02:08:18,179 --> 02:08:19,816
Hello, my lover.

1798
02:08:19,895 --> 02:08:24,976
Oyez, prepare
for the outdoor hanging.

1799
02:08:26,729 --> 02:08:28,223
Make way for
the Lord's work.

1800
02:08:28,262 --> 02:08:30,224
No fighting here.

1801
02:08:30,264 --> 02:08:32,356
Make way for
the Lord's work.

1802
02:08:32,395 --> 02:08:35,514
A simple benediction for these
poor bastards about to stretch.

1803
02:08:35,552 --> 02:08:38,060
God receive them
in thy mercy...

1804
02:08:38,137 --> 02:08:41,555
and show them the love
they so richly deserve...

1805
02:08:41,647 --> 02:08:44,556
even though they be
thieving sons of bitches.

1806
02:08:44,635 --> 02:08:45,557
Hey!

1807
02:08:45,635 --> 02:08:47,558
Nothing there
but trouble, boy.

1808
02:09:07,387 --> 02:09:11,089
That's a little inappropriate,
don't you think?

1809
02:09:11,180 --> 02:09:13,922
No more than
your wedding present.

1810
02:09:18,223 --> 02:09:19,639
Bring them out!

1811
02:09:19,718 --> 02:09:21,342
Oh, they're coming!

1812
02:09:30,385 --> 02:09:33,425
Get on. Get your
heads up in there.

1813
02:09:33,504 --> 02:09:34,842
Thief!

1814
02:09:36,050 --> 02:09:38,000
We're going to
get you vermin!

1815
02:09:58,088 --> 02:09:59,789
Patience!

1816
02:10:41,668 --> 02:10:43,292
Make way.

1817
02:10:55,700 --> 02:10:57,663
Traitor! Traitor!

1818
02:10:57,702 --> 02:10:58,910
Kill him!

1819
02:10:58,989 --> 02:11:00,573
Aah! Stop, stop!

1820
02:11:06,330 --> 02:11:08,279
What's going on?

1821
02:11:08,369 --> 02:11:09,903
Traitor!

1822
02:11:09,994 --> 02:11:11,827
Bring him here!

1823
02:11:13,073 --> 02:11:14,490
Kill him! Kill him!

1824
02:11:14,528 --> 02:11:16,607
What did I do?

1825
02:11:19,323 --> 02:11:21,441
Clear the way!
Clear the way!

1826
02:11:21,533 --> 02:11:22,948
Stand still.

1827
02:11:24,482 --> 02:11:26,782
Oh, the turncoat.

1828
02:11:26,859 --> 02:11:29,615
Did you succeed?

1829
02:11:29,692 --> 02:11:34,111
Well, I... I found
his lair, but, uh...

1830
02:11:34,188 --> 02:11:35,774
he was already dead.

1831
02:11:36,865 --> 02:11:39,112
You sure?
You saw Hood's body?

1832
02:11:40,814 --> 02:11:44,154
No... I saw a grave.

1833
02:11:45,571 --> 02:11:46,947
We found this on him.

1834
02:11:51,145 --> 02:11:52,898
String him up
with the others.

1835
02:11:52,977 --> 02:11:55,069
Yay!

1836
02:11:57,863 --> 02:11:59,811
Put me down!

1837
02:12:03,736 --> 02:12:05,307
Let me go!

1838
02:12:10,141 --> 02:12:12,064
Leave him.
He's only a boy.

1839
02:12:12,142 --> 02:12:13,559
Shut up!

1840
02:12:13,650 --> 02:12:14,806
Bastard.

1841
02:12:16,183 --> 02:12:17,391
You all right?

1842
02:12:17,482 --> 02:12:18,978
Now, Robin?

1843
02:12:35,012 --> 02:12:35,973
My lord...

1844
02:12:36,012 --> 02:12:38,428
it appears
there's no more room.

1845
02:12:38,519 --> 02:12:41,806
I'm afraid I'll have
to respectfully decline.

1846
02:12:41,884 --> 02:12:43,560
Come on, you. Down.

1847
02:12:43,639 --> 02:12:44,769
Down!

1848
02:12:47,225 --> 02:12:48,342
Go on.

1849
02:12:48,433 --> 02:12:49,719
Hold your tongue!

1850
02:12:52,305 --> 02:12:54,384
There's always room
for one more.

1851
02:12:54,475 --> 02:12:55,723
Ha ha ha ha!

1852
02:13:29,012 --> 02:13:30,805
- No.
- My boy! John!

1853
02:13:34,132 --> 02:13:35,887
My boy!

1854
02:13:51,297 --> 02:13:52,712
Wulf!

1855
02:14:06,461 --> 02:14:08,293
Locksley.

1856
02:14:08,370 --> 02:14:11,333
Robin!

1857
02:14:29,328 --> 02:14:30,785
Wulf!

1858
02:14:41,451 --> 02:14:44,453
Get some troops in here!

1859
02:14:53,873 --> 02:14:55,706
Get on with it!

1860
02:14:59,201 --> 02:15:00,786
No!

1861
02:15:04,866 --> 02:15:06,697
I can't let go.

1862
02:15:08,621 --> 02:15:11,077
Help!

1863
02:15:45,652 --> 02:15:49,278
- Wulf!
- Father.

1864
02:15:49,317 --> 02:15:50,604
Oh, thank God.

1865
02:15:52,774 --> 02:15:55,645
Come on, you milksops!

1866
02:15:55,697 --> 02:15:58,400
- Fight your way free!
- Look out!

1867
02:16:03,518 --> 02:16:04,897
Aah!

1868
02:16:04,987 --> 02:16:06,559
This way!
To the wall!

1869
02:16:06,651 --> 02:16:11,225
My lord sheriff,
is this your idea of control?

1870
02:16:12,354 --> 02:16:14,772
Shut up, you twit!

1871
02:16:14,811 --> 02:16:17,527
- Come with me.
- Robin!

1872
02:16:19,813 --> 02:16:21,515
Marian.

1873
02:16:21,605 --> 02:16:22,723
Marian!

1874
02:16:23,764 --> 02:16:27,933
English!

1875
02:16:27,972 --> 02:16:32,352
Behold, Azeem Edin
Bashir Al Bakir.

1876
02:16:32,430 --> 02:16:34,392
I am not one of you...

1877
02:16:34,470 --> 02:16:36,730
but I fight.

1878
02:16:36,809 --> 02:16:39,563
I fight with Robin Hood.

1879
02:16:39,641 --> 02:16:43,267
I fight against a tyrant
who holds you under his boot.

1880
02:16:43,305 --> 02:16:45,852
If you would be free men...

1881
02:16:45,930 --> 02:16:48,100
then you must fight.

1882
02:16:48,140 --> 02:16:51,011
Join us now.

1883
02:16:51,101 --> 02:16:53,934
- Join Robin Hood.
- Freedom!

1884
02:16:54,012 --> 02:16:56,729
Come on, now!
Come on!

1885
02:16:58,976 --> 02:17:01,601
- Come on!
- Get back!

1886
02:17:19,337 --> 02:17:22,506
Help, Robin!

1887
02:17:28,134 --> 02:17:30,212
John!

1888
02:17:32,097 --> 02:17:33,513
Close the gate.

1889
02:17:33,591 --> 02:17:34,513
No!

1890
02:17:34,591 --> 02:17:36,631
Guard it with your life.

1891
02:17:36,710 --> 02:17:39,672
Bring the bishop to my chapel.

1892
02:17:39,750 --> 02:17:41,165
Push.

1893
02:17:41,257 --> 02:17:43,259
Right there.

1894
02:17:50,248 --> 02:17:52,341
Is she worth it?

1895
02:17:52,419 --> 02:17:53,964
Worth dying for?

1896
02:17:59,915 --> 02:18:01,371
Will!

1897
02:18:01,462 --> 02:18:04,425
- Aah!
- Aah!

1898
02:18:10,090 --> 02:18:12,337
Fuck me.
He cleared it.

1899
02:18:16,795 --> 02:18:17,911
Marian!

1900
02:18:41,496 --> 02:18:42,833
Aah!

1901
02:18:45,497 --> 02:18:47,447
We're doomed.

1902
02:18:52,163 --> 02:18:53,540
'Tis rebellion, my lord.

1903
02:18:53,619 --> 02:18:54,956
We must escape.

1904
02:18:55,033 --> 02:18:55,957
Marry us!

1905
02:18:56,035 --> 02:18:56,997
No!

1906
02:18:57,074 --> 02:19:00,037
I will never marry you!

1907
02:19:00,114 --> 02:19:01,206
Aah!

1908
02:19:01,284 --> 02:19:04,988
That's my wife, crone!

1909
02:19:05,078 --> 02:19:06,157
Get away!

1910
02:19:06,235 --> 02:19:08,860
Ah, she's ripe.

1911
02:19:08,951 --> 02:19:10,327
She will give us a son.

1912
02:19:10,406 --> 02:19:12,485
You must take her now.

1913
02:19:12,575 --> 02:19:14,746
I will not take her...

1914
02:19:14,824 --> 02:19:17,410
until we are properly wed!

1915
02:19:17,449 --> 02:19:21,982
For once in my life,
I will have something pure.

1916
02:19:22,074 --> 02:19:23,322
Will you stop interfering?

1917
02:19:23,400 --> 02:19:26,192
'Tis madness to delay.

1918
02:19:26,284 --> 02:19:27,855
- No!
- Aah!

1919
02:19:27,946 --> 02:19:29,857
Marry them or face me.

1920
02:19:36,277 --> 02:19:37,484
Aah!

1921
02:19:40,654 --> 02:19:41,733
Marian!

1922
02:19:46,319 --> 02:19:47,490
Aah!

1923
02:19:47,567 --> 02:19:48,646
Marian!

1924
02:19:51,609 --> 02:19:53,024
Where is she?

1925
02:19:57,573 --> 02:19:58,988
The lady Marian.

1926
02:19:59,067 --> 02:20:01,651
Up the stairs.
That way.

1927
02:20:01,731 --> 02:20:04,355
Aah! Aah!

1928
02:20:04,433 --> 02:20:05,356
Marian?

1929
02:20:05,434 --> 02:20:07,526
Aah!

1930
02:20:07,603 --> 02:20:09,189
Marian!

1931
02:20:09,267 --> 02:20:11,021
Robin!

1932
02:20:11,099 --> 02:20:13,023
Get on with it!

1933
02:20:13,100 --> 02:20:14,230
Robin!

1934
02:20:17,765 --> 02:20:18,896
- Statue.
- Statue.

1935
02:20:20,935 --> 02:20:23,976
Do you, George,
sheriff of Nottingham...

1936
02:20:24,067 --> 02:20:27,016
take this woman to be
your lawful wedded wife?

1937
02:20:35,566 --> 02:20:38,138
To have and to hold...

1938
02:20:38,229 --> 02:20:40,387
in sickness and in health,
for better or for worse...

1939
02:20:40,478 --> 02:20:41,933
for richer, for poorer,
till death...

1940
02:20:41,971 --> 02:20:43,557
Yes, yes. Come on!

1941
02:20:43,635 --> 02:20:44,804
Make haste.

1942
02:20:44,895 --> 02:20:47,312
Do you, Marian,
of the House of Dubois...

1943
02:20:47,389 --> 02:20:49,470
take this man to be your
lawfully wedded husband...

1944
02:20:49,561 --> 02:20:50,469
No!

1945
02:20:50,561 --> 02:20:52,847
Yes, of course she does.

1946
02:20:57,096 --> 02:20:58,136
Aah!

1947
02:20:58,226 --> 02:20:59,137
Marian!

1948
02:20:59,227 --> 02:21:00,643
Damned English oak.

1949
02:21:00,721 --> 02:21:01,644
Robin!

1950
02:21:01,722 --> 02:21:02,631
Marian!

1951
02:21:02,721 --> 02:21:03,633
Robin!

1952
02:21:03,723 --> 02:21:05,139
I'll try another way.

1953
02:21:12,506 --> 02:21:15,639
No! No! No! No!

1954
02:21:17,548 --> 02:21:19,133
What do you want?

1955
02:21:19,223 --> 02:21:21,173
Aah!

1956
02:21:23,383 --> 02:21:26,306
I can't do this
with all that racket!

1957
02:21:30,086 --> 02:21:33,465
How could you?
How could you?

1958
02:21:44,588 --> 02:21:46,966
Yaaah!

1959
02:21:47,044 --> 02:21:48,044
Uhh! Uhh!

1960
02:21:49,421 --> 02:21:51,007
The painted man.

1961
02:21:51,084 --> 02:21:52,176
The witch.

1962
02:21:52,254 --> 02:21:53,840
I didn't know.
I didn't know it was you.

1963
02:21:53,917 --> 02:21:56,880
Please, sire, have pity.

1964
02:21:56,957 --> 02:21:59,505
Don't harm an old woman.

1965
02:22:02,129 --> 02:22:05,872
Aah!

1966
02:22:17,371 --> 02:22:20,541
You may take this body,
but it will not be me.

1967
02:22:20,580 --> 02:22:22,373
It will not be me!

1968
02:22:24,284 --> 02:22:25,543
Not again.

1969
02:22:25,621 --> 02:22:28,791
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

1970
02:22:28,870 --> 02:22:30,702
In the name
of the Father...

1971
02:22:30,754 --> 02:22:33,626
the Son,
and the Holy Ghost.

1972
02:22:33,704 --> 02:22:36,705
Aah!

1973
02:22:41,292 --> 02:22:43,202
Robin.

1974
02:22:46,580 --> 02:22:49,036
Do you mind, Locksley?

1975
02:22:49,114 --> 02:22:51,869
We've just been married.

1976
02:22:55,078 --> 02:22:57,080
Uhh!

1977
02:23:04,537 --> 02:23:05,954
Recognize this?

1978
02:23:08,279 --> 02:23:11,788
It belonged to your father.

1979
02:23:11,866 --> 02:23:13,698
Appropriate,
don't you think...

1980
02:23:13,736 --> 02:23:16,154
that I now use it
to send you to meet him?

1981
02:23:17,908 --> 02:23:21,325
I shall never fear
my father's sword.

1982
02:23:21,404 --> 02:23:23,702
Really?

1983
02:23:23,780 --> 02:23:25,366
Aah!

1984
02:23:26,406 --> 02:23:29,108
Now we're even.

1985
02:23:40,608 --> 02:23:42,154
Robin!

1986
02:23:58,188 --> 02:24:00,774
If I must, I will take you
a piece at a time.

1987
02:24:02,060 --> 02:24:02,982
No!

1988
02:24:05,023 --> 02:24:06,945
I'll do the only taking today.

1989
02:24:07,024 --> 02:24:08,933
Aah!

1990
02:24:11,896 --> 02:24:13,351
No!

1991
02:24:16,067 --> 02:24:18,770
So...

1992
02:24:18,848 --> 02:24:22,109
you sold your soul
to Satan, your grace.

1993
02:24:24,058 --> 02:24:25,943
You accused innocent men
of witchcraft...

1994
02:24:26,020 --> 02:24:27,982
and let them die.

1995
02:24:28,060 --> 02:24:31,555
Brother friar,
you would not strike...

1996
02:24:31,647 --> 02:24:34,141
a fellow man of the cloth.

1997
02:24:34,232 --> 02:24:36,934
No. No, I wouldn't.

1998
02:24:37,013 --> 02:24:40,847
In fact, I'll help you
pack for your journey.

1999
02:24:40,937 --> 02:24:42,679
You're going
to need lots of gold...

2000
02:24:42,769 --> 02:24:45,225
to help you on your way.

2001
02:24:45,263 --> 02:24:48,227
You're a very rich man.
This, too, huh?

2002
02:24:48,304 --> 02:24:49,811
Enough?

2003
02:24:49,890 --> 02:24:52,514
Here's 30 pieces of silver...

2004
02:24:52,592 --> 02:24:56,010
to pay the devil
on your way to hell!

2005
02:24:56,062 --> 02:24:59,687
Aah!

2006
02:25:10,887 --> 02:25:13,641
Oh! Robin!

2007
02:25:26,882 --> 02:25:28,337
No!

2008
02:25:32,717 --> 02:25:34,471
Oh! Robin!

2009
02:25:46,385 --> 02:25:47,750
Aah! Robin!

2010
02:25:49,581 --> 02:25:52,168
Robin!

2011
02:26:00,836 --> 02:26:02,589
Robin.

2012
02:26:04,213 --> 02:26:05,421
Get ready.

2013
02:26:06,708 --> 02:26:08,124
No!

2014
02:26:57,123 --> 02:26:58,956
Ohh.

2015
02:27:21,199 --> 02:27:27,489
Aah!

2016
02:27:36,441 --> 02:27:38,949
I have fulfilled my vow, Sadiq.

2017
02:27:56,777 --> 02:27:58,270
You came for me.

2018
02:28:00,155 --> 02:28:02,104
You're alive.

2019
02:28:02,194 --> 02:28:03,987
I would die for you.

2020
02:28:12,771 --> 02:28:16,188
By the power vested in me
by God's holy church...

2021
02:28:16,267 --> 02:28:18,683
I say any man
who has reason...

2022
02:28:18,775 --> 02:28:20,854
why these two
should not be joined...

2023
02:28:21,974 --> 02:28:26,206
let him speak now
or forever hold his peace.

2024
02:28:30,810 --> 02:28:32,116
Then I now pronounce you...

2025
02:28:32,289 --> 02:28:34,122
Hold it. I speak.

2026
02:28:44,348 --> 02:28:46,271
Richard.

2027
02:28:48,181 --> 02:28:49,638
It's King Richard.

2028
02:28:56,432 --> 02:28:58,550
I will not allow
this wedding to proceed...

2029
02:28:58,642 --> 02:28:59,771
My lord...

2030
02:28:59,849 --> 02:29:01,266
Unless...

2031
02:29:02,383 --> 02:29:04,970
I'm allowed
to give the bride away.

2032
02:29:05,061 --> 02:29:06,307
You look radiant, cousin.

2033
02:29:06,385 --> 02:29:07,803
Oh...

2034
02:29:07,894 --> 02:29:09,803
Richard.

2035
02:29:09,841 --> 02:29:12,141
We are deeply honored,
your majesty.

2036
02:29:12,181 --> 02:29:15,558
It is I who am honored,
Lord Locksley.

2037
02:29:15,636 --> 02:29:18,807
Thanks to you,
I still have a throne.

2038
02:29:18,847 --> 02:29:20,263
Friar, proceed.

2039
02:29:24,472 --> 02:29:26,006
My liege.

2040
02:29:28,254 --> 02:29:30,554
Husband and wife.

2041
02:29:32,177 --> 02:29:34,296
You may kiss the bride.

2042
02:29:34,348 --> 02:29:35,803
I know that.

2043
02:29:39,219 --> 02:29:42,794
- Hurrah!
- Hurrah!

2044
02:30:01,504 --> 02:30:03,960
Come on, get out of it.

2045
02:30:03,999 --> 02:30:05,962
We waste
good celebration time.
