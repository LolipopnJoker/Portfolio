1
00:01:56,465 --> 00:01:57,865
What a mess.

2
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,590
You've never seen a dead man before?

3
00:02:08,737 --> 00:02:10,437
Put a blanket on him. Cover him.

4
00:02:10,605 --> 00:02:11,970
I'm coming.

5
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:13,908
Be careful.

6
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:16,833
One minute. I'll be right there. Cover him.

7
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,712
What the hell
are you doing to me?

8
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,300
What are you doing?

9
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,553
Goddamn it! Where am I?

10
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,265
A boat! A fishing boat.
You were in the water.

11
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:08,642
We pulled you out.

12
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,060
What water?

13
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,646
You were shot. See?
There are the bullets.

14
00:05:14,732 --> 00:05:18,486
Look, there is a number
for a bank. Why was it in your hip?

15
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:19,821
My hip?

16
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:21,614
- Why was it in your hip?
- My hip.

17
00:05:21,698 --> 00:05:23,449
Yeah, in your hip under the skin.

18
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:24,868
Oh, God.

19
00:05:24,951 --> 00:05:27,871
- What are you doing with me?
- You need to rest.

20
00:05:27,954 --> 00:05:29,623
Please. Lie down.

21
00:05:29,957 --> 00:05:32,710
I'm a friend. I'm your friend.

22
00:05:33,877 --> 00:05:35,796
My name is Giancarlo.

23
00:05:36,422 --> 00:05:37,798
Who are you?

24
00:05:39,008 --> 00:05:40,676
What's your name?

25
00:05:41,344 --> 00:05:43,012
What's your name?

26
00:05:43,137 --> 00:05:44,639
I don't know.

27
00:05:46,725 --> 00:05:48,727
- Oh, God.
- Lie down.

28
00:06:15,881 --> 00:06:18,718
It's been confirmed, sir. Mission failed.

29
00:07:03,086 --> 00:07:04,951
Do you know who I am?

30
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:09,569
I do not know who I am.

31
00:07:15,577 --> 00:07:16,977
Tell me who I am.

32
00:07:19,014 --> 00:07:20,641
If you know who I am...

33
00:07:21,683 --> 00:07:24,083
Please stop messing around...

34
00:07:24,786 --> 00:07:26,346
and tell me.

35
00:07:38,596 --> 00:07:40,356
If you want
to eat, get in there.

36
00:07:40,431 --> 00:07:44,185
Based on these charts, I think
I may have been closer to the coast.

37
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:47,063
What is this? You tie these knots?

38
00:07:47,898 --> 00:07:51,099
- So, it starts to come back?
- No, it doesn't start to come back.

39
00:07:51,109 --> 00:07:54,071
The knot's like everything else.
I found the rope and I did it.

40
00:07:54,154 --> 00:07:55,781
Same way I can read.

41
00:07:55,865 --> 00:07:58,451
I can write. I can add, subtract.
I can make coffee.

42
00:07:58,534 --> 00:08:02,121
- I can shuffle cards, I can set up a chessboard.
- Yes, it will come back.

43
00:08:02,205 --> 00:08:05,542
No, it's not coming back, goddamn it!
That's the point!

44
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:08,295
I'm down here looking through this,
all this shit!

45
00:08:08,378 --> 00:08:10,339
For two weeks I'm down here.

46
00:08:10,505 --> 00:08:13,634
It's not working.
I don't even know what to look for.

47
00:08:17,221 --> 00:08:20,558
You need to rest.
It will come back.

48
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:23,269
What if it doesn't come back?

49
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:29,192
We get in there tomorrow,
I don't even have a name.

50
00:08:59,684 --> 00:09:03,396
It's not much,
but it should get you to Switzerland.

51
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,527
Thank you.

52
00:10:46,236 --> 00:10:48,227
Hey.

53
00:10:48,657 --> 00:10:50,617
Can't you read the signs?

54
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,615
On your feet... let's go... right now.

55
00:10:53,628 --> 00:10:55,668
The park is closed.
There's no sleeping in the park.

56
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,853
All right.

57
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,133
Let's see some identification.

58
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,275
No, I don't...

59
00:11:02,358 --> 00:11:03,568
Come on... your papers.

60
00:11:03,651 --> 00:11:05,528
I don't have any papers. I lost my...

61
00:11:05,939 --> 00:11:08,499
I've lost them...
my papers... they are lost.

62
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,879
Ok... let's go...
put your hands up.

63
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:16,517
I just need to sleep...

64
00:11:38,856 --> 00:11:42,318
These people have
threatened my family. My babies.

65
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,779
So I'm telling you,
when the evidence is clear...

66
00:11:44,863 --> 00:11:47,449
I will have a nice story
for you to read about.

67
00:11:47,532 --> 00:11:50,744
And all my friends out there,
you will read about yourselves.

68
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,538
If you want to play this game...

69
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:55,803
after I have been reasonable,
I will show you.

70
00:11:55,804 --> 00:11:59,880
That's Nykwana Wombosi speaking
in Paris the day before yesterday.

71
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:02,216
He was an irritation
before he took power...

72
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:06,088
he was a problem when he was in power and
he's been a disaster for us in exile.

73
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:10,255
He's writing a book about the agency's
history in Africa. He's going to name names.

74
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,265
It's basically a shakedown.
He's demanding the agency's help.

75
00:12:13,334 --> 00:12:17,464
He wants us to put him back
in power in six months or else.

76
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:21,305
This interview, and I'll make the tape
available to anyone who wants it...

77
00:12:21,377 --> 00:12:24,574
he goes on to claim that he's just
survived an assassination attempt.

78
00:12:25,848 --> 00:12:28,442
He says it's us.
He says he's got proof.

79
00:12:30,153 --> 00:12:34,613
The director wants to know if there's any
possible shred of truth in this accusation.

80
00:12:34,691 --> 00:12:38,889
I've already assured him there's nobody
that reckless on my senior staff.

81
00:12:45,637 --> 00:12:48,765
I was recalling a conversation
we had some time ago.

82
00:12:48,932 --> 00:12:50,559
Talking about Treadstone.

83
00:12:50,642 --> 00:12:54,480
I seem to remember Wombosi's name
might have come up.

84
00:12:55,773 --> 00:12:57,653
I'm not sure
what we're talking about.

85
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:59,443
Someone tried to take him out.

86
00:13:00,445 --> 00:13:02,488
Tried and failed.

87
00:13:03,406 --> 00:13:05,200
Was this Treadstone?

88
00:13:05,992 --> 00:13:08,537
You're asking
me a direct question?

89
00:13:09,162 --> 00:13:10,247
Yes.

90
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,042
I thought you
were never gonna do that.

91
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,460
What happened?

92
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:21,008
Well, we lost the communication
with our man.

93
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,177
This was almost two weeks ago.

94
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:25,347
We've worked around the clock.

95
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,725
We've been sleeping down there.
We're doing everything we can.

96
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:32,896
- And you don't let me know this?
- You never wanted to before.

97
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:35,065
You never made a mistake before.

98
00:14:06,855 --> 00:14:08,584
What can I do for you?

99
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,981
Yes, I'm here about a numbered account.

100
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:17,820
If you just enter your account number here,
I'll direct you to an appropriate officer.

101
00:16:18,993 --> 00:16:20,953
My name is Jason Bourne.

102
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,628
I live in Paris.

103
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:04,948
I'm trying to think...

104
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:07,419
How long's it been since I was here last?

105
00:18:07,495 --> 00:18:08,925
I'm not sure.

106
00:18:09,264 --> 00:18:11,364
It must be three weeks.

107
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:27,257
Yes, in Paris.

108
00:18:27,465 --> 00:18:30,344
Do you have the number
for a Jason Bourne?

109
00:18:31,803 --> 00:18:34,056
Yes. Would you like me to connect you?

110
00:18:34,139 --> 00:18:35,558
Yes, please.

111
00:18:40,354 --> 00:18:43,566
This is 46990384.

112
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,568
Leave a message at the beep.

113
00:19:50,847 --> 00:19:52,015
I'm an American.

114
00:19:52,099 --> 00:19:53,183
Okay.

115
00:19:54,101 --> 00:19:55,352
Hold it.

116
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,146
You've no jurisdiction here.

117
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:58,814
Hold it there. Okay?

118
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,863
No.

119
00:20:04,988 --> 00:20:07,574
Excuse me. No.
This is not my current address, okay?

120
00:20:07,908 --> 00:20:11,495
This was my address until two days ago,
when I started standing in line.

121
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:13,789
Now I lose my apartment, okay?

122
00:20:13,956 --> 00:20:16,792
That means no address, no phone,
no money, no time.

123
00:20:16,876 --> 00:20:19,253
- And I still have no visa!
- Miss Kreutz, please.

124
00:20:19,337 --> 00:20:21,547
I must ask you
to keep your voice down.

125
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,884
Excuse me. But where's the guy
that I talked to last week?

126
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:27,512
Every week it's a new person.
How am I supposed to...

127
00:20:27,596 --> 00:20:29,097
I don't know who you saw last week.

128
00:20:29,181 --> 00:20:31,850
Let me help you. I'm sure I have it.
Hang on.

129
00:20:31,934 --> 00:20:34,061
Could I have your attention for a moment?

130
00:20:34,144 --> 00:20:36,272
I have it right here.
Just look at it.

131
00:20:36,439 --> 00:20:40,693
You staged an effort to circumvent
the immigration laws of the United States.

132
00:20:41,402 --> 00:20:42,946
This is a student visa now.

133
00:20:43,154 --> 00:20:45,991
It's not about a green card anymore.
It's completely different.

134
00:20:46,074 --> 00:20:51,288
- It's not a menu. You don't just...
- I brought all this proof.

135
00:20:51,371 --> 00:20:52,873
Potential suspect...

136
00:20:52,956 --> 00:20:55,042
Help in assault incident.

137
00:20:58,462 --> 00:21:00,631
You! Red bag! The red bag!

138
00:21:00,715 --> 00:21:03,635
Stop right there! Put your hands up!

139
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,261
I'm on it.

140
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:52,187
Move it! Now!
Now! Move!

141
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,736
Alpha Unit, take the back stairs
and work your way up. Bravo...

142
00:22:06,745 --> 00:22:08,455
Move in! Move in!

143
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:12,417
Okay, clear!

144
00:22:12,501 --> 00:22:13,669
Suspect is...

145
00:22:13,752 --> 00:22:16,797
Moving up staircase.
Proceeding to second floor.

146
00:22:21,427 --> 00:22:23,513
Alpha Unit, you're clear.

147
00:22:31,438 --> 00:22:32,898
Move! Move!

148
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:37,153
All Units, target may have a radio.

149
00:22:37,236 --> 00:22:39,280
Go to Code 77. Over.

150
00:22:39,488 --> 00:22:41,491
Code 77, copy.

151
00:22:41,616 --> 00:22:43,076
The floor! Down!

152
00:22:44,911 --> 00:22:46,246
Clear!

153
00:24:11,129 --> 00:24:12,589
Go. Move up.

154
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:21,664
- He's in Zurich now? Right now?
- Yes. It just came in.

155
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:25,210
- They're sure it's him?
- Yes. He went to the bank.

156
00:25:25,293 --> 00:25:27,254
Our source at the bank, that's who called.

157
00:25:27,546 --> 00:25:28,421
Come on.

158
00:25:28,505 --> 00:25:31,091
But he's got to assume
we're watching the bank, right?

159
00:25:31,174 --> 00:25:33,302
- I don't know.
- Come on.

160
00:25:33,385 --> 00:25:36,514
I mean, he cleaned out the box.
He left a gun. What does that mean?

161
00:25:36,597 --> 00:25:38,265
I said I don't know!

162
00:25:38,349 --> 00:25:40,726
I liked it better when
I thought he was dead.

163
00:25:57,244 --> 00:25:59,247
What are you looking at?

164
00:25:59,413 --> 00:26:00,915
I heard you inside.

165
00:26:00,998 --> 00:26:01,874
What?

166
00:26:01,958 --> 00:26:05,837
The consulate. I heard you talking.
I thought maybe we could help each other.

167
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,005
How's that?

168
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:09,633
You need money. I need a ride out of here.

169
00:26:10,884 --> 00:26:12,761
I'm not running a car service. Thank you.

170
00:26:12,845 --> 00:26:15,973
I'll give you $10,000
to drive me to Paris.

171
00:26:17,151 --> 00:26:18,981
What, do you think I'm a fool?

172
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,145
You'd be a fool not to take it.

173
00:26:23,898 --> 00:26:27,903
- What is this, a joke? Some kind of scam?
- No, it's no scam.

174
00:26:28,528 --> 00:26:31,073
I'll give you another $10,000
when we get there.

175
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:32,866
Jesus.

176
00:26:39,248 --> 00:26:42,835
- Is that for you?
- Look. You drive, I pay. It's that simple.

177
00:26:47,382 --> 00:26:49,509
I got enough trouble, okay?

178
00:26:49,718 --> 00:26:50,844
Okay.

179
00:26:50,928 --> 00:26:52,930
Can I have my money back?

180
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,616
All right, go. Keep going.

181
00:27:11,325 --> 00:27:12,326
Go.

182
00:27:13,035 --> 00:27:15,412
- There! Wait!
- No, it's got to be near the end.

183
00:27:15,496 --> 00:27:18,499
Come on, folks! We caught a break here!
Let's go!

184
00:27:18,582 --> 00:27:19,709
Okay, I'm up.

185
00:27:19,834 --> 00:27:22,837
We're getting grids.
Airline, train, hotels, hospitals.

186
00:27:22,921 --> 00:27:25,423
- Who's getting the address? The street?
- Gemensheidt.

187
00:27:25,507 --> 00:27:27,676
Here we go.
I think I got it.

188
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:29,094
Is it him?

189
00:27:29,511 --> 00:27:30,804
Unreal.

190
00:27:31,263 --> 00:27:32,864
This is 38 minutes ago.

191
00:27:32,931 --> 00:27:36,477
Zurich police are looking
for an American carrying a red bank bag.

192
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:40,398
He just tore up the embassy and
put two cops in the hospital last night.

193
00:27:42,609 --> 00:27:45,737
Get everybody up. Do it now.
I want them all activated.

194
00:27:45,862 --> 00:27:47,656
Wait. All of them? At the same time?

195
00:27:47,739 --> 00:27:51,368
You heard me.
I want Bourne in a body bag by sundown.

196
00:27:51,451 --> 00:27:55,331
All right, let's get a map up here!
Come on, folks! Let's work it!

197
00:28:00,002 --> 00:28:01,713
The grids are getting updated.

198
00:29:18,462 --> 00:29:20,798
Which was fine with me
because I was ready.

199
00:29:20,882 --> 00:29:23,885
After six months in Amsterdam,
you're not sure...

200
00:29:23,968 --> 00:29:26,596
if you've been there 20
minutes or years, you know.

201
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,850
So I went. I took all the money I had.
I went in with friends...

202
00:29:29,933 --> 00:29:34,313
we took over this really cool surf shop
outside Biarritz, right by the water.

203
00:29:34,396 --> 00:29:35,940
It was amazing.

204
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:40,862
It was just amazing for about three months,
until it turned out that this...

205
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:45,492
jerk who had fronted us the lease
was actually shining everyone on and...

206
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:53,459
And what?

207
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:57,213
What do you mean "what"?
Listen to me.

208
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,882
I've been speed-talking
for about 60 kilometres now.

209
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:03,219
I talk when I'm nervous.
I mean, I talk like this when I'm nervous.

210
00:30:03,303 --> 00:30:05,722
- I'm gonna shut up now.
- No, don't do that.

211
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,851
I haven't talked to anybody in a while.

212
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:13,188
Yeah, but we're not talking. I'm talking.

213
00:30:13,689 --> 00:30:16,525
You've said,
like, 10 words since we left Zurich.

214
00:30:16,609 --> 00:30:19,278
Well, listening
to you, it's relaxing.

215
00:30:21,781 --> 00:30:24,242
I haven't slept in a while and...

216
00:30:25,034 --> 00:30:26,870
And I've had this headache.

217
00:30:27,537 --> 00:30:29,372
It's like a constant thing
inside my head.

218
00:30:29,456 --> 00:30:32,751
And it's just starting
to move to the background...

219
00:30:32,835 --> 00:30:34,336
so keep going.

220
00:30:35,713 --> 00:30:37,965
Really, if you want, please keep talking.

221
00:30:40,843 --> 00:30:41,969
Okay.

222
00:30:44,055 --> 00:30:45,765
What kind of music do you like?

223
00:30:48,685 --> 00:30:50,812
What do you like? Come on.

224
00:30:51,813 --> 00:30:54,525
- You know what? Never mind.
- No, it's fine. Tell me.

225
00:30:54,608 --> 00:30:56,318
What do you want to listen to?

226
00:30:56,986 --> 00:30:58,487
I don't know.

227
00:30:58,988 --> 00:31:02,742
Come on, it's not that hard.
What do you like? Tell me.

228
00:31:02,825 --> 00:31:04,285
I don't know.

229
00:31:14,755 --> 00:31:17,466
Who pays $20,000 for a ride to Paris?

230
00:31:27,561 --> 00:31:28,812
Fuck it.

231
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:33,275
I can't remember anything
that happened before two weeks ago.

232
00:31:34,568 --> 00:31:36,445
- Lucky you.
- No, I'm serious.

233
00:31:37,905 --> 00:31:40,491
I don't know who I am.
I don't know where I'm going.

234
00:31:40,616 --> 00:31:41,993
None of it.

235
00:31:42,243 --> 00:31:45,288
- What? Like amnesia?
- Yes.

236
00:31:47,374 --> 00:31:49,209
- Amnesia.
- Yes.

237
00:31:53,255 --> 00:31:54,465
Right.

238
00:32:01,556 --> 00:32:05,059
- And that's the best angle of the courtyard?
- That's the only angle.

239
00:32:05,477 --> 00:32:08,522
What do they have of the streets?
Or, you know, the area?

240
00:32:08,605 --> 00:32:09,856
They must have something.

241
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,191
Hang on.

242
00:32:13,485 --> 00:32:14,862
What is he doing?

243
00:32:16,614 --> 00:32:19,951
Is it a game? Is he warning us?
Is it a threat?

244
00:32:20,827 --> 00:32:22,787
Sir? Look at this.

245
00:32:24,581 --> 00:32:27,417
- What's that?
- It's an angle of the street, a sort of alley.

246
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,127
Just enhance it.

247
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,302
Now, who the hell is that?

248
00:32:37,428 --> 00:32:39,805
Marie Helena Kreutz.

249
00:32:40,306 --> 00:32:43,476
She's 26, born outside Hanover.
Her father was a welder.

250
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,061
He died in '87.

251
00:32:45,437 --> 00:32:48,899
We still don't have the mother.
The grandmother, she's still in Hanover.

252
00:32:48,982 --> 00:32:52,486
It looks like she's the anchor
for this little domestic disaster.

253
00:32:52,569 --> 00:32:54,154
And there's a stepbrother.

254
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:56,282
It's tough. The girl's a gypsy.

255
00:32:56,365 --> 00:33:00,912
I mean, she pops up on the grid
here and there, but it's chaotic at best.

256
00:33:01,037 --> 00:33:03,456
She paid some electric bills in Spain, '95.

257
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:06,584
Had a phone in her name
for three months in Belgium, '96.

258
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:09,171
No taxes, no credit.

259
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:12,216
I don't like her.
I want to go deep.

260
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:15,845
Get a phone log for Granny
and the half-brother.

261
00:33:15,928 --> 00:33:17,972
Anybody we can cross-file.

262
00:33:18,139 --> 00:33:21,309
I want to know every place she's slept
in the past six years.

263
00:33:22,435 --> 00:33:25,105
Have Paris get these out in the field.

264
00:33:53,177 --> 00:33:55,095
I'm not making this up.

265
00:33:56,305 --> 00:33:57,848
These are real.

266
00:34:04,939 --> 00:34:05,982
Okay.

267
00:34:06,066 --> 00:34:08,819
Who has a safety deposit box full of...

268
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,449
money and six passports and a gun?

269
00:34:16,035 --> 00:34:18,955
Who has a bank account number
in their hip?

270
00:34:20,289 --> 00:34:24,502
I come in here, and the first thing I'm
doing is I'm catching the sightlines...

271
00:34:24,586 --> 00:34:25,837
and looking for an exit.

272
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,173
I see the exit sign, too. I'm not worried.

273
00:34:29,132 --> 00:34:30,801
I mean, you were shot.

274
00:34:30,884 --> 00:34:34,596
People do all kinds of weird
and amazing stuff when they are scared.

275
00:34:41,104 --> 00:34:44,649
I can tell you the license plate numbers
of all six cars outside.

276
00:34:45,442 --> 00:34:47,444
I know that our waitress is left-handed...

277
00:34:47,527 --> 00:34:51,823
and the guy sitting at the counter
weighs 215 pounds and can handle himself.

278
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:55,661
I know the best place to look for a gun
is the cab of the grey truck outside.

279
00:34:55,744 --> 00:35:00,166
At this altitude, I can run flat out for
a half-mile before my hands start shaking.

280
00:35:03,294 --> 00:35:05,338
Now why would I know that?

281
00:35:08,842 --> 00:35:11,094
How can I know that
and not know who I am?

282
00:35:52,806 --> 00:35:53,891
Hey.

283
00:35:56,435 --> 00:35:57,645
I slept.

284
00:36:00,064 --> 00:36:02,483
- I can't believe it.
- Yeah, well, you were tired.

285
00:36:02,567 --> 00:36:03,902
I haven't slept.

286
00:36:03,985 --> 00:36:07,197
Oh, here. For $20,000,
I like to throw in breakfast.

287
00:36:09,282 --> 00:36:11,076
Did you stop for gas?

288
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:16,040
You were pretty out of it.

289
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:24,674
So, do you think there's,
like, a family waiting for you?

290
00:36:26,801 --> 00:36:27,928
I don't know.

291
00:36:29,721 --> 00:36:31,431
I've thought about it.

292
00:36:40,441 --> 00:36:41,818
Is that it?

293
00:36:42,151 --> 00:36:43,236
104.

294
00:36:43,319 --> 00:36:45,905
Yeah, that's the address.
No, keep going. Keep going.

295
00:36:45,989 --> 00:36:49,618
- Okay. Where?
- Just take a left. Pull in over here.

296
00:36:49,951 --> 00:36:51,036
Okay.

297
00:37:05,635 --> 00:37:07,470
So, this is it, right?

298
00:37:07,554 --> 00:37:09,055
Yeah, I guess.

299
00:37:11,141 --> 00:37:13,685
God, I don't recognise any of this.

300
00:37:13,894 --> 00:37:15,646
Okay. I should go.

301
00:37:19,984 --> 00:37:21,152
Jason?

302
00:37:23,529 --> 00:37:26,533
Oh, God. The money. Right.

303
00:37:26,992 --> 00:37:28,285
Yeah.

304
00:37:28,952 --> 00:37:30,162
Here.

305
00:37:30,412 --> 00:37:32,080
Thank you. Okay.

306
00:37:32,998 --> 00:37:34,833
Thanks for the ride.

307
00:37:35,459 --> 00:37:36,710
Anytime.

308
00:37:43,176 --> 00:37:46,346
Well, you could come up.
I mean, or you can wait here.

309
00:37:46,429 --> 00:37:49,182
- I can go check it out. But you could wait.
- Oh, no, no.

310
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:50,809
You could wait.

311
00:37:51,476 --> 00:37:55,856
With you, you would probably
just forget about me if I stayed here.

312
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,694
How could I forget about you?

313
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:03,448
You're the only person I know.

314
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:09,538
Yeah. That's true.

315
00:38:24,721 --> 00:38:26,681
I guess you're not home.

316
00:38:38,558 --> 00:38:42,658
<font> Monsieur Bourne,
I was wondering... I haven't seen you.

317
00:38:43,162 --> 00:38:44,282
Uh, here I am.

318
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,359
I think I forgot my key.

319
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:04,389
Hello?

320
00:39:23,868 --> 00:39:26,162
Are you sure this is all yours?

321
00:39:26,705 --> 00:39:27,956
I guess.

322
00:39:50,522 --> 00:39:52,274
This is my kitchen.

323
00:40:10,001 --> 00:40:11,378
Any clues?

324
00:40:12,004 --> 00:40:14,298
I think I'm in the shipping business.

325
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:16,634
So it's all coming back?

326
00:40:22,682 --> 00:40:25,101
Do you mind if I use the bathroom?

327
00:40:26,728 --> 00:40:27,854
Sure.

328
00:40:29,022 --> 00:40:30,107
Okay.

329
00:40:55,134 --> 00:40:56,594
Yeah. Hello? Hello?

330
00:40:56,677 --> 00:41:00,056
Yes, sir, Hotel Regina, Paris.
How may I direct your call?

331
00:41:00,389 --> 00:41:02,600
- Yeah, you're in Paris?
- Yes, sir.

332
00:41:02,684 --> 00:41:06,104
I'm looking for a guest there.

333
00:41:06,187 --> 00:41:08,023
Uh! Jason Bourne.

334
00:41:08,106 --> 00:41:10,317
- One moment, please.
- Thank you.

335
00:41:15,698 --> 00:41:18,534
I'm afraid I have no one
by that name registered.

336
00:41:20,328 --> 00:41:22,330
Okay. Thank you.

337
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:25,208
Wait! No, no. Are you there? Hello?

338
00:41:25,291 --> 00:41:26,334
Sir?

339
00:41:26,418 --> 00:41:29,129
Can you check
another name for me, please?

340
00:41:29,504 --> 00:41:31,423
Here, bear with me one second.

341
00:41:35,636 --> 00:41:39,181
John Michael Kane. Kane with a "K."
One moment, sir.

342
00:41:39,265 --> 00:41:40,600
Thank you.

343
00:41:48,942 --> 00:41:51,904
You call about Monsieur Kane?
John Michael Kane?

344
00:41:52,196 --> 00:41:53,864
Yeah, that's right.

345
00:41:53,947 --> 00:41:56,992
- You are a friend of his?
Uh, uh-huh. Yep.

346
00:41:58,536 --> 00:42:00,872
I have some very bad news for you, sir.

347
00:42:00,955 --> 00:42:06,461
I'm terribly sorry to tell you this, but Monsieur
Kane has passed away almost two weeks ago.

348
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,631
There was an accident. On the motorway.

349
00:42:09,715 --> 00:42:12,176
Apparently, he was killed instantly.

350
00:42:12,259 --> 00:42:15,220
Really, I'm terribly sorry
to be the one to tell you this.

351
00:42:16,889 --> 00:42:20,685
When they came for his things,
it was made known for us, you see?

352
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:22,103
Who came?

353
00:42:22,228 --> 00:42:23,646
His brother.

354
00:42:23,855 --> 00:42:27,776
Did his brother leave a number
or a way to get in touch with him?

355
00:42:27,943 --> 00:42:29,361
I think not.

356
00:42:30,779 --> 00:42:32,322
No, I'm sorry.

357
00:42:54,888 --> 00:42:57,475
Jason? There's no hot water.

358
00:42:57,558 --> 00:42:59,101
It's freezing.

359
00:42:59,644 --> 00:43:02,814
I'll go try the water in the kitchen.

360
00:43:02,897 --> 00:43:07,152
Why don't you just stay in the bathroom?
I'll see if I can get it hot.

361
00:43:11,281 --> 00:43:13,826
Yeah, it's really cold in here, too.

362
00:43:23,962 --> 00:43:25,922
The water is still cold.

363
00:43:28,049 --> 00:43:31,887
Yeah, it's cold in the kitchen, too.
I got it running, though.

364
00:43:35,307 --> 00:43:36,517
So...

365
00:43:43,441 --> 00:43:44,567
What?

366
00:43:46,695 --> 00:43:47,946
Nothing.

367
00:43:50,032 --> 00:43:51,366
Are you okay?

368
00:43:52,618 --> 00:43:53,744
Yeah.

369
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:08,426
What is it?

370
00:44:10,178 --> 00:44:11,805
Something wrong?

371
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:49,596
Jason!

372
00:45:51,455 --> 00:45:53,874
Open that. Tell me what's inside.

373
00:45:54,041 --> 00:45:55,417
Who are you?

374
00:45:57,086 --> 00:45:58,462
Who are you?

375
00:46:00,381 --> 00:46:01,799
Who are you?

376
00:46:05,303 --> 00:46:06,721
Oh, my God.

377
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:10,726
God.

378
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,103
Answer me! Who are you?

379
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,314
- He's got my picture!
- All right. Hang on.

380
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:17,837
- This is Zurich, yesterday!
- No, no, no! Don't...

381
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,527
I don't know. Where did you get this?

382
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,196
- Stay there.
- How did you get my picture?

383
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,324
Where did you get this from?

384
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:26,576
How did you get my... My God!

385
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:30,497
I'll do this! You stay there. Stay there!

386
00:46:46,014 --> 00:46:50,060
- Where are your shoes? Get your shoes.
- Sure. Yeah, sure.

387
00:46:51,311 --> 00:46:53,897
He went out the window.
Why would someone do that?

388
00:46:53,981 --> 00:46:56,400
We can't stay here. It's not safe.

389
00:46:56,483 --> 00:47:00,196
I can get us out of here, but we got to go.
We got to go right now.

390
00:47:03,116 --> 00:47:05,577
Okay, look, you can wait.

391
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:08,121
You can wait for the cops. It's okay.

392
00:47:08,246 --> 00:47:11,708
You just wait for them to get here.
But I can't. I got to go.

393
00:47:13,669 --> 00:47:14,837
Marie?

394
00:47:18,049 --> 00:47:19,216
Marie?

395
00:47:26,766 --> 00:47:28,393
Quiet. Be quiet.

396
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:40,907
Don't look.

397
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:55,839
Code in.

398
00:47:55,965 --> 00:47:58,384
Alpha 37509.

399
00:48:00,845 --> 00:48:01,929
Yeah.

400
00:48:08,103 --> 00:48:09,104
Hang on.

401
00:48:09,187 --> 00:48:11,187
Bourne, he went to Paris.
He went to the apartment.

402
00:48:11,189 --> 00:48:14,735
- We got him? Tell me.
- He killed our man.

403
00:48:14,902 --> 00:48:16,662
- What? In the apartment?
- Yeah.

404
00:48:17,071 --> 00:48:20,449
- Well, you got to clean that up.
- No, I can't clean it up.

405
00:48:20,575 --> 00:48:22,577
- There's a body in the street.
- So?

406
00:48:22,827 --> 00:48:24,454
There's police. This is Paris.

407
00:48:24,537 --> 00:48:27,624
Put up the scanners.
Get as much radio information as you can.

408
00:48:30,502 --> 00:48:32,379
Okay, you stay here.

409
00:48:32,588 --> 00:48:35,925
I'm gonna go find a place for this money.
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

410
00:50:00,349 --> 00:50:02,769
Hey, I told you to stay in the car.

411
00:50:08,108 --> 00:50:11,153
Jesus Christ. I told you
to stay in the car.

412
00:50:12,529 --> 00:50:14,782
I needed a drink.
I didn't think you would come back.

413
00:50:14,865 --> 00:50:17,076
Look, you got to go to the cops.

414
00:50:17,159 --> 00:50:19,412
Right now.
You got to go before this gets any worse.

415
00:50:19,495 --> 00:50:21,497
- By myself?
- It's gonna be okay.

416
00:50:21,581 --> 00:50:24,501
You're gonna take my passport, okay?
You show this to them.

417
00:50:24,667 --> 00:50:26,753
You have that picture,
you have the $20,000.

418
00:50:26,836 --> 00:50:29,673
You tell them everything that happened.
They'll believe you.

419
00:50:29,756 --> 00:50:31,383
They have to believe you.

420
00:50:34,553 --> 00:50:38,307
Marie, you can't just sit here.
It's not safe here.

421
00:50:38,516 --> 00:50:41,060
Safe?
This is from inside the embassy.

422
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:44,105
- Who can do this? This is from yesterday.
- I don't know.

423
00:50:44,188 --> 00:50:48,193
- How can they know we're together?
- I'm trying to do the right thing.

424
00:50:48,318 --> 00:50:49,820
- That's all.
- Right?

425
00:50:49,903 --> 00:50:52,364
How'll you make this right
by sending me there alone?

426
00:50:52,447 --> 00:50:54,658
You think I want you to go to the cops?
That's good?

427
00:50:54,742 --> 00:50:56,660
- You want to go, fine.
- If you go, I run!

428
00:50:56,744 --> 00:50:59,330
- You tell them what happened!
- I don't know what happened!

429
00:50:59,413 --> 00:51:01,749
I don't know who this guy was
or about that picture!

430
00:51:01,833 --> 00:51:03,710
I don't know who I am!

431
00:51:10,842 --> 00:51:11,927
Look, I'm...

432
00:51:12,135 --> 00:51:15,306
You think I'm trying to burn you.
I'm trying to do the right thing.

433
00:51:15,389 --> 00:51:17,308
Nobody does the right thing.

434
00:51:25,442 --> 00:51:28,403
Look, I can't run with you. I can't.

435
00:51:30,781 --> 00:51:34,994
We run, I got to live like this. I got to...
I don't even know who I'm hiding from.

436
00:51:35,244 --> 00:51:37,037
These people know who I am.

437
00:51:37,121 --> 00:51:40,541
Yeah, I got to stay here.
I got to figure this out.

438
00:51:40,708 --> 00:51:42,377
So figure it out.

439
00:52:00,605 --> 00:52:02,565
You take care of this car?

440
00:52:02,815 --> 00:52:03,942
What do you mean?

441
00:52:04,025 --> 00:52:06,820
The tires felt a little splashy
on the way over here.

442
00:52:07,112 --> 00:52:09,448
It pulls a little to the right.

443
00:52:30,846 --> 00:52:32,598
Last chance, Marie.

444
00:53:56,272 --> 00:53:57,273
So...

445
00:53:57,648 --> 00:54:00,401
- What?
- We got a bump coming up.

446
00:54:33,729 --> 00:54:36,440
Turn your head away. Turn your head away.

447
00:56:47,707 --> 00:56:49,709
We can never come back to this car.

448
00:56:50,168 --> 00:56:51,712
You understand?

449
00:56:51,878 --> 00:56:56,175
Okay, we're gonna clean it out,
and I'll wipe it down, and we walk away.

450
00:56:56,258 --> 00:56:57,885
- That's it.
- Okay.

451
00:56:58,010 --> 00:57:01,722
Okay. And I'll find a place for us to rest.
And I got to think.

452
00:57:01,848 --> 00:57:04,017
Do you have a hat or a scarf or something?

453
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:06,561
- For my hair?
- Yeah. Just until we can change it.

454
00:57:06,728 --> 00:57:08,188
Yeah. Sure. Okay.

455
00:57:08,271 --> 00:57:09,439
Okay.

456
00:57:17,408 --> 00:57:20,194
Shh! Shush! Shh!
Hush up.

457
00:57:20,262 --> 00:57:22,287
Shh! Shh!

458
00:57:26,503 --> 00:57:29,028
Monsieur Kane.
Monsieur Kane.

459
00:57:29,105 --> 00:57:31,300
Ah, Monsieur Kane.

460
00:57:47,647 --> 00:57:49,107
It's not him.

461
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:53,070
This man was not shot.

462
00:58:13,717 --> 00:58:14,968
What do you have?

463
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:17,388
Wombosi went to the morgue.

464
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:19,473
He saw the body. He didn't buy it.

465
00:58:21,392 --> 00:58:22,560
Where is he now?

466
00:58:22,935 --> 00:58:25,063
I told you, I'm
not staffed for this.

467
00:58:25,146 --> 00:58:27,399
Where is he? Right now!
Where's Wombosi?

468
00:58:27,524 --> 00:58:28,964
They were leaving the morgue.

469
00:58:29,234 --> 00:58:30,777
They just left.

470
00:58:37,493 --> 00:58:39,370
Sir, what do you want to do?

471
01:00:38,082 --> 01:00:40,334
I need to get the bottle.

472
01:02:11,934 --> 01:02:13,018
Hey.

473
01:02:23,446 --> 01:02:25,657
You already cleaned the room?

474
01:02:26,366 --> 01:02:29,453
I wiped the whole place down
for fingerprints.

475
01:02:32,748 --> 01:02:36,585
Can I walk around
or is it gonna leave any footprints?

476
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:45,303
You can walk around. It's no problem.

477
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:49,474
But we'll just keep track
of everything we touch.

478
01:02:50,058 --> 01:02:53,270
I think it's best if we leave a room,
that we don't leave a trail.

479
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:54,897
Why? Where are we going?

480
01:02:55,022 --> 01:02:57,900
I need to go to the hotel
where John Michael Kane stayed.

481
01:02:57,983 --> 01:02:59,527
The Hotel Regina.

482
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:04,032
If I was him,
then they're gonna have some records.

483
01:03:04,449 --> 01:03:06,242
We need that hotel bill.

484
01:03:06,326 --> 01:03:07,369
Okay.

485
01:03:07,786 --> 01:03:10,414
It gets slightly complicated, though.

486
01:03:11,331 --> 01:03:13,083
Because you're dead.

487
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,170
Right.

488
01:03:20,883 --> 01:03:23,970
- Please.
- They want war, we'll make war.

489
01:03:24,053 --> 01:03:27,515
If they want to kill me,
they better kill me the first time.

490
01:03:27,641 --> 01:03:31,061
They better kill me dead.
They better kill me when I'm in my sleep.

491
01:03:31,144 --> 01:03:33,480
Listen to me.
We need these people.

492
01:03:33,772 --> 01:03:36,275
It's hard enough getting people
that we know to help us.

493
01:03:36,358 --> 01:03:37,777
We must be careful.

494
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:38,944
We?

495
01:03:39,612 --> 01:03:40,613
No, you.

496
01:03:40,821 --> 01:03:43,533
You need to bring me back
that bastard kid's head...

497
01:03:43,616 --> 01:03:47,162
put it in front of this house,
and show them the war we're fighting.

498
01:03:47,245 --> 01:03:48,580
But that is precisely...

499
01:03:54,169 --> 01:03:55,546
Nykwana!

500
01:04:06,766 --> 01:04:10,103
We'll give the watch
a reference check before we go.

501
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:13,106
Okay.

502
01:04:15,484 --> 01:04:17,653
What's the pay phone number?

503
01:04:18,154 --> 01:04:20,406
616-2468.

504
01:04:20,531 --> 01:04:21,699
Exits?

505
01:04:21,866 --> 01:04:23,117
There's three.

506
01:04:23,326 --> 01:04:27,497
Service at the back,
side goes to the street past the shops...

507
01:04:27,872 --> 01:04:29,541
front is the best.

508
01:04:29,791 --> 01:04:33,670
If I think I'm being followed, I walk out
with the bag over my right shoulder.

509
01:04:33,754 --> 01:04:35,255
And if there's no taxi?

510
01:04:35,339 --> 01:04:39,010
I keep on walking,
don't look back until you make contact.

511
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:43,306
What?

512
01:04:47,602 --> 01:04:49,354
We need this, right?

513
01:04:52,232 --> 01:04:53,317
Okay.

514
01:05:04,537 --> 01:05:06,057
I need distances.

515
01:05:06,623 --> 01:05:09,417
You walk in, you pick a spot.
Some midpoint in the lobby.

516
01:05:09,835 --> 01:05:13,005
I want you to count your steps to that
spot and then remember that number.

517
01:05:13,088 --> 01:05:15,591
Because after I call you,
I can get you moving.

518
01:05:15,674 --> 01:05:17,176
You understand?

519
01:05:17,843 --> 01:05:19,178
I also need a head count.

520
01:05:19,261 --> 01:05:22,223
From the time you walk in
until you get to the desk.

521
01:05:22,306 --> 01:05:25,185
How many hotel employees are there?
And obviously security.

522
01:05:25,310 --> 01:05:27,520
And it might not be that
easy to see who they are.

523
01:05:27,687 --> 01:05:31,233
So I'll call you, you give me the layout,
and we'll take it from there.

524
01:05:35,821 --> 01:05:36,906
Regina.

525
01:05:36,972 --> 01:05:38,917
Yes, the house
phone in the lobby.

526
01:05:57,553 --> 01:05:59,180
- What happened?
- I...

527
01:05:59,305 --> 01:06:02,308
- Did something go wrong?
- I've got the records.

528
01:06:03,768 --> 01:06:06,688
He, this guy at the front desk
was smiling at me.

529
01:06:06,771 --> 01:06:10,609
So I thought, you know, all this trouble,
maybe it's easier to just ask for them.

530
01:06:10,692 --> 01:06:13,695
- You have the bill?
- He made me a photocopy.

531
01:06:15,197 --> 01:06:17,074
You just asked for it?

532
01:06:18,367 --> 01:06:21,454
I said I was Mr. Kane's personal assistant.

533
01:06:26,209 --> 01:06:28,503
Okay. That's good thinking.

534
01:06:37,972 --> 01:06:39,932
- Sir, can I...
- No.

535
01:06:43,478 --> 01:06:47,315
Wombosi was assassinated
in his house in the middle of Paris.

536
01:06:48,316 --> 01:06:50,110
Yeah, we just heard.

537
01:06:50,652 --> 01:06:53,781
It's him. It's Bourne.
We're almost positive.

538
01:06:53,906 --> 01:06:56,200
He had an assignment. He failed.

539
01:06:56,283 --> 01:06:59,328
He obviously felt compelled
to finish the task.

540
01:06:59,412 --> 01:07:00,288
Jesus.

541
01:07:00,371 --> 01:07:02,415
We think he'll come back in now.

542
01:07:03,041 --> 01:07:04,500
I mean, it's routine.

543
01:07:04,584 --> 01:07:06,419
It's like behavioural software.

544
01:07:08,171 --> 01:07:10,215
He's following a protocol.

545
01:07:10,590 --> 01:07:14,636
Now that he's completed the mission,
we think he'll come back in.

546
01:07:15,429 --> 01:07:16,972
They always do.

547
01:07:17,848 --> 01:07:18,974
When?

548
01:07:19,266 --> 01:07:21,352
How long till he checks in?

549
01:07:22,979 --> 01:07:24,272
- 24 hours.
- 24?

550
01:07:24,355 --> 01:07:26,441
Yeah, it's usually something like that.

551
01:07:28,276 --> 01:07:29,611
Then what?

552
01:07:30,696 --> 01:07:32,865
I told you we'd clean this up.

553
01:07:32,948 --> 01:07:34,616
It will be clean.

554
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:42,500
I understand you're a dive shop,
but where are you located?

555
01:07:44,043 --> 01:07:45,420
Marseilles?

556
01:08:09,946 --> 01:08:12,074
What specifically does
your company supply?

557
01:08:12,199 --> 01:08:15,327
I am sorry.
What is your name, monsieur?

558
01:08:23,424 --> 01:08:26,924
You've been here for three
hours and you still can't find a print?

559
01:08:35,641 --> 01:08:38,436
- What?
- Paris police found the vehicle.

560
01:08:51,491 --> 01:08:55,913
You've reached Simon Rawlins
at Alliance Security, Maritime Division.

561
01:08:55,996 --> 01:08:59,709
Paris office hours are
from 8.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m.

562
01:09:00,126 --> 01:09:02,003
I got a lead in Paris.

563
01:09:02,754 --> 01:09:05,423
The rest were Marseilles,
and two out in Southampton.

564
01:09:05,548 --> 01:09:07,926
- Paris? It's what?
- Alliance Security. Simon Rawlins.

565
01:09:08,009 --> 01:09:09,177
I got a machine.

566
01:09:34,413 --> 01:09:35,831
Mr. Kane?

567
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,418
Mr. Kane!

568
01:09:39,627 --> 01:09:43,381
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

569
01:09:47,469 --> 01:09:50,555
Mr. Kane. Come right in.
Please have a seat.

570
01:09:50,639 --> 01:09:52,015
Thank you.

571
01:09:52,432 --> 01:09:55,227
So, this is the Palmer Johnson tri-deck.

572
01:09:56,061 --> 01:09:59,857
I'm assuming you're still in the market.
It's still the same vessel?

573
01:10:00,733 --> 01:10:01,776
Yes.

574
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:26,803
So I'm Kane.

575
01:10:26,928 --> 01:10:28,769
- They...
- I had a meeting as Kane.

576
01:10:28,805 --> 01:10:30,557
- They said...
- No. I'm definitely Kane.

577
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:33,268
I just had a meeting as Kane
and he knew me as Kane.

578
01:10:33,352 --> 01:10:36,772
So I'm definitely Bourne.
I'm also just definitely Kane.

579
01:10:36,856 --> 01:10:37,898
It's all just boats.

580
01:10:37,982 --> 01:10:40,151
I got blueprints and cameras
and security systems.

581
01:10:40,234 --> 01:10:42,361
I just found John Michael Kane's body.

582
01:10:43,488 --> 01:10:45,114
In a morgue here in Paris.

583
01:10:45,281 --> 01:10:49,911
But if you are John Michael Kane,
whose body do they have?

584
01:10:58,003 --> 01:11:00,673
- What was the name again?
- Kane.

585
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:01,841
Kane.

586
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:03,259
John Michael Kane.

587
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:05,053
John Michael Kane.

588
01:11:10,308 --> 01:11:12,769
Kane. It's number 121.

589
01:11:14,396 --> 01:11:15,606
I want to see the body.

590
01:11:15,689 --> 01:11:18,984
Our boss could come back.
We are not supposed to do that.

591
01:11:19,944 --> 01:11:21,153
Come on.

592
01:11:37,004 --> 01:11:39,340
Is this it?
Wh-Where is he?

593
01:11:39,590 --> 01:11:41,050
I don't know.

594
01:11:42,521 --> 01:11:43,221
What's going on?

595
01:11:43,519 --> 01:11:46,089
This guy has come to see the American.
But the body has disappeared.

596
01:11:46,094 --> 01:11:47,924
They came yesterday evening... his brother.

597
01:11:48,062 --> 01:11:49,522
He's not in the register.

598
01:11:49,935 --> 01:11:51,478
Who are you? What's going on?

599
01:11:51,561 --> 01:11:54,690
- Where's the body that goes in here?
- I said someone came last night.

600
01:11:54,773 --> 01:11:56,400
I know. Where'd they take the body?

601
01:11:56,483 --> 01:11:58,694
Look, this is not a carnival, okay?

602
01:11:58,778 --> 01:12:01,572
People call, they make an appointment
and they follow the rules.

603
01:12:01,656 --> 01:12:04,868
Everyone signs in and out.
This is a serious place. Serious work.

604
01:12:04,951 --> 01:12:08,872
- It's not just to come in whenever you like!
- You're right. We didn't sign in.

605
01:12:08,955 --> 01:12:10,195
Get the hell out of here.

606
01:12:10,207 --> 01:12:13,001
- Fine. I'm just gonna go sign in.
- Okay, go.

607
01:12:16,297 --> 01:12:17,590
Is this it?

608
01:12:17,756 --> 01:12:20,051
- You can't take the book.
- This is it?

609
01:12:20,134 --> 01:12:22,637
It's okay. There's a pencil in here.
That's fine.

610
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:25,682
Honey, why don't you go wait outside?
Here it is.

611
01:12:25,765 --> 01:12:27,165
- We can't have...
- Okay.

612
01:12:29,186 --> 01:12:32,689
Jason, what just happened in there?
What are you looking for?

613
01:12:32,814 --> 01:12:34,441
Nykwana Wombosi.

614
01:12:34,691 --> 01:12:37,528
Wombosi went to the morgue to visit Kane.

615
01:12:38,612 --> 01:12:39,655
See?

616
01:12:40,197 --> 01:12:43,242
- So?
- He's in the Alliance brochure.

617
01:12:43,326 --> 01:12:44,577
Same guy.

618
01:12:44,744 --> 01:12:46,287
This guy knows.

619
01:13:18,823 --> 01:13:23,202
My French sucks. I can't...
It says something about a boat or...

620
01:13:24,954 --> 01:13:29,334
I don't understand. What does it say?
You read it. Tell me. What?

621
01:13:31,294 --> 01:13:35,132
It says that 3 weeks before he was killed,
Mr. Wombosi told police...

622
01:13:35,424 --> 01:13:39,220
that a man came onto his yacht,
five miles off the coast of Marseilles...

623
01:13:39,470 --> 01:13:41,347
and tried to kill him.

624
01:13:41,973 --> 01:13:45,602
It says that he chased the man off the boat
and shot him twice in the back.

625
01:13:47,228 --> 01:13:48,730
It says I'm an assassin.

626
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:30,880
Stop the car.

627
01:14:31,492 --> 01:14:33,792
But no... you said Rue de l...
we're almost there.

628
01:14:33,861 --> 01:14:35,591
Just right here, this is good.

629
01:14:35,663 --> 01:14:36,823
L said stop.

630
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:39,035
What's going on?

631
01:14:41,862 --> 01:14:42,830
What the hell are you doing?

632
01:14:42,914 --> 01:14:44,415
- Go. Go.
- What are...

633
01:14:45,959 --> 01:14:49,274
- We're blown. Come on.
- Blown? What is "blown"?

634
01:14:49,275 --> 01:14:51,310
Monsieur...
your change, your change.

635
01:14:51,344 --> 01:14:54,444
Sir, please... You can't stay here...
You have to leave.

636
01:14:55,761 --> 01:14:57,346
Keep walking.

637
01:14:57,888 --> 01:15:00,808
What do you think they're doing there?
They're onto the hotel.

638
01:15:00,892 --> 01:15:03,728
- No. You don't know that.
- Trust me. Just keep walking.

639
01:15:25,627 --> 01:15:28,213
Are you crazy? What are you doing now?

640
01:15:29,881 --> 01:15:31,049
Jason!

641
01:15:31,550 --> 01:15:33,093
This is blown.

642
01:15:41,561 --> 01:15:42,645
- Marie?
- Get away.

643
01:15:42,729 --> 01:15:44,939
- Stop right there.
- Get away from me.

644
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:46,816
What are you gonna do? Kill me?

645
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:48,234
- Marie.
- Is that what's next?

646
01:15:48,318 --> 01:15:50,445
Listen, stay calm. Stay calm.

647
01:15:50,779 --> 01:15:52,948
Whatever we do, we have to do it together.

648
01:15:53,031 --> 01:15:54,366
- We have to be...
- We?

649
01:15:54,450 --> 01:15:57,912
The only thing we had in common
was that neither of us knew who you were.

650
01:15:57,995 --> 01:15:59,914
- We've passed that now.
- Listen!

651
01:15:59,997 --> 01:16:03,418
The police'll find us. The people who took
the picture in the embassy...

652
01:16:03,501 --> 01:16:06,463
who killed Wombosi,
they're gonna come here and kill us.

653
01:16:06,546 --> 01:16:08,048
The people who you work for.

654
01:16:10,092 --> 01:16:14,304
I will take you wherever you need to go.
I'll take you there. I'll leave you there.

655
01:16:14,388 --> 01:16:16,932
You can do what you want.
You never have to see me again.

656
01:16:17,016 --> 01:16:19,560
But not here.
If we stay here, we die.

657
01:16:27,694 --> 01:16:30,530
Boy, great police work! Really brilliant!

658
01:16:30,989 --> 01:16:34,493
Why don't they just hang out a banner
that says, "Don't come back!"

659
01:16:35,828 --> 01:16:39,582
Jesus Christ!
What is the French word for "stakeout"?

660
01:16:47,090 --> 01:16:49,342
Okay, this was 16 minutes ago.

661
01:16:50,343 --> 01:16:52,471
This is our starting point.

662
01:16:52,679 --> 01:16:56,225
- Can't fly, trains are risky.
- Here.

663
01:16:56,308 --> 01:16:59,770
I need to know everything
Paris's finest is doing on this.

664
01:16:59,854 --> 01:17:01,022
I'm on it.

665
01:17:02,315 --> 01:17:04,943
You said 24 hours, and he's not back.

666
01:17:06,569 --> 01:17:09,364
No. But we got a good idea where he is.

667
01:17:10,157 --> 01:17:12,910
You've got a black ops agent
who's off the reservation.

668
01:17:12,993 --> 01:17:15,829
He trashed an American consulate.
He's on the run in Europe.

669
01:17:15,913 --> 01:17:18,958
You don't know why. I got to stand
before an oversight committee.

670
01:17:19,041 --> 01:17:20,751
What will I say about Treadstone?

671
01:17:20,835 --> 01:17:23,087
You're worried about a budget meeting?

672
01:17:23,338 --> 01:17:26,508
We don't take care of this,
we don't make it to the men's room.

673
01:17:27,342 --> 01:17:29,761
Now, is that clear enough for you?

674
01:17:29,886 --> 01:17:31,763
We will burn for this.

675
01:17:32,556 --> 01:17:34,558
We will both of us burn.

676
01:17:36,143 --> 01:17:39,855
All right, I want two teams.
Daryl, Ray, stay on the grids.

677
01:17:40,231 --> 01:17:42,233
Brian, Harris, Steve...

678
01:17:42,525 --> 01:17:44,277
I want to work on this girl.

679
01:17:44,444 --> 01:17:47,530
- And this residency pattern?
- We started it.

680
01:17:47,614 --> 01:17:48,490
Get it out.

681
01:17:53,036 --> 01:17:55,956
We cross-referenced numbers
from the grandmother and the stepbrother.

682
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:58,209
Whenever we found convergence, we back-checked
those numbers and ran a search merge...

683
01:17:58,292 --> 01:18:02,463
with any other data we had on her,
which wasn't much, but...

684
01:18:02,547 --> 01:18:03,923
Pins. These pins.

685
01:18:04,132 --> 01:18:07,427
These are all the places we think
she's lived in the last six years.

686
01:18:07,969 --> 01:18:10,722
One, two, three, four, five.

687
01:18:10,931 --> 01:18:12,558
That's our pool.

688
01:18:18,189 --> 01:18:19,565
No answer.

689
01:18:20,066 --> 01:18:22,068
How many times you let it ring?

690
01:18:22,485 --> 01:18:25,905
- Look, if you don't want to go, I'll hitch.
- I said I'd take you.

691
01:18:28,033 --> 01:18:29,910
Those are the targets.

692
01:18:30,327 --> 01:18:34,998
Beg, borrow, hack, tap, bypass!
I don't care what you do!

693
01:18:35,708 --> 01:18:40,004
I want to know everything you can tell me
about what's going on at those locations.

694
01:18:58,232 --> 01:19:00,276
How do you know
he still owns this?

695
01:19:01,819 --> 01:19:04,989
Eamon always had money.
He would never sell this.

696
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:36,148
Marie?

697
01:19:36,231 --> 01:19:37,358
What?

698
01:19:39,276 --> 01:19:40,736
We got to go.

699
01:19:41,445 --> 01:19:42,530
What?

700
01:19:42,822 --> 01:19:44,282
We got to go.

701
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:49,329
I thought it would...

702
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:57,880
- Shit, that's Eamon. I'll talk to him.
- We're leaving.

703
01:20:01,342 --> 01:20:04,095
Eamon. Surprise.

704
01:20:04,178 --> 01:20:07,474
It's me, Marie. Wow, God...

705
01:20:08,266 --> 01:20:10,435
there's a really good reason for this.

706
01:20:10,644 --> 01:20:12,229
There bloody well better be.

707
01:20:12,312 --> 01:20:14,940
- Daddy!
- Hang on. Hang on.

708
01:20:17,443 --> 01:20:19,779
I had no idea you would be here.

709
01:20:20,112 --> 01:20:23,074
Well, why would I be here?
It's only my bloody house, right?

710
01:20:23,950 --> 01:20:24,993
Yeah.

711
01:20:26,327 --> 01:20:27,996
Did she get you into this?

712
01:20:29,831 --> 01:20:31,458
It was just gonna be for a day.

713
01:20:31,541 --> 01:20:34,128
Daddy, Alain has to go pee!

714
01:20:35,087 --> 01:20:38,007
All right, all right, come on. Here.
Get out of the car.

715
01:20:39,425 --> 01:20:41,052
Okay, in you go.

716
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:42,845
Come on, Alain.

717
01:20:44,305 --> 01:20:45,390
I'm sorry. I...

718
01:20:45,473 --> 01:20:48,226
I thought it would be okay.
But I guess I was wrong.

719
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:49,853
- Let's find Mummy.
- Mummy?

720
01:20:50,270 --> 01:20:52,314
Mummy is away for two days, thank God.

721
01:20:57,361 --> 01:20:59,363
You've got yourself all tied up here.

722
01:20:59,822 --> 01:21:00,907
Okay.

723
01:21:05,036 --> 01:21:06,538
What does he do for a living?

724
01:21:07,747 --> 01:21:09,332
He used to be in shipping.

725
01:21:12,294 --> 01:21:13,921
Is he good for you?

726
01:21:14,213 --> 01:21:15,714
Are you happy?

727
01:21:16,090 --> 01:21:18,300
You know me. I try too hard.

728
01:21:40,988 --> 01:21:43,906
Here you go.

729
01:21:44,046 --> 01:21:44,658
Sleep well.

730
01:21:44,742 --> 01:21:46,818
Good night.

731
01:21:48,429 --> 01:21:50,389
I'll sleep on the floor.

732
01:21:56,691 --> 01:21:59,152
- This was when?
- 11:45 a.m.

733
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:02,030
Which is definitely within
the driving range of Paris.

734
01:22:03,531 --> 01:22:05,617
The call came from a rest stop.

735
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:07,536
Yeah. What's this yellow pin?

736
01:22:07,619 --> 01:22:09,455
She spent two months there in 1997.

737
01:22:09,538 --> 01:22:11,373
Closest town is Riom.

738
01:22:13,667 --> 01:22:17,046
We took her family's phone records
and collated the international calls.

739
01:22:17,130 --> 01:22:18,965
They were in Paris at 2.00 a.m.

740
01:22:19,132 --> 01:22:22,010
They can't fly. The train's too dangerous.

741
01:22:22,093 --> 01:22:24,846
He knows better than to go anywhere
we might track him.

742
01:22:25,388 --> 01:22:26,932
So this is our best guess.

743
01:23:26,204 --> 01:23:29,374
- What are you doing?
- The kids. I was worried. I couldn't sleep.

744
01:23:29,458 --> 01:23:31,502
You'll wake them up. We got to go.

745
01:23:31,585 --> 01:23:33,546
I don't want to know who I am anymore.

746
01:23:33,629 --> 01:23:36,757
I don't care. I don't want to know.

747
01:23:39,218 --> 01:23:43,181
Come on. We'll talk about...
Everything I found out, I wanna forget.

748
01:23:43,723 --> 01:23:44,808
It's okay.

749
01:23:44,891 --> 01:23:47,144
I don't care who I am
or what I did.

750
01:23:48,729 --> 01:23:49,813
It's okay.

751
01:23:49,897 --> 01:23:51,273
We have this money.

752
01:23:52,691 --> 01:23:54,068
We can hide.

753
01:23:56,696 --> 01:23:59,490
Can we do that?
Is there any chance you can do that?

754
01:24:07,708 --> 01:24:09,126
I don't know.

755
01:24:14,548 --> 01:24:15,883
Come on.

756
01:24:23,308 --> 01:24:25,602
Here, boy! Here, boy!

757
01:24:28,564 --> 01:24:29,773
'Morning.

758
01:24:30,274 --> 01:24:32,401
Christ. You were up early.

759
01:24:32,985 --> 01:24:34,695
Bless you for making coffee.

760
01:24:43,663 --> 01:24:45,415
One night. You weren't kidding.

761
01:24:46,124 --> 01:24:47,584
For a change.

762
01:24:48,085 --> 01:24:49,962
He's not there either.

763
01:24:50,879 --> 01:24:53,674
- And you looked by the car?
- He's not anywhere.

764
01:24:54,675 --> 01:24:56,427
All right, let me get dressed.

765
01:24:56,510 --> 01:24:59,013
- Who?
- Bloody dog's gone missing.

766
01:24:59,180 --> 01:25:00,765
Does that happen a lot?

767
01:25:00,849 --> 01:25:03,310
What? That mutt?
Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.

768
01:25:03,393 --> 01:25:05,228
It's always something, right?

769
01:25:07,606 --> 01:25:09,358
Get in the basement.

770
01:25:09,650 --> 01:25:10,776
What?

771
01:25:11,735 --> 01:25:14,697
- Get everyone in the basement.
- What the hell are you talking about?

772
01:25:14,780 --> 01:25:18,201
You're in danger. Your family's in danger.
I don't have time to explain.

773
01:25:18,284 --> 01:25:20,203
- Wait a minute. What...
- Eamon.

774
01:25:20,328 --> 01:25:21,704
You should go.

775
01:25:21,788 --> 01:25:24,416
- What the hell have you done?
- It's not her. It's me.

776
01:25:24,499 --> 01:25:27,961
You need to get out of sight
and in the basement as quick as you can.

777
01:25:28,545 --> 01:25:29,755
Daddy.

778
01:25:34,844 --> 01:25:36,178
I'm sorry.

779
01:25:36,596 --> 01:25:37,889
Let's go.

780
01:25:56,367 --> 01:25:58,327
- The phone is dead.
- Yeah.

781
01:25:59,621 --> 01:26:02,123
Jason, who's out there? Who is it?

782
01:26:10,549 --> 01:26:12,927
Scheiße. Scheiße.

783
01:26:19,601 --> 01:26:21,060
What are you doing?

784
01:26:21,853 --> 01:26:23,104
Oh, no.

785
01:26:27,359 --> 01:26:30,446
We should never have come here.
I... These children...

786
01:26:30,529 --> 01:26:31,947
That's not gonna happen.

787
01:28:59,857 --> 01:29:02,694
Where is it? Where's the weapon?

788
01:29:06,323 --> 01:29:09,409
Who else is out here?
Who else? How many you got with you?

789
01:29:09,493 --> 01:29:11,120
I'm not gonna ask you again.

790
01:29:11,996 --> 01:29:13,956
I work alone. Like you.

791
01:29:16,667 --> 01:29:18,461
We always work alone.

792
01:29:18,836 --> 01:29:21,464
- What do you mean?
- Who are you? Rome?

793
01:29:21,548 --> 01:29:22,674
Paris?

794
01:29:24,843 --> 01:29:26,553
Treadstone, both of us.

795
01:29:26,636 --> 01:29:28,305
- Treadstone?
- Which one?

796
01:29:28,388 --> 01:29:29,973
Paris. I live in Paris.

797
01:29:30,057 --> 01:29:31,725
You get the headaches?

798
01:29:32,685 --> 01:29:33,686
Yeah.

799
01:29:33,769 --> 01:29:35,771
I get such bad headaches.

800
01:29:36,314 --> 01:29:38,691
You know at night
when you're driving a car?

801
01:29:38,775 --> 01:29:40,443
Maybe it's the headlights.

802
01:29:40,526 --> 01:29:42,278
What is Treadstone?

803
01:29:43,196 --> 01:29:45,323
Treadstone said pills.

804
01:29:47,159 --> 01:29:49,036
They said go to Paris.

805
01:29:49,286 --> 01:29:51,497
Is Treadstone in Paris?

806
01:29:53,749 --> 01:29:55,251
Look at this.

807
01:29:57,420 --> 01:29:59,380
Look at what they make you give.

808
01:30:24,324 --> 01:30:26,159
All right, all right.

809
01:30:26,326 --> 01:30:29,204
All right, Claudia,
get in the front and put your belt on.

810
01:30:29,288 --> 01:30:31,540
All right, we're gonna put you in the back.

811
01:30:31,624 --> 01:30:33,751
All right, get in the front, Claudia.

812
01:30:38,923 --> 01:30:40,967
I'm not waiting, Marie.

813
01:30:41,217 --> 01:30:43,053
- One minute, Eamon.
- I'm not waiting!

814
01:30:43,136 --> 01:30:44,763
Please!

815
01:30:45,847 --> 01:30:47,015
Take it.

816
01:30:47,099 --> 01:30:49,518
I took out $30,000.
The rest is yours.

817
01:30:50,519 --> 01:30:52,479
- That's it?
- That's all I got.

818
01:30:55,399 --> 01:30:56,901
No, that's not what I meant.

819
01:30:56,984 --> 01:31:01,531
This is not gonna stop, Marie.
You got to get out now. Away from me.

820
01:31:02,991 --> 01:31:05,494
You got to get out.
You got to start running.

821
01:31:06,036 --> 01:31:07,746
You get low, you stay low.

822
01:31:07,829 --> 01:31:09,706
No more friends. Nothing familiar.

823
01:31:12,042 --> 01:31:15,755
There's enough in there for you
to make a life. Any life.

824
01:31:15,838 --> 01:31:17,215
I'm out of here, Marie!

825
01:31:17,298 --> 01:31:18,383
Hey!

826
01:31:21,135 --> 01:31:23,513
Get in the car. You got to go.

827
01:31:29,102 --> 01:31:30,979
What are you gonna do?

828
01:31:31,814 --> 01:31:33,065
I'll end it.

829
01:31:33,816 --> 01:31:35,109
Go ahead.

830
01:31:36,777 --> 01:31:37,987
Please.

831
01:32:56,447 --> 01:32:58,032
Code in, please.

832
01:32:59,033 --> 01:33:00,285
Code in.

833
01:33:04,581 --> 01:33:05,832
Code in.

834
01:33:10,129 --> 01:33:11,547
Who is this?

835
01:33:17,345 --> 01:33:19,138
Who the hell are you?

836
01:33:22,809 --> 01:33:24,561
The man you sent is dead.

837
01:33:24,644 --> 01:33:27,022
So whoever this is, you
better start talking.

838
01:33:28,774 --> 01:33:29,942
Hello, Jason.

839
01:33:31,318 --> 01:33:33,279
So, what are we into now?

840
01:33:38,659 --> 01:33:42,122
Come on. It only goes two ways, Jason. Either
you come in and let us make this right...

841
01:33:42,247 --> 01:33:44,291
or we'll keep going
until we're satisfied.

842
01:33:44,374 --> 01:33:46,168
You mean until you kill me.

843
01:33:48,128 --> 01:33:50,714
I can't fix this
if I don't know what the problem is.

844
01:33:50,798 --> 01:33:53,425
So tell me what we're into,
and I'll do the best I can.

845
01:34:01,684 --> 01:34:04,229
Why don't you talk to Marie, Jason?

846
01:34:06,064 --> 01:34:09,985
- Let's ask Marie what she wants to do.
- I don't think she gives a shit.

847
01:34:10,068 --> 01:34:11,445
She's dead.

848
01:34:20,413 --> 01:34:22,916
I'm sorry to hear that.
How did that happen?

849
01:34:23,041 --> 01:34:24,960
She was slowing me down.

850
01:34:26,169 --> 01:34:28,922
Jason, listen. All we've been
doing right from... BOURNE: Enough.

851
01:34:29,006 --> 01:34:30,007
Enough.

852
01:34:31,342 --> 01:34:33,677
5:30 p.m. Paris.

853
01:34:33,886 --> 01:34:35,596
Today. Pont Neuf.

854
01:34:35,888 --> 01:34:38,307
You come alone. You walk to
the middle of that bridge.

855
01:34:38,433 --> 01:34:40,643
You take off your jacket. Face east.

856
01:34:40,727 --> 01:34:42,847
- I'll redial this number.
- Jason, wait!

857
01:34:52,740 --> 01:34:57,161
First flight out. Tell Nicky I'll call
from the car. Tell her to find Picot. Go.

858
01:35:00,123 --> 01:35:01,332
So...

859
01:35:02,041 --> 01:35:03,543
What are we gonna do?

860
01:35:03,752 --> 01:35:06,046
I told you I'd clean this up.
That's what I'm doing.

861
01:35:06,129 --> 01:35:07,798
Can you really bring him in?

862
01:35:08,757 --> 01:35:10,592
I think we're past that, don't you?

863
01:35:11,218 --> 01:35:12,845
Do you have a better idea?

864
01:35:12,928 --> 01:35:15,640
You've given me nothing
but a trail of collateral damage...

865
01:35:15,723 --> 01:35:18,101
from Zurich to Paris. I don't
think I could do much worse.

866
01:35:18,184 --> 01:35:21,020
Why don't you go upstairs
and book a conference room?

867
01:35:21,104 --> 01:35:23,481
Maybe you can talk him to death.

868
01:36:40,523 --> 01:36:43,485
The bus, the tour bus, second level.

869
01:36:44,819 --> 01:36:46,738
Negative on the target.

870
01:36:49,575 --> 01:36:51,702
- Position one?
- Negative.

871
01:36:51,827 --> 01:36:54,038
- Position two?
- Negative.

872
01:37:09,012 --> 01:37:11,598
Position three, motorcycle.

873
01:37:12,641 --> 01:37:13,976
Negative.

874
01:37:14,143 --> 01:37:15,186
Negative.

875
01:37:39,462 --> 01:37:40,547
Jason?

876
01:37:40,630 --> 01:37:44,551
I told you to come alone.
I guess that was too complicated.

877
01:37:44,634 --> 01:37:46,470
So try this.
I'm gone.

878
01:37:50,682 --> 01:37:51,684
Fuck.

879
01:37:58,733 --> 01:38:00,568
Get Nicky on the phone.

880
01:38:16,210 --> 01:38:17,253
Yeah?

881
01:38:17,336 --> 01:38:19,881
How long to wipe down the room
and move it?

882
01:38:19,964 --> 01:38:21,925
- Get rid of everything?
- Yeah.

883
01:38:22,634 --> 01:38:25,387
- Two to three hours.
- All right, get started.

884
01:38:32,519 --> 01:38:33,813
Listen, no breaks.

885
01:38:33,896 --> 01:38:36,774
Two men outside, one in the lobby.
And keep your eyes open.

886
01:38:39,444 --> 01:38:41,696
- Keep the truck?
- Keep the truck.

887
01:38:41,905 --> 01:38:44,991
I'm gonna close this unit down.
We'll move the gear in the truck.

888
01:39:02,260 --> 01:39:05,013
They were covering Spain, Malta, Morocco.

889
01:39:05,096 --> 01:39:07,683
Yes, all local police radio traffic.

890
01:39:07,766 --> 01:39:11,311
No, for northern Europe
we need an authorised directive. Yeah.

891
01:39:12,438 --> 01:39:15,733
Okay, they're on it. We'll have
a satellite download in 30 minutes.

892
01:40:25,267 --> 01:40:27,185
Where's your field box?

893
01:40:31,815 --> 01:40:34,610
- Where's your field box?
- It's right there.

894
01:40:35,486 --> 01:40:37,822
The whole system's gone haywire.

895
01:40:38,239 --> 01:40:40,491
That's this window right here.

896
01:40:40,825 --> 01:40:42,619
Dining room window?

897
01:40:44,287 --> 01:40:45,831
I don't get it.

898
01:40:47,958 --> 01:40:50,043
Dead. The phones are dead.

899
01:40:52,129 --> 01:40:53,547
It's Bourne, isn't it?

900
01:40:54,590 --> 01:40:55,967
Just quiet.

901
01:41:43,727 --> 01:41:45,395
You move, you die.

902
01:41:45,645 --> 01:41:46,688
Bourne.

903
01:41:47,064 --> 01:41:48,357
Gun down.

904
01:41:54,405 --> 01:41:55,406
In there.

905
01:41:57,200 --> 01:41:58,951
Okay, so what do you want...

906
01:41:59,077 --> 01:42:00,453
Treadstone.

907
01:42:00,995 --> 01:42:03,540
You better take a look around.
There's not much left.

908
01:42:03,623 --> 01:42:06,084
- Are you Treadstone?
- Am I Treadstone? Me?

909
01:42:06,168 --> 01:42:08,211
What the hell are you talking about?

910
01:42:08,295 --> 01:42:09,755
He's lost it.

911
01:42:09,963 --> 01:42:14,176
You better start filling in the blanks here!
'Cause I thought we were on the same side.

912
01:42:14,301 --> 01:42:15,511
Whose side is that?

913
01:42:15,636 --> 01:42:19,474
You don't know what you're doing, do you?
You don't have a goddamn clue!

914
01:42:19,807 --> 01:42:21,100
Who am I?

915
01:42:21,351 --> 01:42:23,311
You're U.S. government property!

916
01:42:23,436 --> 01:42:26,606
You're a malfunctioning $30 million weapon!

917
01:42:27,107 --> 01:42:29,026
You're a total goddamn catastrophe!

918
01:42:29,151 --> 01:42:32,196
And, by God, if it kills me,
you'll tell me how this happened.

919
01:42:32,321 --> 01:42:35,282
- Why are you trying to kill me?
- What happened in Marseilles?

920
01:42:35,783 --> 01:42:38,077
You sent me to kill Wombosi.

921
01:42:38,161 --> 01:42:41,206
Kill Wombosi?
Yeah, we can do that any time we want.

922
01:42:41,289 --> 01:42:43,667
I can send Nicky to do that,
for Christ's sake.

923
01:42:44,209 --> 01:42:47,045
Mr. Wombosi was supposed to be dead
three weeks ago.

924
01:42:47,129 --> 01:42:50,799
He was supposed to have died in a way
that the only possible explanation was...

925
01:42:50,883 --> 01:42:53,928
that he'd been murdered
by a member of his own entourage.

926
01:42:54,011 --> 01:42:55,805
I don't send you to kill.

927
01:42:55,930 --> 01:42:57,557
I send you to be invisible.

928
01:42:57,640 --> 01:42:59,892
I send you because you don't exist.

929
01:43:00,268 --> 01:43:02,395
I want to know what happened in Marseilles.

930
01:43:02,479 --> 01:43:05,273
I don't remember what happened
in Marseilles.

931
01:43:05,357 --> 01:43:08,026
Bullshit! This
is unacceptable, soldier.

932
01:43:08,110 --> 01:43:09,778
You hear me? You failed!

933
01:43:09,862 --> 01:43:11,321
- Unacceptable?
- You failed!

934
01:43:11,447 --> 01:43:15,117
- You failed and you're gonna tell me why!
- I can't tell you! I don't remember!

935
01:43:15,201 --> 01:43:18,287
You brought Kane to life.
You put together a meeting with Wombosi.

936
01:43:18,496 --> 01:43:21,124
You found the security company.
You broke into the office!

937
01:43:21,207 --> 01:43:25,003
For Christ's sake, you picked the yacht
as the goddamn strike point!

938
01:43:32,887 --> 01:43:34,722
You picked the boat.

939
01:43:34,805 --> 01:43:37,225
You picked the day. You tracked the crew.

940
01:43:37,308 --> 01:43:38,851
The food, the fuel!

941
01:43:38,935 --> 01:43:41,688
You told us where. You told us when.

942
01:43:42,272 --> 01:43:44,816
You hid out on that boat five days.

943
01:43:44,983 --> 01:43:47,569
You were in, Jason. You were in!

944
01:43:47,653 --> 01:43:49,154
It was over!

945
01:44:49,803 --> 01:44:51,597
No, you do remember.

946
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:55,977
Don't you?

947
01:45:02,358 --> 01:45:04,402
I don't want to do this anymore.

948
01:45:05,487 --> 01:45:08,031
I don't think that's a
decision you can make.

949
01:45:12,912 --> 01:45:15,581
Jason Bourne is dead.
Do you hear me?

950
01:45:15,998 --> 01:45:17,708
He drowned two weeks ago.

951
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,336
You're gonna go tell them Bourne is dead.
Understand?

952
01:45:20,420 --> 01:45:21,921
Where are you gonna go?

953
01:45:23,131 --> 01:45:27,010
I swear to God, if I even feel somebody behind me...
there is no measure to how fast...

954
01:45:27,094 --> 01:45:30,180
and how hard I will bring this fight
to your doorstep.

955
01:45:30,305 --> 01:45:32,224
I'm on my own side now.

956
01:49:07,207 --> 01:49:08,208
It's done.

957
01:49:09,167 --> 01:49:10,627
Shut it down.

958
01:49:48,752 --> 01:49:51,630
The Treadstone project
has already been terminated.

959
01:49:51,714 --> 01:49:54,925
It was designed primarily
as a sort of advanced game program.

960
01:49:55,009 --> 01:49:57,720
We'd hoped it might build
into a good training platform.

961
01:49:57,804 --> 01:50:01,391
But quite honestly,
for a strictly theoretical exercise...

962
01:50:01,474 --> 01:50:03,810
the cost-benefit ratio
was just too high.

963
01:50:03,893 --> 01:50:05,979
It's all but decommissioned at this point.

964
01:50:06,062 --> 01:50:07,647
All right, what's next?

965
01:50:07,731 --> 01:50:10,067
Okay, this is...

966
01:50:11,694 --> 01:50:12,903
Blackbriar.

967
01:50:12,987 --> 01:50:16,198
Blackbriar is a joint DOD
communications program...

968
01:50:16,282 --> 01:50:20,370
that we really feel has good traction to it.
It's got legs. It'll run and run.

969
01:50:20,453 --> 01:50:24,291
It combines elements of proactive
and reactive fields of security...

970
01:51:08,213 --> 01:51:09,840
This your store?

971
01:51:09,923 --> 01:51:11,050
Yeah.

972
01:51:12,509 --> 01:51:16,639
It's nice. It's a little
hard to find, but...

973
01:51:21,144 --> 01:51:22,937
Think I could rent a scooter?

974
01:51:27,067 --> 01:51:28,568
You have ID?

975
01:51:29,987 --> 01:51:31,363
Not really.

976
01:52:30,866 --> 01:52:32,925
?? Extreme ways are back again??

977
01:52:33,002 --> 01:52:35,562
?? Extreme places I didn't know??

978
01:52:35,638 --> 01:52:37,731
?? I broke everything new again??

979
01:52:37,807 --> 01:52:40,105
?? Everything that I'd owned??

980
01:52:40,176 --> 01:52:42,838
?? I threw it out the windows
came along??

981
01:52:42,912 --> 01:52:47,315
?? Extreme ways I know will
part the colors of my sea??

982
01:52:47,383 --> 01:52:49,977
?? Perfect color me??

983
01:52:50,052 --> 01:52:52,043
?? Extreme ways that help me??

984
01:52:52,121 --> 01:52:54,749
?? They help me out
late at night??

985
01:52:54,824 --> 01:52:56,951
?? Extreme places I had gone??

986
01:52:57,026 --> 01:52:59,392
?? But never seen any light??

987
01:52:59,462 --> 01:53:01,794
?? Dirty basements, dirty noise??

988
01:53:01,864 --> 01:53:04,424
?? Dirty places coming through??

989
01:53:04,500 --> 01:53:06,434
?? Extreme worlds alone??

990
01:53:06,502 --> 01:53:09,062
?? Did you ever like it planned??

991
01:53:09,138 --> 01:53:12,369
?? I would stand in
line for this??

992
01:53:13,642 --> 01:53:17,408
?? There's always room
in life for this??

993
01:53:18,647 --> 01:53:20,979
?? Oh, baby??

994
01:53:21,050 --> 01:53:22,915
?? Oh, baby??

995
01:53:22,985 --> 01:53:25,715
?? Then it fell apart??

996
01:53:25,788 --> 01:53:28,086
?? Fell apart??

997
01:53:28,157 --> 01:53:30,421
?? Oh, baby??

998
01:53:30,493 --> 01:53:32,461
?? Oh, baby??

999
01:53:32,528 --> 01:53:35,190
?? Then it fell apart??

1000
01:53:35,264 --> 01:53:37,732
?? It fell apart??

1001
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:40,200
?? Oh, baby??

1002
01:53:40,269 --> 01:53:42,066
?? Oh, baby??

1003
01:53:42,138 --> 01:53:44,800
?? Then it fell apart??

1004
01:53:44,874 --> 01:53:47,399
?? It fell apart??

1005
01:53:47,476 --> 01:53:49,706
?? Oh, baby??

1006
01:53:49,779 --> 01:53:54,648
?? Oh, baby
Like it always does??

1007
01:53:54,717 --> 01:53:57,242
?? Always does??

1008
01:53:57,319 --> 01:53:59,344
?? Extreme songs that told me??

1009
01:53:59,422 --> 01:54:01,686
?? They helped me
down every night??

1010
01:54:01,757 --> 01:54:04,021
?? I didn't have much to say??

1011
01:54:04,093 --> 01:54:06,493
?? I didn't get above the light??

1012
01:54:06,562 --> 01:54:08,757
?? I closed my eyes
and closed myself??

1013
01:54:08,831 --> 01:54:13,666
?? And closed my world
and never opened up to anything??

1014
01:54:13,736 --> 01:54:16,466
?? That could get me along??

1015
01:54:16,539 --> 01:54:18,507
?? I had to close
down everything??

1016
01:54:18,574 --> 01:54:20,906
?? I had to close down my mind??

1017
01:54:20,976 --> 01:54:23,171
?? Too many things to cover me??

1018
01:54:23,245 --> 01:54:25,679
?? Too much can make me blind??

1019
01:54:25,748 --> 01:54:28,239
?? I've seen so much
in so many places??

1020
01:54:28,317 --> 01:54:30,547
?? So many heartaches,
so many faces??

1021
01:54:30,619 --> 01:54:32,883
?? So many dirty things??

1022
01:54:32,955 --> 01:54:35,446
?? You couldn't even believe??

1023
01:54:35,524 --> 01:54:38,960
?? I would stand in
line for this??

1024
01:54:40,162 --> 01:54:43,791
?? It's always good
in life for this??

1025
01:54:45,100 --> 01:54:47,295
?? Oh, baby??

1026
01:54:47,369 --> 01:54:49,303
?? Oh, baby??

1027
01:54:49,371 --> 01:54:52,033
?? Then it fell apart??

1028
01:54:52,107 --> 01:54:54,541
?? It fell apart??

1029
01:54:54,610 --> 01:54:56,840
?? Oh, baby??

1030
01:54:56,912 --> 01:54:58,880
?? Oh, baby??

1031
01:54:58,948 --> 01:55:01,508
?? Then it fell apart??

1032
