1
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,700
Hi.

2
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,800
Hi.

3
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,600
My name is, Kent.
What's your name?

4
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,665
Daphne.

5
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,700
Daphne. That's a really beautiful name.

6
00:01:01,735 --> 00:01:03,665
It sounds like a
name of a flower.

7
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,700
Obviously I know that it's not a flower,
but it sounds like it could be.

8
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,600
I like flowers.

9
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,800
Smelling them, stuff like that.
Sending them to people, it's good.

10
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,700
Where are you from?

11
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,665
Connecticut.

12
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,565
Really? I'm a big fan of, Connecticut.

13
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,600
I'm a... Who isn't, right?
You're close enough to the city...

14
00:01:25,635 --> 00:01:27,565
...and you can really enjoy it.

15
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,665
But your also far enough that
you got a small town field.

16
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,700
- Did you go to school out there?
- Yeah, I did. I went to Wesslam.

17
00:01:32,735 --> 00:01:34,000
That's perfect, that's a great school.

18
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,500
- What's did you major in..?
- Psychology.

19
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,700
It's great.

20
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,700
Those are really beautiful
earrings, by the way.

21
00:01:40,735 --> 00:01:42,700
They do a nice job
of complementing your...

22
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:44,565
I'm gonna stop you right there.

23
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,100
Because on paper
you've done everything right.

24
00:01:47,135 --> 00:01:49,600
You've took an interest
in my personal history.

25
00:01:49,635 --> 00:01:51,600
You've complemented
my accessories.

26
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,800
Blah, blah, blah.

27
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,800
If we'd met in college, our relationship,
probably would've developed between us.

28
00:01:57,835 --> 00:02:00,600
Which I would have come to regret
because I would have found out...

29
00:02:00,635 --> 00:02:03,117
...that you're just as boring
and polite in the bedroom...

30
00:02:03,152 --> 00:02:05,600
...as you have been during
this, god awful conversation.

31
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,665
Okay, Daphne...

32
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,200
If I wanted a nice
sexual pen pal...

33
00:02:08,235 --> 00:02:09,700
...you'd be at the top of my list.

34
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,500
We'd just, I-chat all night long.
LOL. Tickles.

35
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,700
But unfortunately, that's
not what I'm looking for.

36
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
I want a man whose
hand doesn't shake...

37
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,500
...when he puts it up my shirt.
Do you know what I'm saying?

38
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,665
Okay.
Daphne, if I could just...

39
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,800
Save it, Kent.
I'm not looking for a BFF.

40
00:02:26,835 --> 00:02:28,600
Daphne, please.

41
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,600
Bitch, I'm talking to you!

42
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,800
- What did you call me?
- I didn't stutter.

43
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,600
Oh you sure can talk the talk,
you crazy little slut.

44
00:02:39,635 --> 00:02:41,600
But, can you
deliver the goodies?

45
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,600
I don't give a damn
about, Connecticut.

46
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,700
I hate those cheap buildings.

47
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,700
I'm from, North Dakota and this
is how we handle our business...

48
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,700
...in the vice and state, mamma.

49
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,765
Get your hands off me, right now.

50
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,600
Or I will take you to your knees
in front of this entire bar.

51
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,600
Promise?

52
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,700
Hold on, angel crossing!
Angel crossing!

53
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,500
Get on there. Here we
come. Watch out!

54
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,800
What a beautiful view.

55
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,800
So, this is where you live?

56
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,600
This is where you live
too, honey. Come on.

57
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,700
What do you think
about, Daphne?

58
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,700
- I really liked, Daphne.
- You did?

59
00:03:59,735 --> 00:04:01,565
- Yeah.
- Definitely naughty.

60
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,700
She's was a lot naughty,
but in the fun way.

61
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,700
What about, Kent,
did you like him?

62
00:04:05,735 --> 00:04:06,765
- Kent was hot.
- Really?

63
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,665
I like those glasses,
that was a nice touch.

64
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,800
You want to try fill in
the whole great planes vibe?

65
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,600
Like he was an angry
cowboy who drives a van.

66
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,700
- Hot.
- But also has ninja equipment...

67
00:04:15,735 --> 00:04:17,700
...back in his apartment.
A lot's happening.

68
00:04:17,735 --> 00:04:18,800
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

69
00:04:18,835 --> 00:04:20,565
Like a transformer.

70
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,500
- I'd like to meet, Kent again.
- Yeah, come here.

71
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,500
Toothpaste and all.

72
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,150
- I love you, Kate.
- I love you, Brad.

73
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,500
You are the best girl
in the whole world.

74
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,700
Let's get these off, of you.

75
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,600
That was fun.

76
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,800
- That feels good.
- It's the acupressure.

77
00:05:04,835 --> 00:05:06,800
- Oh really?
- No, I just like to rub it.

78
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,700
You know, this stuff is connected
to all different stuff inside your tummy.

79
00:05:10,735 --> 00:05:12,267
- I know that.
- I push the wrong thing...

80
00:05:12,302 --> 00:05:13,800
- You know what that's for?
- Not till later.

81
00:05:13,835 --> 00:05:14,800
Okay.

82
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,600
So when's the big day?

83
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,565
- Hmm.
- I'm sorry?

84
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,550
We're getting married in the
spring in, South Carolina.

85
00:05:22,585 --> 00:05:25,500
- Yeah, what about you guys?
- We're not getting married.

86
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,665
So, why do you take
the dance classes?

87
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,600
We do a lot of stuff together.
That's one of many thing we do together.

88
00:05:31,635 --> 00:05:32,600
Yeah, it's fun.

89
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,700
Can't think of what
we don't do together.

90
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:36,700
Right, so why wouldn't you
wanna get married?

91
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,650
- Yeah.
- We are happy.

92
00:05:38,685 --> 00:05:39,700
- We're happy.
- Yeah.

93
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,800
And I love her.
Marriage kind of brings pressure...

94
00:05:41,835 --> 00:05:43,665
...and stress and all kinds of stuff.

95
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,700
We don't want our relationship
to turn into work.

96
00:05:45,735 --> 00:05:47,700
We just wanna be together
'cause we enjoy it.

97
00:05:47,735 --> 00:05:49,500
Not because we have to, you know?.

98
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,800
There's a reason that they
use the expression:

99
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,500
"Tying the knot"
or "Ball and chain".

100
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,050
Have you ever listened to the
words of a wedding ceremony?

101
00:05:57,085 --> 00:05:59,500
Like: "I promise to obey. "
Or "Till death do us part. "

102
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
I'd rather be like stuck
on an island...

103
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,600
...with some weird millionaire,
hunting me and trying to kill me...

104
00:06:04,635 --> 00:06:05,700
...and trying to escape
than be involved...

105
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,800
...in something with those. That's like
a time bomb, waiting to explode.

106
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,800
So, what about children?
You do want to make them, no?

107
00:06:11,835 --> 00:06:13,565
- No, no.
- No.

108
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,700
- I don't wanna make them.
- Uh-uh.

109
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,700
I just don't want to be like,
responsible for this kid...

110
00:06:20,735 --> 00:06:22,267
...and hurt their feelings
and disappoint them.

111
00:06:22,302 --> 00:06:23,800
Yeah, that's what
happened to our families.

112
00:06:23,835 --> 00:06:25,765
We're both from
divorced families.

113
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,800
We've seen it play out. We don't
need to repeat the pattern.

114
00:06:28,835 --> 00:06:31,600
But anyway, congratulations
on getting married.

115
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,700
That sounds like a really cool
thing, and to each their own.

116
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
Yeah, absolutely.

117
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,800
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas!

118
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,500
Bye-bye.

119
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,500
- Big-bad Brad!
- Hi!

120
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,700
- How are you guys doing?
- Look at this. How are you?

121
00:07:06,735 --> 00:07:08,500
You remember
my girlfriend, Kate.

122
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,650
- How are you? Good to see you.
- Hi.

123
00:07:10,685 --> 00:07:13,092
What are you guys
doing for, christmas?

124
00:07:13,127 --> 00:07:15,500
We got the entire
family flying in.

125
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,600
13 airport pick-ups.

126
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,600
4 days of listening
to how gifted my nieces are.

127
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,600
My brother thinks his daughter,
the four year old...

128
00:07:25,635 --> 00:07:27,500
...is gonna be the next, Beyonce.

129
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,600
She's bad and she sucks.

130
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,700
I'm vacationing in tropical
Albany this year...

131
00:07:37,735 --> 00:07:39,565
...with, Tricia's family.

132
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,150
They got us a cot,
which is awesome.

133
00:07:41,185 --> 00:07:42,665
But we'll probably end up sleeping...

134
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,800
...on the musty couch
in the basement with the cats.

135
00:07:44,835 --> 00:07:46,565
All seven of them.

136
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,600
We'll get to be there
the whole week.

137
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,765
Sounds like
a prison sentence.

138
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,200
Why do you guys put
yourselves through that?

139
00:07:53,235 --> 00:07:55,600
It's, christmas, right,
don't you have to?

140
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,250
We don't need to do it.

141
00:07:57,285 --> 00:07:58,765
We don't.
We don't do it.

142
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,765
- We're done.
- Why, what are you doing?

143
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,500
- We're going to Fiji. Just the two of us.
- Yeah.

144
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,500
Fiji?

145
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,565
Yeah.

146
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,765
Don't your families
get upset?

147
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,800
Not if you tell them
you're doing charity work.

148
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,500
Like building houses
in third world countries.

149
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,600
Teaching english as a second
language in, Puerto Rico.

150
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,600
Helping orphans in, Somalia.

151
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,600
Helping, Chinese kids capture lobsters.

152
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,600
Boil them, cut them, clean the
weird stuff out the middle.

153
00:08:23,635 --> 00:08:25,700
We find it that the more
details you give...

154
00:08:25,735 --> 00:08:27,700
...kinda throws them off the set.

155
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,650
You lie to your families
at, christmas time?

156
00:08:30,685 --> 00:08:33,500
You really can't spell
families without lies.

157
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,700
Try it.

158
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,800
But don't you
ever feel guilty?

159
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,600
For taking a vacation
on our vacation?

160
00:08:40,635 --> 00:08:41,565
No, not really.

161
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,500
- You do look pretty sexy with a tan.
- Thanks, babe.

162
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,600
You could take this one.
This one here.

163
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,600
- Like that.
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

164
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,800
Oh by the way I made a couple's
massage reservation for this weekend.

165
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,600
- You did? That's great.
- Yeah.

166
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,800
I should probably check
us in online, after this.

167
00:09:01,835 --> 00:09:02,765
I did it.

168
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,665
You checked us in already?
You're the best, sweetheart.

169
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,600
I picked up a pair of those noise
canceling headphones, you wanted.

170
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,700
- You did not.
- For the next time.

171
00:09:10,735 --> 00:09:12,700
- Oh my God.
- I'm excited.

172
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,600
We should probably sign up for
the scuba boat as soon as we get there...

173
00:09:16,635 --> 00:09:18,500
I heard it fills up
really quick.

174
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,600
Do you feel like we've
been on this vacation before?

175
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,200
The scuba diving, we did that
in Bali and Costa Rica.

176
00:09:25,235 --> 00:09:28,700
Yeah, but this is Fiji.
We've never been to Fiji.

177
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,700
That's a whole different island.
and the resort there is beautiful,

178
00:09:32,735 --> 00:09:35,600
and the scuba diving
there's gonna be totally different.

179
00:09:35,635 --> 00:09:37,500
It's different water different fish.

180
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,650
It's gonna be really good.
I'm excited.

181
00:09:39,685 --> 00:09:41,692
- It's gonna be amazing.
- Are you excited?

182
00:09:41,727 --> 00:09:43,700
- I am. I'm really excited.
- I am excited.

183
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,700
- I love you.
- I love you too.

184
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,700
Hey, Mom, merry, christmas.

185
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,700
Yeah.

186
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,700
Listen. Actually I'm sorry
I didn't call you sooner.

187
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,800
We're actually heading
out today to, Burma.

188
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,800
Yeah. That's exactly
the island in, Asia, Burma.

189
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,800
We're inoculating babies there.

190
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,700
Yeah, we'll be helping
out with these kids.

191
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,765
It's such a great cause, but honestly...

192
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,565
it just sucks that we're not able to
be there with you and the entire family.

193
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,700
You know how much. I know, mom it's been
three years since I've been there for, christmas.

194
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,700
I wish I would've
called you sooner.

195
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,600
But, Kate sent all
the gifts and stuff to you.

196
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,600
Okay.

197
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,600
That's Merry Christmas
in Burmese.

198
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,700
All right, I'll tell her.
I love you too. Bye.

199
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,700
You learned "Merry Christmas" in, Burmese.

200
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,600
I gotta take everything
to the next level.

201
00:10:53,635 --> 00:10:55,700
Come on, let's do this.
I'm excited.

202
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,600
Attention, San Francisco
passengers.

203
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,700
All flights
have been grounded...

204
00:11:22,735 --> 00:11:24,600
...due to extreme
weather conditions.

205
00:11:24,635 --> 00:11:25,565
Sir, excuse me.

206
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,800
Well the phone's will be in
and your flight's not going out.

207
00:11:27,835 --> 00:11:30,667
But what I can do
is get you set up for standby...

208
00:11:30,702 --> 00:11:33,500
...on the first flight
to Fiji tomorrow. Okay?

209
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,665
Tomorrow's not going to be great for us.

210
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,765
We've already scheduled
a couple's massage...

211
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,700
I'm sorry, sir. I don't make
the fog, I deal with it.

212
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,600
The best I can do is get you
guys set up a suite at the, Radisson.

213
00:11:43,635 --> 00:11:46,600
They have lovely accommodations,
it's right next to the airport.

214
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,650
You promise?
At the, Radisson?

215
00:11:48,685 --> 00:11:50,600
- Did you hear that?
- Brad.

216
00:11:50,635 --> 00:11:51,565
No, no that's terrific.

217
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,600
Would it be possible
to take us out...

218
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,600
and get us, McDonald's as desert?

219
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,565
I'll start missing
flights more often.

220
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,600
With this kind of
red carpet service is available.

221
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,600
- Because that's terrific. A suite.
- Brad, please.

222
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,565
That's not helping, Brad, okay.
Is there another airline...

223
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,700
that you're possibly affiliated with?
Like a sister airline that we can transfer to?

224
00:12:07,735 --> 00:12:10,700
- No, I'm sorry.
- Do you have a cousin airline?

225
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,700
How about an airline that
your airline's filled out before?

226
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,700
The FAA has ruled that the, Bay
area fog is simply too thick.

227
00:12:17,735 --> 00:12:20,700
No flights are coming in
and no flights are going out...

228
00:12:20,735 --> 00:12:22,665
until at least tomorrow morning.

229
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,100
Let's see how travelers
are coping in all of this chaos.

230
00:12:26,135 --> 00:12:29,500
We have a couple over here.
Excuse me, sir? Excuse me.

231
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,500
Where are you headed
for this, christmas?

232
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,500
We're live on the air.

233
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,700
You certainly look
dressed for a vacation.

234
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,700
We're taking...
And we take the trips.

235
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,665
We'll take a different trip.

236
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,800
What he's trying to say is
that we plan a trip every year.

237
00:12:53,835 --> 00:12:56,500
This is actually
ruining our Christmas.

238
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,700
You must be pretty upset.
Are you visiting friends and family?

239
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,800
This is, Kate.

240
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,700
Hi, mom.

241
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,150
I know, mom. All the flights
were cancelled for today.

242
00:13:10,185 --> 00:13:12,392
- But they're not really...
- Sweetheart It's, my dad.

243
00:13:12,427 --> 00:13:14,600
They're not sure,
whether or not if it'll be today.

244
00:13:14,635 --> 00:13:16,700
You want me to answer it?
Do I answer or no?

245
00:13:16,735 --> 00:13:18,500
Do I pick it up or not?

246
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,765
Yes, I know. I understand
you have feelings.

247
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,600
What? What do you want me to do? I don't know
what this means, I don't know what your saying to me.

248
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,650
Alright he's gonna give you a big
hug when he see's you, mom.

249
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,700
- I'm not hugging anybody.
- He's really excited about the hug.

250
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,700
- Alright we'll see you at noon.
- Noon?

251
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,650
Kate, are you crazy?
Did you just commit us to go?

252
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:42,142
What did you want me to say?
They saw us on the news.

253
00:13:42,177 --> 00:13:44,600
We're obviously not
inoculating babies in, Burma.

254
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,800
- No...
- We are stuck here.

255
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,765
By the way, what did you say to your dad?

256
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,700
I told my dad that of course
we'll be going over there.

257
00:13:50,735 --> 00:13:52,600
Don't compare
your situation.

258
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,200
- You kidding?
- There's new stuff...

259
00:13:54,235 --> 00:13:55,665
...that you're missing here, Kate.

260
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,500
My Dad's a unique specific
animal. Your mother's not.

261
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,800
My dad, your mom.
My mom, your dad.

262
00:14:00,835 --> 00:14:01,765
Great.

263
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,500
We'll see all four families in one day, Kate.

264
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,700
Do you have any idea what this means?
Do you have any idea what you committed us to?

265
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,700
I know exactly
what this means.

266
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,800
Brad.

267
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,600
Baby.

268
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,600
I don't want to fight.

269
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,765
Honey, I don't wanna fight either.

270
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,600
- I hate this.
- We never fight, honey. I'm sorry.

271
00:14:34,635 --> 00:14:35,600
I love you.

272
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,700
This is what our families do, you
know that? This is what happens.

273
00:14:39,735 --> 00:14:42,167
My mother makes me crazy
every time I talk to her.

274
00:14:42,202 --> 00:14:44,401
You're absolutely right.
Here's all we got to do.

275
00:14:44,436 --> 00:14:46,600
We just gotta get through these, Four Christmases...

276
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,765
as quickly and as painlessly as possible.

277
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,800
Exactly. Promise me that no
matter what happens today...

278
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,800
we'll still have each other, right.

279
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,500
- Honey, of course we will.
- Okay.

280
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,600
Hey listen. If one of these
houses gets a little too intense...

281
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,665
- I think we're gonna need a exit strategy.
- Yes.

282
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,600
We'll need a word that both of us know
that means it's time to leave.

283
00:15:14,635 --> 00:15:16,600
What do you think our
safe word, should be?

284
00:15:16,635 --> 00:15:17,765
It's a good idea.
Mistletoe.

285
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,800
- Mistletoe is really good.
- Okay.

286
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,500
By the way, my father's house
can get particularly uncomfortable.

287
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,700
Please sweetheat, do not feel
embarrassed if you feel the need...

288
00:15:27,735 --> 00:15:29,700
to pull the rip cord early,
say, Mistletoe...

289
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,800
if this house gets too
uncomfortable for you.

290
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,500
- Okay.
- Even if we're there for 10 min.

291
00:15:34,535 --> 00:15:36,500
All right, I'll let you
know where I'm at.

292
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,150
I'm just looking out for you
on this one. I want you to be cool.

293
00:15:39,185 --> 00:15:41,600
Brad, I'm gonna go see your
dad and your brothers right now.

294
00:15:41,635 --> 00:15:43,800
Unless you're too weird
with it, then we're out.

295
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,700
- I'm going in.
- And going out would be...

296
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,600
- Mistletoe.
- Done. Let's get out of here.

297
00:15:50,635 --> 00:15:53,800
Brad, we're going in. Let's go.

298
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,100
Son of a bitch.
The TV stars actually came.

299
00:16:06,135 --> 00:16:08,417
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Dad.

300
00:16:08,452 --> 00:16:10,576
Merry Christmas, tiny.
Good to see you.

301
00:16:10,611 --> 00:16:12,700
- Thanks for having us.
- Good to see you.

302
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,750
- Come on in.
- Okay.

303
00:16:14,785 --> 00:16:16,700
Let's... Let's celebrate.

304
00:16:16,735 --> 00:16:18,500
Okay. Sounds good.

305
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,700
That's a lot of presents
you sent there, boy.

306
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:26,600
You're trying
to out do us?

307
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,600
The biggest one is
for you, Howard.

308
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,465
Yeah? What is it?

309
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,600
I'm not gonna tell you.

310
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,700
What, are you crazy?

311
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,700
- Bro.
- Hey, buddy.

312
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,500
Baby!

313
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,800
Kate, these are my brothers:
Denver and Dallas.

314
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,600
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

315
00:16:54,635 --> 00:16:56,600
You must be, Orlando's girl.

316
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,700
Orlando?

317
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,800
We're named after the cities
in which we were conceived.

318
00:17:00,835 --> 00:17:03,700
I'm, Denver that's, Dallas.
And this is, Orlando.

319
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,465
Orlando?

320
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,600
My given name is, Orlando.
But I changed it to, Brad.

321
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,700
I'm, Brad.

322
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,765
What?

323
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,600
Well, merry christmas one and all.

324
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,700
- Orderves for anyone.
- Come on.

325
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,500
Who are you trying
to impress, Suze?

326
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,700
We also got beer moses in the back.

327
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,600
Ladies first.

328
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,600
Thank you so much.

329
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,600
What is this?
Is this cheese?

330
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,600
Yeah, spray.

331
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,800
Spray cheese from the famous
family of aerosol cheeses.

332
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,700
Give me a hand.

333
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,665
Here we go.

334
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,600
Do you have something
to say about my wife's cheese?

335
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,765
Hump it! Hump it!

336
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,800
I haven't seen
that move in a while.

337
00:17:59,835 --> 00:18:03,600
Shut it, soldier boy!

338
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,500
The spray cheese!
The spray cheese!

339
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,800
Bring it home, soldier boy.

340
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,700
Oh my, god, honey. I am so sorry
that you had to see that.

341
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,765
Let me apologize for them.

342
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,800
If you wanna say "Mistletoe"
because it's too heavy for you, I get it.

343
00:18:32,835 --> 00:18:34,665
I get it. I totally get it. Don't
feel weird about that.

344
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,700
If you need to get out of here, you let me
know where your comfort zone is.

345
00:18:37,735 --> 00:18:38,700
Beacause that was weird.

346
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,800
I can not believe you didn't
tell me your real name.

347
00:18:41,835 --> 00:18:43,600
- What are you talking about?
- I just...

348
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,800
It's just crazy to me. We've
been together for 3 years now

349
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,700
and I don't even know your real name.
doesn't that strike you as a little bit odd?

350
00:18:49,735 --> 00:18:53,117
No, it's not a little bit odd. I
hated my name, so I changed it.

351
00:18:53,152 --> 00:18:56,500
You don't say hey: "My name used
to be asshole, but it's, Bob. "

352
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,600
- You just say: "My name is, Bob. "
- Maybe to a stranger on the street...

353
00:18:59,635 --> 00:19:00,800
but to somebody you're
sharing your life with,

354
00:19:00,835 --> 00:19:02,665
Yeah you tell them your real name.

355
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,700
Sweetheart, I really don't want
to get into this right now.

356
00:19:04,735 --> 00:19:06,700
By rhe way this is exactly why I was
afraid if we came here.

357
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,665
this is isn't us, it's them.
We're letting them in.

358
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,700
Okay but your real name isn't asshole.
It's like your middle name.

359
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,665
Don't wanna be
blindsided again.

360
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,565
That's very funny. Go ahead
and take a shot at me.

361
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
It's bad enough, I have to deal
with those, Neanderthals

362
00:19:19,635 --> 00:19:21,500
but now I gotta take it from you too?

363
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,800
No, you shouldn't. You shouldn't
let them walk over you either.

364
00:19:24,835 --> 00:19:27,217
Kate, they are trained, UFC fighters.

365
00:19:27,252 --> 00:19:29,600
They know pressure
points on people.

366
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,565
But you're twice their size.

367
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,665
They're semi-professional
cage fighters.

368
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,700
Like one person comes out,
one person doesn't.

369
00:19:35,735 --> 00:19:38,565
A cock fighting
but with dudes.

370
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,700
- I thought you said they were personal trainers.
- They're dude cock fighters.

371
00:19:41,735 --> 00:19:43,565
Like that thing you see on the pay-per-view.

372
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,600
Yes exactly. Except they don't
actually get paid for it.

373
00:19:46,635 --> 00:19:48,600
They mostly just brawl
in people's backyards...

374
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,665
and then they upload
the footage to, YouTube.

375
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,500
Honey, my childhood was just
like the, "Shawshank Redemption".

376
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,800
Except I didn't have some kind,
older, soft spoken black man...

377
00:19:57,835 --> 00:19:59,600
to share my struggle with.

378
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,765
But you're not
that child anymore, okay?

379
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,500
You're a grown, strong,
confident, successful man.

380
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,665
I really don't want to get into this.

381
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,600
Brad, let me just let you know
the truth. They're intimidated by you.

382
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,600
What you need to do
is go out there...

383
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,800
and set some
healthy boundaries...

384
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,500
and demand that they respect
you. You know what I'm saying?

385
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,665
Hey, big city, come to
open up some presents!

386
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,600
- Come on son, we gotta go!
- This is your opportunity.

387
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,600
You can do this, baby.

388
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,700
Right, right.

389
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,700
Okay, gentlemen.

390
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,700
Can we take it down
a notch, please?

391
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,700
I'm not a kid, you can't
talk to me like that anymore.

392
00:20:40,735 --> 00:20:42,565
We're adults.
Do you understand?

393
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,700
I'm a grown man
with hair on my chest, right?

394
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,700
There's gonna be certain boundaries
that are gonna exist between us.

395
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,800
They might be invisible. I know you
gentlemen won't be able to see them,

396
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,600
but you're certainly gonna be able
to respect the fact that they're there.

397
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,600
These boundaries
are not to be crossed.

398
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,700
And if they are crossed, there's
gonna be real consequences to that.

399
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,700
Thank you.

400
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,500
Welcome back, stud!

401
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,600
Don't!

402
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,700
Stop!

403
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,600
Stop it!

404
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,765
Come on, can I go in?

405
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,700
No, you boys could get hurt.

406
00:21:33,735 --> 00:21:34,665
Come in!

407
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,500
- Come on!
- Take us in!

408
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,700
- Go!
- Yes!

409
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,600
Get it!

410
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,700
Google me, bitch!

411
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:48,800
What?

412
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,800
Google me. You might wanna
look me up sometime, Barbara!

413
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,600
No! Dad!

414
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,700
Stop!

415
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,700
Let's open the presents...

416
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,600
so, Orlando can get
to his other, christmases alright.

417
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,800
Let's do it.

418
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,600
Baby.

419
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,600
It's me. It's me.
Are you okay?

420
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,700
Did you break anything?

421
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,600
I am so proud of you.

422
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,600
Orlando, you're closest
to the tree, you distribute.

423
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,800
Gosh, wasn't it so
hard to find gifts...

424
00:22:33,835 --> 00:22:35,600
under the 10 dollar cap this year?

425
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,565
The first gift is to, Connor.

426
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,100
- The 10 dollar what?
- 10 dollar spending cap.

427
00:22:40,135 --> 00:22:42,600
Uncle Brad and his special
friend Kate, maybe...

428
00:22:42,635 --> 00:22:43,600
Brad?

429
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,600
I'll be your nice uncle...

430
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,700
...after you see what I got you.
Go ahead open it up.

431
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,500
- Brad?
- Yeah.

432
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,700
What?

433
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,600
- X-Box. This is awesome.
- Whoa.

434
00:22:54,635 --> 00:22:55,665
Top shelf for you, pal.

435
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,700
It's got the triple core processor,
wireless controllers the whole deal.

436
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,765
It was a 10 dollar
spending cap.

437
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,700
How in the hell did you find
an X-Box for under 10 dollars?

438
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,600
Looks like someone's trying to
show off how much money he makes.

439
00:23:07,635 --> 00:23:09,700
Maybe someone's family
didn't tell him that,

440
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,765
there was a 10 dollar spending cap.

441
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,800
Or maybe if you came home
you'd know crap like that.

442
00:23:13,835 --> 00:23:15,765
Guys can we try
to stay positive here?

443
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,800
What's the problem? We're trying
to give some gifts to some children.

444
00:23:18,835 --> 00:23:22,717
It's, christmas. Let's keep
the momentum going here.

445
00:23:22,752 --> 00:23:26,600
The next gift is to, Cody
and this is from your dad.

446
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,700
I'm sure this is
a good gift too. Okay?

447
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,500
Dig in there, tear it up.

448
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,800
A flashlight?

449
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,500
That's it?

450
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,665
Why don't you love me,
Daddy?

451
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,765
Okay, okay. Honestly,
I think it's my fault.

452
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,765
I didn't know there was
a 10 dollar spending cap.

453
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,800
Well my gift from, Santa Claus
better be straight cool.

454
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,600
I have a feeling that your
gift from, Santas

455
00:23:52,635 --> 00:23:54,700
probably going to ring
around 10 dollars too.

456
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,700
Why? Is, Santa Claus
cheap like my daddy?

457
00:23:57,735 --> 00:24:00,600
No, Santa is dad.
Dad is...

458
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,800
Right.

459
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,800
I don't understand.

460
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,600
What's happening? What's happening?
What's the problem?

461
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,600
There's no, Santa Claus.

462
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,700
You're joking with me, right?
You're kidding me.

463
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,600
They know there's
no, Santa Claus, right?

464
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,665
They do now.

465
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,700
How could you lie to us, Daddy?

466
00:24:21,735 --> 00:24:22,800
There is a Santa Claus.

467
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:23,800
Cody, come on.

468
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,600
You and Santa Claus
don't love me.

469
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,700
That's not gonna
bring back Santa. That's not...

470
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:31,700
When he gets hurt inside
and can't get...

471
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,600
...his emotions into words,
he takes to streaking.

472
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,600
Don't worry, he always comes back.

473
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,600
Nobody loves me!

474
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,565
Okay, look.
I'm really, really sorry.

475
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,600
- I just assumed...
- All right. All right.

476
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,565
Let's keep it moving.

477
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,600
I'm starting to lose my balls over here.

478
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,800
All right?

479
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,600
What's this one here?
You're gonna love this, poppy.

480
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,600
That's a satellite dish, Howard.

481
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,565
Why would I want a satellite?

482
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,700
That's not a satellite,
it's a satellite dish.

483
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,800
Terrific. You got so many more
channels and viewing options.

484
00:25:06,835 --> 00:25:08,700
You don't think I get enough channels?

485
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,800
Well, your TV right now
is a radio, so...

486
00:25:11,835 --> 00:25:12,765
Wait.

487
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,600
How much is this gift
gonna cost me a month?

488
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,700
Apparently it's not going to cost you.
We're paying for the services.

489
00:25:19,735 --> 00:25:21,700
- So, nothing actually.
- Wait, wait.

490
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,600
Just because I drive
a combine for a living...

491
00:25:24,635 --> 00:25:26,700
doesn't mean I need me
a fancy pants lawyer son...

492
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:28,765
- paying the bills for me.
- Okay, you win.

493
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,565
If you want to pay, for
the stuff, you pay for it.

494
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,600
The installation guy comes on Tuesday,
he's gonna install it for you.

495
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,765
Cancel it. We install things
ourselves in this house.

496
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,700
Dad, I think you gonna want
a professional to handle this.

497
00:25:40,735 --> 00:25:43,500
If you think I'll allow
a sex predator...

498
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,800
...in a uniform to wander
around my house...

499
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,700
...and touch my underwear...

500
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,600
You got another thing coming, no.

501
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,800
I'll see you top side in five.

502
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,600
All three on the roof.

503
00:25:55,635 --> 00:25:56,700
- Let's go.
- Okay.

504
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,600
To her mother.
I gotta take a grumpy.

505
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,700
What don't you...?

506
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,600
You wanna go over
to your mom?

507
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,600
Yeah, okay, come here.
Careful. There you go.

508
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,500
Ain't it nice to have everybody
home for the holidays?

509
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,800
Yes, it is.

510
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,600
We're gonna make
bologna sandwiches I think.

511
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,800
Okay, here we go.

512
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,700
Okay.

513
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,800
Take her before
it explodes.

514
00:26:31,835 --> 00:26:32,700
Thank you.

515
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,600
Gotta go and do
some man's work.

516
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,565
You gotta use
a lock nut on that.

517
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,600
I know what I'm doing.
I don't need any lock nut.

518
00:26:52,635 --> 00:26:53,765
Sorry, I know that you major...

519
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,700
...in a satellite dish
installation at, Stanford.

520
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
Yeah.

521
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,700
Great, dude. Mock me
for being educated. That's awesome.

522
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,600
- Hey, Grandpa!
- Hey!

523
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,700
Come play, war with me!

524
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,700
Maybe later, grandpa is busy.

525
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,500
Grandma's boyfriend
plays with me whenever I want.

526
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,600
Your grandmother's boyfriend
is a first class ass sniffer.

527
00:27:18,635 --> 00:27:19,700
You can tell him I said so.

528
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,800
Connor, go get us
some beers, man.

529
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,800
Sounds like you and mom
really turned a corner there.

530
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,700
I don't want to speak ill
of your mother on, christmas.

531
00:27:30,735 --> 00:27:31,600
But...

532
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,800
she's nothing but a
common street whore.

533
00:27:33,835 --> 00:27:35,800
Okay, that's great.
Nicely said.

534
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,500
What?
What do you call a woman...

535
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,700
...who throws away a career,
abandons her kids...

536
00:27:40,735 --> 00:27:42,565
...and runs off
with another man?

537
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,600
- What are you talking about?
- What do you call her?

538
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,565
Dad, she was a cashier,
that's not really a career.

539
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,700
That would fall in the category of a job,
and she left you because you wouldn't talk to her.

540
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:53,800
Stopped spending time with her. You
completly shut her out of your life.

541
00:27:53,835 --> 00:27:57,600
I fed her, I put a roof over her head
and I never lied to her face.

542
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,650
I spoiled her, that's what I did.

543
00:27:59,685 --> 00:28:01,642
Let that be a lesson to you kids...

544
00:28:01,677 --> 00:28:03,600
about being honest with your wives.

545
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:07,600
You can't spell "families"
without lies, am I right?

546
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,600
- Amen, Dad.
- Yeah.

547
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,600
What is she like...
two or three months?

548
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,565
- Nine.
- Wow.

549
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,700
- Yeah.
- Nine months.

550
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,500
She's not walking or
taking care of herself by now?

551
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,600
Are you kidding me?
Most days I'm lucky to get...

552
00:28:26,635 --> 00:28:28,600
my boob out of her mouth
so I can shower.

553
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,700
- Yeah.
- Does that hurt?

554
00:28:30,735 --> 00:28:31,700
What, breast feeding?

555
00:28:31,735 --> 00:28:32,700
No.

556
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,700
Maybe at first, but
the nipples get tough.

557
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,600
I can hardly
feel mine anymore.

558
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,500
You wanna flick one?

559
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,665
- No.
- Please.

560
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,700
- No, no.
- Go ahead.

561
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,600
That's okay. I have a set of my
own. So I'm just gonna pass.

562
00:28:48,635 --> 00:28:49,800
- Sure. Of course.
- But thanks.

563
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,500
Okay, we're all set!

564
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,500
Hey!

565
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,600
The picture's all fuzzy.

566
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,800
Did you get me some
sort of cheap old satellite?

567
00:28:59,835 --> 00:29:02,667
No, it's not a cheap
old satellite.

568
00:29:02,702 --> 00:29:05,500
I just gotta adjust it.
How about now?

569
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,665
Even worse!

570
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,800
I can make it work! Hold on!

571
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,500
How about now?

572
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,665
Dad...!

573
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,700
Could you hold her?
I need to bake another thing.

574
00:29:13,735 --> 00:29:15,600
No, actually... Okay.

575
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,665
Okay.

576
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,500
Come on, you can't break her.

577
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,665
- Okay.
- Yeah.

578
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,800
Okay, you know what...?

579
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,700
It's a satellite, you gotta
point it up at the satellite.

580
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,650
How about now, is it better now?

581
00:29:26,685 --> 00:29:28,500
No, it's worse.
It's still crappy.

582
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,800
I don't think she likes me.

583
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,700
She likes you fine.

584
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,600
Just give her a chance
to warm up to you.

585
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,600
- How about now?
- Worse. It's worse.

586
00:29:38,635 --> 00:29:39,600
Son of a bitch.

587
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,800
Take the damn thing down. I
can do better with my rabbit ears.

588
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,600
I love my rabbit ears!

589
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,800
Can you tell me "hot or cold".

590
00:29:50,835 --> 00:29:52,565
- What?
- Hot or cold.

591
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,500
Hot or cold what? What the hell
does that mean, hot or cold?

592
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,600
How long until
she warms up to me?

593
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,600
Not long at all.

594
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,150
- Horrible.
- Point it up!

595
00:30:05,185 --> 00:30:06,565
Shut up, and let me work!

596
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,700
I don't want a fancy satellite.
I don't want any kind of satellite.

597
00:30:09,735 --> 00:30:13,500
It's not a satellite, genius!
It's a satellite dish!

598
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,500
Okay.

599
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,800
- Pull the thing and...
- Get off my roof!

600
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,500
Pull the damn thing!

601
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,565
It's too much.

602
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,700
Whatever you're doing,
stop it right now!

603
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,700
- Leave my TV alone!
- I'm fine!

604
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,700
She stopped crying.

605
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,700
I did it!

606
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,700
You idiot! Stop it!

607
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,700
- This is all right.
- Leave my TV alone!

608
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,500
I'm fine.

609
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,765
That's awesome.

610
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,700
Okay, I'm coming up.

611
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,000
Give me back my baby!

612
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,700
Mistletoe.

613
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,500
Mistletoe.

614
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,800
I can't believe I nailed
that baby's head.

615
00:31:39,835 --> 00:31:41,465
I feel kind of bad about that.

616
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,700
That's my brother's kid. You couldn't
have possibly blown it's, IQ. It's fine.

617
00:31:44,735 --> 00:31:46,800
I did get it to stop
crying there for a second.

618
00:31:46,835 --> 00:31:48,800
I think it kind of liked me.

619
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,565
Yeah.

620
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,700
Oh my, god! Do you know what happens
to your nipples after your breast feed?

621
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,765
I don't think I wanna know either.

622
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,500
No, I don't think you do.
It's violent.

623
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,600
- They crack up like tire rubber.
- Okay.

624
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,700
Just so you know, it's a bit of
a cougar den here at my Mom's.

625
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,800
This is different.

626
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,500
Maybe she has
a new boyfriend.

627
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,765
Merry christmas, mom.

628
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,600
Merry christmas, Kate.
Come on in.

629
00:32:29,635 --> 00:32:30,600
Merry christmas.

630
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,600
Give me a hug, Kate.

631
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,700
Oh, okay.

632
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,500
Good to see you.

633
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,700
And you must be, Brad.

634
00:32:40,735 --> 00:32:41,600
Mrs. Kincaid.

635
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,500
Call me, Marilyn
and get over here...

636
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,700
and give me a hug, you big,
fat, purple teddy bear.

637
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,600
Bring it!

638
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,600
- Yes, yes!
- Hey, merry christmas.

639
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,600
Shit, that feels good.

640
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,600
You're so tall and firm
like a giant oak.

641
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,700
He's tall.

642
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,800
- Brad, this is my aunt, Sarah.
- Hi.

643
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,665
- This is my aunt, Donna.
- Hi.

644
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,600
- Is that genuine leather.
- Nice to meet you, ladies.

645
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,765
The one in the canarian hanging
on your belt is, gram, gram.

646
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,700
I'm sorry, gram, gram, but that's
my belt. That's attached to me.

647
00:33:14,735 --> 00:33:17,600
Sorry, merry christmas to you.
It's a great sweater.

648
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,800
I get it.

649
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,500
This is the den. Well,
everyone's in here.

650
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,665
I can't believe you came.

651
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,665
- Hi, Courtney.
- Hi, sweetie.

652
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,600
Hey listen, I can't get up,
Jackson is very gassy...

653
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:33,800
and I gotta keep
bouncing him.

654
00:33:33,835 --> 00:33:34,765
Okay.

655
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,700
- Well, this is, Brad.
- Hi.

656
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,700
Hi.

657
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,500
I'm, Courtney.

658
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,500
- Brad. merry christmas.
- merry christmas.

659
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,600
And that's granddad

660
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,600
and this is, Courtney's husband, Jim.

661
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,500
- Take, Jackson.
- All right.

662
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,565
He's so good with kids.
Yeah.

663
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,665
- We're gonna try again.
- Well...

664
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,700
Oh I forgot you're too cool for kids.
It cramps your independence.

665
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,565
I never said, I was too cool for kids.

666
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,765
I know you didn't say it.
But you don't have any.

667
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:07,600
And you have really strong
concrete ideas about not having any.

668
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,600
Well, that's actually not...

669
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,500
You know, I'd rather just not get into it.

670
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,700
Where's, Kasi?

671
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,800
She's outside in the jump-jump
with the rest of the neighbourhood kids.

672
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,700
There's a jump-jump?

673
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,765
Kate always hated the jump-jump.

674
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,600
In the 5th grade, bunch of kids trapped
Kate inside the jump-jump.

675
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,500
- She never got over it.
- I got over it.

676
00:34:29,535 --> 00:34:31,600
They tortured her
for about an hour.

677
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,600
Why would they trap
you in there that long?

678
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,600
Because she was...

679
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,700
"Cootie Kate".

680
00:34:37,735 --> 00:34:38,700
Courtney.

681
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,600
Who's cootie, Kate?

682
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,800
- She didn't tell you about cootie, Kate?
- Mom, I really don't think this is necessary.

683
00:34:43,835 --> 00:34:46,700
All the kids pretended
that, Kate had cooties...

684
00:34:46,735 --> 00:34:48,500
...and no one talked to her.

685
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,100
If Kate even touched you,
you'd have to wipe it off...

686
00:34:51,135 --> 00:34:53,600
and spray with disinfectant
to get off the cooties.

687
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,700
That sounds like it could be really hurtful.
How long did that go along for?

688
00:34:56,735 --> 00:34:58,700
Not long. I don't
remember, but it wasn't long.

689
00:34:58,735 --> 00:35:00,217
Seven years. Until 6th.

690
00:35:00,252 --> 00:35:01,665
That was a long time ago.

691
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,800
I'm sure you don't
have cooties now.

692
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:04,800
Let's test it out.

693
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,500
Ahh... cooties!

694
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,250
Pastor Phil has encouraged us to dispense...

695
00:35:14,285 --> 00:35:17,700
with the commercial
trappings of the holidays.

696
00:35:17,735 --> 00:35:19,600
- Who's, Pastor Phil?
- Mom's new beau.

697
00:35:19,635 --> 00:35:20,700
It's a whole new thing.

698
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,700
So...

699
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,500
what I had in mind
was that...

700
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,565
we would go around
the room and each of us...

701
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,800
would speak to the spiritual
gifts that we might give.

702
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,700
A verbal gift giving of sorts.

703
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,800
Wait. There's
really no presents.

704
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:38,700
Kasi.

705
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,500
None that you can see.

706
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,800
Okay, I'll go first.

707
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,700
I would like to give more
of myself to my church...

708
00:35:46,735 --> 00:35:48,600
and to, Pastor Phil.

709
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,700
gram-gram,
would you like to go next?

710
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,700
I could increase the frequency
with which...

711
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,700
...I pleasure, Milton with
my hand and with my mouth.

712
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,600
Did she just say that?

713
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,700
Brad, why don't you go next?

714
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,500
I follow, gram, gram with that...

715
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,700
...hand stuff and what she
does with her... Yeah, okay?

716
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,600
I'd like to umm...

717
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,500
with Kate...

718
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,700
would be too...

719
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,700
Vacationing more frequently
and doing it with, Kate.

720
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,700
That is lovely, Brad.

721
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,700
- He's so well spoken.
- Thank you. Thank you.

722
00:36:38,735 --> 00:36:40,565
Courtney, what would you give?

723
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,600
Well, I'd like
to give myself a gift.

724
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,700
And that is the gift
of being pregnant.

725
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,600
I know that comes with its
own challenges for 9 months...

726
00:36:49,635 --> 00:36:52,600
like getting fat and having
people stare at you funny

727
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,700
when you sneak a cig, but.

728
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,665
I'd also like to give
myself another gift.

729
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,800
And that is a scheduled,
C- section that goes routinely

730
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,600
Don't most women want
to have a natural birth?

731
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,800
Yeah, those women
who haven't done it before.

732
00:37:06,835 --> 00:37:07,800
Right.

733
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,700
You just come here.

734
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,600
Auntie, Kate will you
please hold him whilst I..?

735
00:37:15,635 --> 00:37:16,665
What do I do?

736
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,250
You gotta hold him.
Okay, got him?

737
00:37:19,285 --> 00:37:21,800
I'll fix myself here.
There we go.

738
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,700
- What should I do with him?
- See if he made a stinky.

739
00:37:24,735 --> 00:37:25,700
How do I do that?

740
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,600
Just lift up his diaper
and see if he made one.

741
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,600
Oh... Oh yeah there's something in here.

742
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,600
It's a really disgusting...

743
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,600
Jackson...

744
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,600
Your projectile on auntie, Kate.

745
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,800
- I'm gonna vomit.
- Brad, are you okay?

746
00:37:45,835 --> 00:37:47,600
Get him some water.

747
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,700
- I'm about to throw up.
- Oh, God.

748
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,800
I'll get sick. I can't be here.

749
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,700
What do I do?

750
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,750
Take it away from me.
I'm sorry. I love you.

751
00:37:56,785 --> 00:37:58,700
You gotta get out of here. I can't breathe.

752
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,700
I want to do it too!

753
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,800
- Kate!
- What?

754
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,800
Are you joking me? These are the only
clothes we have in the entire house?

755
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,700
How's that even possible?

756
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,600
It's not like you ever come around.
You haven't been here in like... Forever.

757
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,150
I can not believe you told him
about "Cootie Kate".

758
00:38:20,185 --> 00:38:22,442
How was I supposed to
know you hadn't told him?

759
00:38:22,477 --> 00:38:24,665
Like you would tell, Jim you're
"Cootie, Courtney".

760
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,800
Jim and I know everything there
is to know about each other.

761
00:38:26,835 --> 00:38:29,600
He knows I slept with
the entire water polo team.

762
00:38:29,635 --> 00:38:31,600
Just like I know he
experimented with men.

763
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,700
- I didn't need to know that.
- Listen, Kate my point is, after three years...

764
00:38:35,735 --> 00:38:37,565
I would think that
you and, Brad...

765
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,700
would know a little bit more about
each other than you already do.

766
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,800
How can you really appreciate
someone for who they are...

767
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,800
until you really know them?

768
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,600
Thank you.

769
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,700
I kind of feel like a
Saudi prince in here.

770
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,700
We're just so glad that
Kate has a boyfriend.

771
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,600
You're the longest relationship
she's ever had with a man.

772
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,700
With a man?

773
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,700
What' is this?

774
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,700
Oh, my God.

775
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,500
Who's that?

776
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,700
That's, Josephine.

777
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,700
Everyone called her, Joe.
She was, Kate's only friend.

778
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,600
Last I heard, Joe coaches
women's wrestling.

779
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,600
Check that out!

780
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,600
- That's, Kate?
- Yeah.

781
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,700
She looks like, Shaq.

782
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,600
Hi, auntie Kate.

783
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,600
- Hi, Kasi.
- What are you doing?

784
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,600
Not much. Do you need
to use the bathroom?

785
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,500
What's this?

786
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,700
That is my
special magic marker.

787
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,765
What?

788
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,765
We not allowed to have
magic markers in the house.

789
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,700
- I have to tell my mom.
- No. You don't need to tell your mom.

790
00:41:18,735 --> 00:41:20,700
Actually, can I have it back because...

791
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,565
Kasi.

792
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,600
You want this?

793
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,600
This is not a joke,
this is not game.

794
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,600
Auntie Kate needs
her marker back, okay?

795
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,800
Kasi, this is not funny!

796
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,600
Kasi,
please come out of there!

797
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,600
Don't make me
come and get you.

798
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,500
Kasi!

799
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,700
Come on!

800
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,500
Come and get it!

801
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,765
Wait a minute.
Kate went to a fat camp?

802
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,600
Yeah, she lost three pounds.
It only took her all summer.

803
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,700
A pound a month.

804
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,600
Courtney.

805
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,500
Kasi, honey. Please
give me back that marker!

806
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,800
Keep away!

807
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,600
Come and get it, old lady!

808
00:42:54,635 --> 00:42:55,565
What?

809
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,700
Keep away! Keep away!

810
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,800
Give it to me!

811
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,565
"Give it to me. "

812
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,600
Just give me the marker.
Okay?

813
00:43:01,635 --> 00:43:03,600
"Just give me the marker.
Okay?"

814
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,600
Come and get it!
Sucker!

815
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:11,700
Get it!

816
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,600
Yeah!

817
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,800
- That's Kate?
- Yes.

818
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,600
Wait a minute. Hold on.
You told me... Who's that?

819
00:43:22,635 --> 00:43:24,700
- That's Kate.
- That's not a boy named, Bjorn?

820
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,600
Can't believe it, Kate is
actually playing with, Kasi.

821
00:43:38,635 --> 00:43:40,700
I've never seen her
play with my kids before.

822
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,700
Hey! Okay!

823
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,600
Mistletoe!

824
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,600
Brad! Mistletoe!

825
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,500
Mistletoe!

826
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,600
- We're so glad you're here, Brad.
- I'm having so much fun.

827
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:02,700
What did she take so long to
bring you here? Is what I wanna know.

828
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,600
I came here for a marker...

829
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,600
and I'm not leaving
without one!

830
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,700
Kasi!

831
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,600
That marker in your mouth,
I peed on it!

832
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,500
Hey,hey!

833
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,800
Sweetheart you never told me
you went to a fat camp.

834
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,565
Okay it was called, "Get fit camp".

835
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,500
I can't believe my family is showing
you all the pictures of my childhood.

836
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,650
You know what my favorite ones
are though, of when you're a baby...

837
00:45:44,685 --> 00:45:46,700
'cause it looks almost like you
were almost meant to be a twin...

838
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,700
- but you ate the other baby in the womb.
- Brad.

839
00:45:48,735 --> 00:45:50,665
- That's why you're so powerful.
- Stop.

840
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,700
Because you ate your twin sister,
and you took all of her powers.

841
00:45:53,735 --> 00:45:55,500
- Cut it out.
- Baby, I love you.

842
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:59,700
It doesn't bother me if you
were a really abnormally large child...

843
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,600
with lesbian tendencies, 'cause
if that was your journey...

844
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:04,600
- then I'm cool with it.
- What are you saying, lesbian tendencies?

845
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,700
- I saw the pictures of, Joe.
- Joe wasn't gay.

846
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:11,700
Haircuts don't lie.
What did you do with Joe...

847
00:46:11,735 --> 00:46:14,217
like play baseball
and ride motorcycles?

848
00:46:14,252 --> 00:46:16,665
We're just kids.
She was really imaginative.

849
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,650
We played in the basement.
She had this game: "Sun tan".

850
00:46:19,685 --> 00:46:22,242
We pretended we're on the
beach, she'd take lotion...

851
00:46:22,277 --> 00:46:24,800
she never wanted me
to burn, so she would rub it...

852
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,600
Okay, listen and look
at me. You're better kisser for it.

853
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,700
All I'm saying to you is, it's not fun when
the shoes on the other foot, right.

854
00:46:33,735 --> 00:46:35,800
You shouldn't have been so shitty
with me with the whole, Orlando stuff.

855
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:38,700
when you have so many
skeletons in your own closet, right.

856
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,600
Do not throw rocks when
you live in the house of, Joe.

857
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,800
Okay, I see your point.

858
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:46,600
I love you.
I'll see you in a little bit.

859
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:52,700
Mom.

860
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,765
I really need to talk
to you for a sec.

861
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,500
Kate, I don't have time for this. I don't
wanna be late for, Pastor Phil.

862
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,500
But I just...

863
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,565
But I just... I kinda want
to talk about this now.

864
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,600
Well if it's important now, it'll be
important after church, right?

865
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,765
Well yeah but...

866
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,700
Clean yourself up a little,
this is a nice church.

867
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,700
And now...

868
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:29,700
...the, Pastor Phil!

869
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:33,800
Hello. There's a new born King.
Hallelujah!

870
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,600
Hallelujah!

871
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,700
Praise Him!
Hallelujah!

872
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:42,700
Praise Him! Praise Him!
Talk to Him, lady!

873
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,500
Glory to the new born King!

874
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,500
Hallelujah!

875
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:53,700
Please be seated.

876
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,600
I've been given a note.

877
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,665
The, Walshes who
performed the role...

878
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:04,565
of, Mary and Joseph
for the last three years...

879
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,000
and done a great job of it, they had
some food that didn't agree with them.

880
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,550
So, we're gonna need
a pair of volunteers...

881
00:48:09,585 --> 00:48:11,600
to perform the roles
of, Mary and Joseph.

882
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:16,600
You should do it.

883
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:17,600
What?

884
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:20,665
No, I won't get in front
of a bunch of strangers.

885
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:23,700
You're staged trained. You
played Pippin in High School.

886
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,800
No. I wasn't Pippin,
I was in Pippin.

887
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,650
I played a tree because I had a bad
stage fright, do you remember this?

888
00:48:30,685 --> 00:48:33,700
I know this seems like I'm putting you
on the spot and in fact I am.

889
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,700
Honey, Pastor Phil needs you.

890
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,700
- I'm not gonna do it.
- Do I have a volunteer?

891
00:48:39,735 --> 00:48:41,600
Or do I still need
a volunteer?

892
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,800
Kate will play
the, Virgin Mary.

893
00:48:44,835 --> 00:48:45,765
What?

894
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,800
Hallelujah! The cure of the world!

895
00:48:47,835 --> 00:48:49,600
I just said I wouldn't.

896
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,600
Hallelujah! Kate, you stand up!

897
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:53,800
Stand up, please!

898
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,700
Look at the joy you've brought
to this congregation, Kate...

899
00:48:57,735 --> 00:48:59,717
by your volunteering
to be, Mary.

900
00:48:59,752 --> 00:49:01,700
Hello. I still need a, Joseph.

901
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:04,700
Brad be, Joseph.

902
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,565
I'm not staged trained.
I never played Pippin.

903
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,700
You don't have to give the performance.
You just have to get up there.

904
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,600
- because I don't wanna be alone.
- It's not gonna happen.

905
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:13,800
Oh rub a pon-pon, Brad, you stand up!

906
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,600
You are a part of this, Brad!

907
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:38,600
Listen to me, Brad. I'm going to really
need you to look out for me up there.

908
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:41,600
Because I'm starting
to get like really nervous.

909
00:49:41,635 --> 00:49:43,700
- That stage fright thing.
- How do I look?

910
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,700
- What do you think?
- You look fine. I'm trying to get...

911
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:50,500
My man's skirt, is it
short or is it okay?

912
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:51,700
- Honestly.
- It's a little short.

913
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,700
Okay here's, Jesus.

914
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,600
They don't use a doll?

915
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,500
- Here are your scripts.
- Scripts?

916
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,700
- I'm not ready for scripts...
- Hi, Jesus.

917
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,700
No one ever told me
there's gonna be lines...

918
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,600
- Hi, Jesus.
- Actually, his name's, Bernard.

919
00:50:06,635 --> 00:50:08,565
Okay.
Hi, Bernard.

920
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,650
Okay, I got lines. I gotta
try to get my voice ready.

921
00:50:11,685 --> 00:50:14,700
Red leather. Yellow leather.
Red leather. Yellow webber.

922
00:50:14,735 --> 00:50:16,500
This is a good baby.

923
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:18,500
Look at this baby.

924
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:21,600
Baby, baby Jesus
is really kind of cute.

925
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,600
This child is a blessing
to the both of us.

926
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:25,800
Really?

927
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,700
What, do you think
I should do it bigger?

928
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,500
Should I do it maybe like, "This child's
a blessing for the both of us.

929
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,765
But not angry. Inspired.

930
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,700
Oh, my God. There's so many
different ways to play this thing.

931
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,765
Can I ask you
a question seriously?

932
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,565
My wife is pregnant,
but it's not my child.

933
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,600
But do you think I'm cool with it because
god's the one that got her pregnant?

934
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,500
Are we ready
to see the result...

935
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,500
of that immaculate conception?

936
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,500
Hallelujah!

937
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,600
Brad, I don't feel good.

938
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,750
Maybe you should
hold the baby.

939
00:50:58,785 --> 00:51:00,665
Sweetheart, I gotta get ready.

940
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:03,500
Just remember,
acting is reacting.

941
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:06,500
And Joseph and Mary,
went up from, Galilee...

942
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:07,800
and out of the city
of, Nazareth.

943
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:12,500
Okay, find your truth.
I'll blow the roof of this bitch.

944
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,600
Brad.

945
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,565
I can't do this.

946
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,700
Check it out, baby.
They're digging my walk.

947
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:35,700
Because there was no room in
the inn, they stayed in the stable.

948
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,500
And Mary wrapped the baby
in swaddling clothes...

949
00:51:41,535 --> 00:51:42,700
and placed him
in a manger.

950
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:56,800
And Mary wrapped the baby
in swaddling clothes...

951
00:51:56,835 --> 00:51:59,600
and placed him in a manger.

952
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,600
Put it, in it.

953
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,665
Brad, help me swaddle.

954
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,800
I've gotta save my line,
we're losing the audience.

955
00:52:10,835 --> 00:52:12,600
It's deadlier out there.

956
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:13,700
Come on, Mary!

957
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,500
This child is a blessing
to the both of us.

958
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:21,600
Amen!

959
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:23,700
That's right!

960
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:28,800
Your line.

961
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:32,565
I forgot my line.

962
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,500
- What?
- I forgot my line.

963
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,800
Thank goodness
I memorize yours too.

964
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,700
We shall name him, Jesus.

965
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,600
Glory to, god!

966
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,800
And peace on earth
to the highest point on earth!

967
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,700
This thing isn't big
enough to swaddle him.

968
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,765
Someone's got to give
a performance.

969
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,700
I'm nervous. I can't feel my
legs. Please don't do this to me.

970
00:52:59,735 --> 00:53:01,700
It'd appear that my wife is better at...

971
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,700
making babies than
swaddling them, no? Yes?

972
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:12,500
Brad, you're wearing the
swaddle cloth on your belt.

973
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:16,665
Woman, do your job
and swaddle this baby!

974
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:20,500
Brad, I can't. You're wearing
the swaddle around your belt!

975
00:53:20,535 --> 00:53:23,600
Enough! This child's
life is now in jeopardy.

976
00:53:23,635 --> 00:53:26,600
Unfit mother, give me this baby.

977
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:34,600
And I, Joseph,
shall swaddle this baby!

978
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:39,800
And I, Joseph,
will protect this child.

979
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,600
Forgive her, son...

980
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:47,500
for she knows not
what she's done!

981
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:54,700
Yeah!

982
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:03,765
Hallelujah!

983
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,800
That's the message
of, christmas.

984
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:08,700
Hallelujah!

985
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:13,700
Hallelujah!

986
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,500
Brad, that was...!

987
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:23,700
# All is calm #

988
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:27,600
# All is bright #

989
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:34,700
# Round young
Virgin Mother and Child #

990
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:41,600
# Holy infant
so tender and mild #

991
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,665
I know how, Celine Dion
feels after one of those shows,

992
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,765
because she gives so much, it's not like
you're getting a lot back.

993
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:49,800
- 'cause I got a lot back to.
- Celine Dion. You feel like, Celine Dion?

994
00:54:49,835 --> 00:54:51,800
How do you calm down
of a such a high?

995
00:54:51,835 --> 00:54:53,600
It's difficult to do that.

996
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,650
I can't believe you threw me down...

997
00:54:55,685 --> 00:54:57,600
in front of the entire congregation.

998
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:59,000
You were just thinking
about yourself up there.

999
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,565
I was thinking about
the entire show.

1000
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,700
And quite frankly
with you, Kate, I think I...

1001
00:55:02,735 --> 00:55:04,600
I brought the whole thing home.

1002
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:05,600
- My God.
- I did.

1003
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,700
- Is this how it's gonna be with us?
- Is this how it's gonna... What's..?

1004
00:55:07,735 --> 00:55:09,800
- What are you saying?
- I'd like to know...

1005
00:55:09,835 --> 00:55:11,665
you'll be there for me in a crisis.

1006
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,800
If we're on a plane,
and it was going down.

1007
00:55:13,835 --> 00:55:15,565
and I was passed out and I say,

1008
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,700
"Everyone needs to put
on your oxygen mask. "

1009
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,700
I would like to know that were gonna
put mine on before you put your own. You know?

1010
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:23,600
I wouldn't and the, FAA wouldn't
want me to do it either.

1011
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,665
- I'm not... FAA?
- If you'd listen...

1012
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:27,800
- What?
- Do you ever listen to the stewardesses?

1013
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,800
Or are you too busy moving your, BlackBerry
and having them tell you to shut it off?

1014
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,665
- I listen to the stewardesses.
- When they say...

1015
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:36,700
...that you're supposed to put
your mask on in case of an emergency...

1016
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,800
before you try to help out a child
or an unfit adult next to you.

1017
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,765
- I've heard her.
- Because If you pass out...

1018
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,700
you're not helping anybody.
"Put the mask on this one. "

1019
00:55:43,735 --> 00:55:46,600
Now I'm passed out. Now I'm
not living I won't help anybody.

1020
00:55:46,635 --> 00:55:47,600
It's not the point I'm trying to make.

1021
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,800
What is the point? Sweetheart I'm
sorry, maybe I got this wrong.

1022
00:55:49,835 --> 00:55:51,500
What's your point?

1023
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,800
I feel like we're not really connecting.
It's like you're not even present.

1024
00:55:55,835 --> 00:55:58,600
I have been present.
I've been here all day.

1025
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:00,700
We've been doing things
alongside each other

1026
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,500
but I'd like for us to do
somethings together.

1027
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:06,600
Kate, I that you're upset
with your family...

1028
00:56:06,635 --> 00:56:08,500
and I think you're
taking it out on me.

1029
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,565
They've been
my family for years.

1030
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,600
This is not about my family,
this is about you and me.

1031
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:14,700
I just...

1032
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,000
I just want something different for us.

1033
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,700
- Merry christmas.
- Mom!

1034
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,800
- God I've missed you!
- Good to see you, Mom!

1035
00:56:22,835 --> 00:56:23,800
It's been so long.

1036
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,800
- And you must be, Kate.
- Yes.

1037
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:29,500
She's a darling.

1038
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,600
- Thank you. Nice to meet you.
- Oh It's so wonderful to meet you.

1039
00:56:32,635 --> 00:56:34,600
- Should I call you...
- Just call me, Paula.

1040
00:56:34,635 --> 00:56:35,700
- Just, Paula.
- Okay.

1041
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,800
I am so glad you came.

1042
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,650
You've been
taking good care of him.

1043
00:56:40,685 --> 00:56:42,642
Certainly hasn't missed many meals.

1044
00:56:42,677 --> 00:56:44,638
- That's great.
- He likes a snack.

1045
00:56:44,673 --> 00:56:46,600
- I do like the snack.
- Yes, he does.

1046
00:56:46,635 --> 00:56:47,600
Come on in and relax.

1047
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:50,600
I've fixed all of your
favorite dishes, Bradford.

1048
00:56:50,635 --> 00:56:52,565
Denver and Susan
are watching TV.

1049
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,700
Let's sit here and
catch up for a minute.

1050
00:56:54,735 --> 00:56:56,800
- Your house is beautiful.
- Oh thank you.

1051
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:58,565
This is gorgeous.

1052
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,100
Well you knew, Bradford lived
with me after the divorce.

1053
00:57:01,135 --> 00:57:03,600
Denver and Dallas were more
comfortable with, Howard.

1054
00:57:03,635 --> 00:57:05,800
But, Bradford was
the more sensitive type.

1055
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,600
- Okay you know I was thinking...
- Oh we were just best friends.

1056
00:57:08,635 --> 00:57:09,600
Just inseparable.

1057
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,665
My god, he breastfed
until he was five.

1058
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:14,700
Thought I was going to have
to take you to college.

1059
00:57:14,735 --> 00:57:15,665
Okay, I think
we've had enough...

1060
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:17,665
The only one who
was on my tits more...

1061
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:19,700
was a professor that
I dated after his father.

1062
00:57:19,735 --> 00:57:22,167
Could you not say "tits", please?

1063
00:57:22,202 --> 00:57:24,600
- Hey, kids.
- Okay this is, Darryl.

1064
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,565
Hi, nice to meet you.

1065
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,700
It is so nice to meet you,
young lady.

1066
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,565
And always great
to see you, big guy.

1067
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,700
Hey, how was traffic
getting out here, huh?

1068
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:38,500
You know what, can I get your gas
money? I'd like to get your gas money.

1069
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,700
Actually, I don't need you
to get my gas money.

1070
00:57:40,735 --> 00:57:42,800
Thank you. I actually make
a lot more than you do.

1071
00:57:42,835 --> 00:57:45,800
- So, no thank you.
- Bradford, be nice.

1072
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:47,800
It's okay, sweetie.

1073
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,800
Look...

1074
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:53,700
Brad...

1075
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,700
I'm not trying
to be your father.

1076
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:57,800
You already got one of those.

1077
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,700
I'm just hoping for a
chance to be your friend.

1078
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:05,600
You were my friend, Darryl.
You were my best friend.

1079
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,800
We grew up together,
we rode bikes together.

1080
00:58:07,835 --> 00:58:09,765
we used to smell
each other's hands.

1081
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,500
But now you're sleeping with my
mom and it's a little bit weird for me

1082
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:13,700
can you appreciate that?

1083
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,750
I never had a sexual thought
about your mom until I was 30.

1084
00:58:16,785 --> 00:58:19,700
Can you leave it alone. You can't
be my friend anymore.

1085
00:58:19,735 --> 00:58:21,665
You can't be sleeping
with my mom...

1086
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:24,600
- and still be my friend, okay?
- I'm thirsty, is anybody else thirsty?

1087
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:25,750
Kate, what can
I get you to drink?

1088
00:58:25,785 --> 00:58:26,765
- I'm good.
- Look, your mother...

1089
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,700
- is a very sexual being, Bradford.
- She's a very what?

1090
00:58:29,735 --> 00:58:30,765
She's a great lover.

1091
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,665
Say that again and I'm gonna
bust your mouth open.

1092
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,800
Hey, look it. This is, christmas
and we're not gonna go there.

1093
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,665
Kate has been kind enough
to send us some games.

1094
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:42,800
We are gonna play them
and we're gonna have fun. Okay?

1095
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,800
Why are you staring at me
when you eat the wings?

1096
00:58:53,835 --> 00:58:55,700
That's... uncomfortable.

1097
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:00,650
Oh, Conner honey
don't eat those brownies.

1098
00:59:00,685 --> 00:59:02,600
Those are grandmothers
special brownies.

1099
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,150
Kate, could you be a lamb
and explain the rules?

1100
00:59:06,185 --> 00:59:08,700
Of course. So, you try to
get your team mate...

1101
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,565
to say the word
on the top of the card...

1102
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:12,700
but you can't say any
of the words listed beneath.

1103
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,800
And if you say any
of the taboo words...

1104
00:59:14,835 --> 00:59:16,700
- then you get buzzed.
- Okay.

1105
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,465
That makes sense?

1106
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,800
I'm so excited to have you
all here to play this game together.

1107
00:59:20,835 --> 00:59:22,565
It's gonna be so much fun.

1108
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,600
Hey, it's good to have
my friend back.

1109
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:28,500
So, who wants to go first?

1110
00:59:28,535 --> 00:59:29,465
- I'll go.
- Okay.

1111
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,500
Brad, why don't you
buzz your mom...

1112
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,700
- and then I'll do the timer.
- Okay.

1113
00:59:33,735 --> 00:59:34,700
Thanks.

1114
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,600
On your mark, get set, go!

1115
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,600
Okay, this is a town in, France.

1116
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:43,765
What?

1117
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:46,500
- You can't say, "France" it's on the.
- You don't have to buzz me like that, Brad.

1118
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:47,765
It's the same, loud for everybody.

1119
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,600
It's okay sweetie, just
do the next card.

1120
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:52,600
Okay.

1121
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,600
This is me, I'm a...

1122
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:55,765
Cradle robber.

1123
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,700
- What did he say?
- Keep going.

1124
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,700
Don't worry about it.
You're a therapist, keep going.

1125
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,800
- No, no, not Capricorn but...
- a, Libra.

1126
01:00:02,835 --> 01:00:03,800
Yes!

1127
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:06,600
It's fun.

1128
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:08,600
Okay.

1129
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:10,700
This is what you dripped on me?

1130
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:12,700
Ohh, wax!

1131
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:13,800
No, after that.

1132
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:16,500
It's brown.

1133
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:17,800
Okay make this stop, please.

1134
01:00:17,835 --> 01:00:18,765
Ohh, oh, chocolate.

1135
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:20,700
- No, before that! After the wax!
- Oh my god.

1136
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:23,600
- The syrup!
- Yes!

1137
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,800
Way sticky dude, I
would not recommend that.

1138
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:28,600
- Okay.
- Okay, time.

1139
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:29,800
Time.

1140
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,600
- Good job. Good job.
- We only got two.

1141
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:33,700
Who wants to go next?

1142
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,600
- We'll go.
- Okay, great.

1143
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:37,700
I'll do the buzzer.

1144
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:41,700
Are you gonna actually
eat while you play that?

1145
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:43,800
- Just flip the tube.
- Excuse me?

1146
01:00:43,835 --> 01:00:44,800
Flip the tube.

1147
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:47,700
Okay. On your mark,
get set, go!

1148
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:50,600
- Capital of, China.
- Hong Kong.

1149
01:00:50,635 --> 01:00:51,600
Yes.

1150
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:53,700
Thing next to your bed
on the night stand.

1151
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:54,700
- A sock.
- Yes.

1152
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:58,700
I helped you come up
with this, when you were drunk...

1153
01:00:58,735 --> 01:01:00,800
and came home from
the bar last, thursday.

1154
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:02,600
- Alibi.
- Yes.

1155
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,800
Alright, the thing I'm not
allowed to wear to, supercross.

1156
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:07,500
- Mini skirt.
- Yes!

1157
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,500
Me and you dry humping
on the beach.

1158
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,700
- A screensaver.
- Yes, baby!

1159
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,600
This game is so easy.

1160
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:17,700
The only man I'm allowed
to cheat on you with.

1161
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:19,700
- John Grisham.
- Yes!

1162
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:23,600
- Mexican dude.
- Ricardo Montealban.

1163
01:01:23,635 --> 01:01:24,500
- Yes!
- Time.

1164
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,500
- Right here. Right here!
- Come on!

1165
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,665
Okay, this is like
an animal attack video.

1166
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:33,700
Guys there's other people
on this table, uncomfortable.

1167
01:01:33,735 --> 01:01:35,500
Stop. Oh, God.

1168
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,600
You guys got a lot.
How many was that?

1169
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:39,665
- Seven.
- Seven.

1170
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:41,600
- Pollie, can you do the buzzer?
- Oh, yeah!

1171
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:43,700
We can do this, baby.
You ready?

1172
01:01:43,735 --> 01:01:44,665
Yeah.

1173
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,600
Okay let's light a fire. Let's light a fire.

1174
01:01:46,635 --> 01:01:48,500
- Ready? Go!
- Okay.

1175
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:50,700
This is the thing, I'm most
scared of in the whole world.

1176
01:01:50,735 --> 01:01:51,665
- Snakes.
- No, no, no.

1177
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:54,700
- The thing I'm most scared of.
- Jump-jumps! 4 year-olds.

1178
01:01:54,735 --> 01:01:56,700
More than anything, this
scares me to my core.

1179
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,600
You got to come up with
a differnet... Use a lifeline.

1180
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:01,600
- Ask the audience
- Spiders, Brad. I'm scared of spiders.

1181
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:03,665
Sweetheart, you don't
have to say the answer.

1182
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:07,500
You can say an "eight-legged
animal" or a "superhero"...

1183
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,800
- Can't say superhero!
- Mom, I'm not actually the one with the...

1184
01:02:09,835 --> 01:02:10,700
Try again.

1185
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:14,500
Okay, in high-school,
my senior year spring break...

1186
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:17,600
I was in Cancun, and I was wearing
this bikini top, I'd lost all this weight...

1187
01:02:17,635 --> 01:02:19,700
- Tourists. Skinny.
- No, no, no.

1188
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:21,700
- Thin?
- No, I was standing at the bar.

1189
01:02:21,735 --> 01:02:23,565
- I was shaking around...
- Dancer.

1190
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,700
- My stuff fell out and then all the bar tenders...
- Your what fell out?

1191
01:02:25,735 --> 01:02:26,765
My stuff fell out.

1192
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:29,600
Everybody would call me
when I went to the bar and say

1193
01:02:29,635 --> 01:02:30,600
"Oh, here comes... "

1194
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:34,800
Peek-a-boo.

1195
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:37,665
Peek-a-boo.

1196
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:40,565
Okay, honey, you can say,
like, "look" or...

1197
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,700
- Can't say "look".
- Okay, mom I'm not the one with the card.

1198
01:02:42,735 --> 01:02:44,667
I'm giving examples.
I have a thing here.

1199
01:02:44,702 --> 01:02:46,600
- You see this...
- Can't say, "see"!

1200
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:47,800
I'm explaining the game.

1201
01:02:47,835 --> 01:02:49,500
Can't say "game"!

1202
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,800
Mom, the answer's been said.
She said the answer.

1203
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:53,800
- Let's just do the next one.
- Okay.

1204
01:02:53,835 --> 01:02:55,665
- Let's... you know?
- I get it.

1205
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:58,700
Okay, so this is something
that you would eat...

1206
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,700
- and you put it on a barbecue and...
- Chicken.

1207
01:03:01,735 --> 01:03:02,700
- It's my favorite.
- Beef.

1208
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:03,765
You can't say, "beef"!

1209
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:05,665
Mom, I'm not the
one saying the things!

1210
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:08,600
- Do you get that? Just shush.
- You can't say, "shush. "

1211
01:03:08,635 --> 01:03:09,765
Okay, Mom,
I can say "shush. "

1212
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,700
- You can't say "shush. "
- Okay Lets just move on... Kebab.

1213
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:13,600
It's kebab.

1214
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:15,700
It says I can't say "shish"!

1215
01:03:15,735 --> 01:03:17,800
Shish. Shish. Shish.

1216
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:19,665
And I could say it,
because, I don't have it.

1217
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:22,700
and that's why, there's this thing
here so that I can't see what it is.

1218
01:03:22,735 --> 01:03:24,500
Let's just move on.
Let's just move on.

1219
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:26,700
Our time's up.

1220
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:30,665
What's this attitude, Brad?

1221
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:32,565
I don't have an attitude.
I've shut down.

1222
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,765
She buzzes me,
I'm trying to explain to you...

1223
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:37,200
how to play the game, you
obviously don't understand

1224
01:03:37,235 --> 01:03:39,600
the best ways to play the
game and I'm shutting down.

1225
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,600
I wanna talk to you
about something.

1226
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:02,800
Baby, I know what you want
to talk to me, about me.

1227
01:04:02,835 --> 01:04:03,765
You do?

1228
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:06,565
I don't want you to apologize
for it because, love...

1229
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:09,500
means never having to say that your,
sorry. You know what I mean?

1230
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,500
For the record,
I do forgive you.

1231
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:13,700
But the thing is when you're
playing a board game...

1232
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:17,600
you shouldn't go so conceptual,
you do want to go a lot more literal.

1233
01:04:17,635 --> 01:04:18,700
- Look how else will you know...?
- No, Brad.

1234
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,700
I took a pregnancy test today.

1235
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:22,700
You took what?

1236
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,600
I took a pregnancy test today.

1237
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:28,665
At my mom's house.
It was in my sister's bag...

1238
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:30,600
I was in the bathroom, and
I'd been a couple of days late

1239
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,600
so I just thought I should
probably take a test.

1240
01:04:33,635 --> 01:04:35,665
- Honey, you pulled the goalie?
- What?

1241
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:38,900
You can't pull the goalie without checking
with your team mate, this is insane.

1242
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,800
I did not pull the goalie. That's not
what this conversation is about.

1243
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:42,800
What are you talking about?
What am I missing here?

1244
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:45,765
Relax, Brad. It was negative.
I'm not pregnant.

1245
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:48,800
Well jeez, why don't you just hit
me with that right from the start?

1246
01:04:48,835 --> 01:04:51,800
Instead of making me take laps
around the anxiety pool.

1247
01:04:51,835 --> 01:04:53,565
What is this reaction?

1248
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,600
Listen, If there's one
thing we've learned

1249
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:57,600
by being forced to being
around our families today

1250
01:04:57,635 --> 01:04:59,700
it's about the dangers
of procreating.

1251
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:02,700
Besides, that's not the
things that we want in life.

1252
01:05:02,735 --> 01:05:04,665
Brad, I realized it today.

1253
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:06,500
I thought for sure, I'd
always known that

1254
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,700
I didn't want to have kids
and I took this test,

1255
01:05:08,735 --> 01:05:10,767
I'm waiting to see if it's
positive or negative

1256
01:05:10,802 --> 01:05:12,800
and I thought,
for just a second. I felt...

1257
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:16,600
different. You know?
I felt hopeful.

1258
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,565
Like maybe it would
just happen and

1259
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:21,600
we'd be forced to get
over all of our fears.

1260
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:23,765
We have spent so
much of our relationship

1261
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:26,600
creating all these boundaries you
know, and making sure that

1262
01:05:26,635 --> 01:05:28,765
we don't limit ourselves
with responsibility...

1263
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:31,500
and obligation, and I don't
wanna live like that anymore.

1264
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:32,700
Because that's not loving at all.

1265
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:35,665
- Is that an eighties song?
- No, Brad.

1266
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:38,700
- Your throwing, eighties songs at me?
- I'm tired of being one foot in.

1267
01:05:38,735 --> 01:05:40,700
I want us to be open,
to love each other...

1268
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,800
however it's going to be.
and if one day that means...

1269
01:05:42,835 --> 01:05:44,765
we get married or
if we have kids one day

1270
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:47,800
I feel like that's okay.
I wanna be in a relationship...

1271
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:50,600
that goes where
it needs to go.

1272
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:53,665
Okay. And I'd like the
relationship to go to, Fiji.

1273
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:56,800
Brad, this is very important.
I wanna have this conversation.

1274
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:59,700
I don't want to have this conversation.
I don't wanna have it.

1275
01:05:59,735 --> 01:06:01,800
I feel the same way that
I did when we first met,

1276
01:06:01,835 --> 01:06:03,767
and I've been honest
the whole time.

1277
01:06:03,802 --> 01:06:05,701
I don't want a
conversation about it

1278
01:06:05,736 --> 01:06:07,600
because I don't
want those things.

1279
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:13,800
Okay.

1280
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:43,600
It's okay, you
don't have to come in.

1281
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,500
Sweetheart, I'm not going to make
you go into the house by yourself.

1282
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,500
I'm fine. I'll just have my sister
drive me back to the city.

1283
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,600
We'll go in there together
and I'll drive you home.

1284
01:06:52,635 --> 01:06:53,700
I'm not gonna go
and in there and pretend

1285
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,700
we're something that we're
not, Brad. I can't do that anymore.

1286
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,665
Baby, listen to me, please.

1287
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:00,700
Okay let's not over
react to this situation here.

1288
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:03,600
I'm not over
reacting, Brad. I get it.

1289
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:05,800
I'm the one changing
the rules.

1290
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:09,700
and If you don't want to change
them with me, I understand.

1291
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,500
I just can't do this anymore.

1292
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:46,500
Honey?

1293
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:47,800
Coming in?

1294
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:51,600
Hey, Dad.

1295
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:53,700
She made it!

1296
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,500
Auntie, Kate!
Auntie, Kate!

1297
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:57,765
Merry christmas again!

1298
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:59,665
Hi, Kasi.
Merry christmas.

1299
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:02,600
Come see the cool stuff
grandpa, Creighton got me!

1300
01:08:02,635 --> 01:08:03,600
Okay.

1301
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:07,100
Hi, I'm, Cheryl. I'm
your dad's girlfriend.

1302
01:08:07,135 --> 01:08:09,500
- Nice to finally meet you.
- Excuse me.

1303
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:11,765
- Hey, Kate!
- Hi, Mom.

1304
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,800
I got a, Dora the Explorer backpack...

1305
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:19,600
a matching, Dora thermos,
a big girl necklace...

1306
01:08:19,635 --> 01:08:20,800
and princess shoes!

1307
01:08:20,835 --> 01:08:22,500
Hey, guys!

1308
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,500
Hi, Auntie, Kate.
Where's, Brad?

1309
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:29,700
Kasi, why don't you go
tell grandpa thanks...

1310
01:08:29,735 --> 01:08:30,765
for all your new toys?

1311
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:33,600
You'd better go or
I'm going to tickle.

1312
01:08:33,635 --> 01:08:34,500
Go!

1313
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:38,800
This is amazing.

1314
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:40,700
Dad and Mom
in the same room?

1315
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:42,600
They hated each other.

1316
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:46,700
Well they've been getting together
for stuff since, Kasi turned one.

1317
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,600
It must be really nice
for, Kasi.

1318
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:54,500
It's really nice for everyone.

1319
01:08:55,500 --> 01:09:00,700
- Where is, Brad?
- He's not going to make it.

1320
01:09:00,735 --> 01:09:02,717
But, If it's all the
same to everybody

1321
01:09:02,752 --> 01:09:04,776
I'd really just rather
not talk about it.

1322
01:09:04,811 --> 01:09:06,800
- I'm sorry. I didn't realize...
- It's okay.

1323
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:10,600
It's not something I want
to get into right now.

1324
01:09:10,635 --> 01:09:11,800
Sorry, we won't talk about him.

1325
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:18,500
I have a great idea!
Internet dating.

1326
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:20,000
You should do it. It's great.

1327
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:22,700
You just pay 20 bucks,
and you put in your profile.

1328
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:25,700
Susan, next door, did it and she
found her husband that way.

1329
01:09:25,735 --> 01:09:26,665
It's great.

1330
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:28,700
He doesn't have a job
yet but they're working on it.

1331
01:09:28,735 --> 01:09:29,800
You should totally do it!

1332
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,500
- I'll think about that.
- Yes.

1333
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:34,500
I'm gonna take a
minute and just.

1334
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:37,600
Okay. I got your back.
Gotcha.

1335
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:38,800
Thanks.

1336
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:04,700
Hi, kiddo.

1337
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:07,600
Hey, Dad.

1338
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:13,700
Did, Brad leave
to get a jumpstart

1339
01:10:13,735 --> 01:10:15,700
on inoculating babies
in, Burma?

1340
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:17,765
What?

1341
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,700
Maybe he's making
sock monkeys

1342
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,700
for foster kids.

1343
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:24,700
Or weaving ponchos
for pregnant women

1344
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:25,800
in the, Yucatan?

1345
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:30,700
So, I guess you knew
we were lying?

1346
01:10:30,735 --> 01:10:31,700
Oh, boy.

1347
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,800
Unfortunately, I've had
a lot of experience

1348
01:10:35,835 --> 01:10:39,600
bending the truth
to avoid my family.

1349
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,800
And I'll tell you, honey.
I would give anything...

1350
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,700
to have that time
back again.

1351
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:50,700
I would too.

1352
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:56,700
It's taken me a lot of years

1353
01:10:57,700 --> 01:11:00,800
and several divorces
to learn that

1354
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:04,800
nothing really beats
being honest.

1355
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:09,600
Honest about who you are,
what you need...

1356
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:12,500
all the rest tends
to work itself out.

1357
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:16,600
I was honest...

1358
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:18,700
and I think he was too.

1359
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,700
It just wasn't what
I wanted to hear.

1360
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,200
Cheryl made the
dressing I like so much

1361
01:11:48,235 --> 01:11:49,800
and I did some of the
cooking too, I even

1362
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,800
I put the ice cubes
in the glasses

1363
01:11:52,835 --> 01:11:54,700
and salt in the saltshakers.

1364
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,500
All right, well.

1365
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:01,600
Not long ago, I wouldn't
have been able to...

1366
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:03,700
to put this group
of people together...

1367
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:05,600
in my wildest imagination.

1368
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,600
The changes we've
all been through

1369
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:11,700
the little hurts we've
given each other

1370
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:14,600
we hope we're
forgiven for them.

1371
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:17,600
We thank you, dear, lord

1372
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:22,500
because there's nothing
more important than family.

1373
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:25,600
- Amen.
- Amen.

1374
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:26,700
Amen.

1375
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:47,800
What the hell
do you want?

1376
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:50,700
You forgot your tampons?

1377
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:57,500
No, I didn't forget anything.

1378
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:01,600
I just came by to see you.

1379
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:02,700
What for?

1380
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,600
You already destroyed
my, TV and family room.

1381
01:13:05,635 --> 01:13:07,800
You want to bust up
my kitchen as well?

1382
01:13:07,835 --> 01:13:09,665
Look, I'm sorry
about that, Dad.

1383
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:11,700
I didn't mean to do all of that,
I was actuall just trying to...

1384
01:13:11,735 --> 01:13:13,600
Where's tiny?
She didn't come?

1385
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:16,600
Oh, Kate uh...

1386
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,600
she's not with me.

1387
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:22,800
She finally smelled the
pathetic on you, did she?

1388
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:26,100
No. In fact, she said
she wanted to get

1389
01:13:26,135 --> 01:13:28,700
more serious with me.
She said that

1390
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:31,565
you know,
she loved me

1391
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,600
and she wanted to see herself
having a family with me

1392
01:13:34,635 --> 01:13:35,700
having kids with me.

1393
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:40,600
Well congratulations. That's
what you want to hear?

1394
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:43,600
- I said no, Dad.
- You what?

1395
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:48,600
Yeah, I told her I didn't
want to get married.

1396
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:55,500
- Are you shitting me?
- Uh-uh.

1397
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,700
I'll be damned.
I'll be damned.

1398
01:13:58,735 --> 01:14:00,500
That's my boy.

1399
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:04,700
I always said you were
the smart one, Lando.

1400
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:08,600
Your mind and spirit
are strong, like mine.

1401
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:11,665
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1402
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:14,600
I tell ya. It's always the one
you fight with the most

1403
01:14:14,635 --> 01:14:15,800
who is the most like you.

1404
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:20,665
Well why are we
standing out here for?

1405
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:22,700
Let's go inside, have a
drink. Just the two of us.

1406
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,665
Man to man.
Father to son.

1407
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:26,800
- Alright. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1408
01:14:26,835 --> 01:14:28,500
You're a big boy now.

1409
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:30,500
Let's go in.

1410
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,600
Take appraisal of the
damage you've done.

1411
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:42,600
Would anyone like
anything else?

1412
01:14:42,635 --> 01:14:45,700
- No, no.
- This one's out.

1413
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:49,565
Dad, can you check
on, Jackson?

1414
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,700
- Yeah. The blanket.
- He's got the pillow.

1415
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:53,600
- This is hers?
- Yeah.

1416
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:11,700
Hey.

1417
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:17,700
Okay, listen.

1418
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:21,600
If you get one, you might as well
get two 'cause they're like dogs.

1419
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,565
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about, kids.

1420
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:26,700
If you leave one by itself,
at home, you're never gonna leave.

1421
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,300
'cause you're gonna feel so guilty about
leaving it there by itself.

1422
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:31,800
But if there's two, you don't feel
bad they got someone to play with.

1423
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:33,765
The other big thing to
think about is, school.

1424
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:36,700
Do you send them to private school?
Because then you got sweater vests

1425
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:39,600
and lacrosse coming at you all day.
But if you go to a public school

1426
01:16:39,635 --> 01:16:41,700
you got to worry about some
art student, who's hyperactive

1427
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:44,800
who's all hopped up on medication,
who might try to shank the little guy,

1428
01:16:44,835 --> 01:16:46,565
and that's uncomfortable too.

1429
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:49,800
Are you having this conversation with me, because
you're comfortable having this conversation with me?

1430
01:16:49,835 --> 01:16:52,700
Or are you just having this conversation,
because you wanna go to, Fiji?

1431
01:16:52,735 --> 01:16:53,700
I wanna go to, Fiji.

1432
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:55,750
Because the tickets
are already paid for

1433
01:16:55,785 --> 01:16:58,692
and the hotel rooms
aren't transferable.

1434
01:16:58,727 --> 01:17:01,565
But, honey, I do
feel comfortable now

1435
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:04,500
I think having this conversation
because in my heart

1436
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:06,665
I know I've found
the one person in life

1437
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:09,600
that I want to have
these conversations with.

1438
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:10,800
And that person's you.

1439
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:13,600
- I love you so much.
- Come here.

1440
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:22,600
So it's like, this doesn't mean
we're getting married

1441
01:17:22,635 --> 01:17:24,500
- or having kids right away.
- No, no, no.

1442
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:26,765
But we should talk about it,
because these things do happen.

1443
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:30,500
Not that we're planning on it. We're just talking
about it, because these things happens.

1444
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:32,765
And if we do have them,
then, you know...

1445
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:35,800
- there's a lot of advantages.
- Yeah. They wonderful,

1446
01:17:35,835 --> 01:17:37,817
I mean, they give
you love, unconditionally.

1447
01:17:37,852 --> 01:17:39,800
Also, they're like little
walking tax shelters.

1448
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:41,765
Because you can
write a lot of stuff off.

1449
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:44,500
Yeah, and not to mention all the
yard work. You save so much money.

1450
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:47,600
I mean, once they become a certain age,
we're not gonna have them on the lawnmower.

1451
01:17:47,635 --> 01:17:49,600
- When they're seven.
- I know what your talking about, not slave labor.

1452
01:17:49,635 --> 01:17:51,565
- No, no, no.
- We're talking about teaching them discipline.

1453
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:54,600
- Chores for money.
- And we're not like even planning for like our future.

1454
01:17:54,635 --> 01:17:57,700
We would've ended up living in some
home playing Bingo in, Florida.

1455
01:17:57,735 --> 01:17:58,800
But now we can
live with them.

1456
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,600
- They're gonna sell us out.
- This is exciting. We never thought about it like this.

1457
01:18:02,635 --> 01:18:04,600
Honey, I want you to feel
comfortable to talk to me

1458
01:18:04,635 --> 01:18:06,700
about anything you
want to talk about.

1459
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,600
Unless there's like, you know a
play-off's game or something like that.

1460
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:12,700
You know what I mean? We
can find an appropriate time.

1461
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:15,565
- I'm kidding. Kind of.
- Okay, babe.

1462
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,600
Listen, just to be clear,
this doesn't mean

1463
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:19,565
that we're getting
married right away

1464
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,600
or having kids right away.
just means that we're open

1465
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:23,700
to let love grow
where it wants to grow.

1466
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:26,500
- Exactly.
- We're open to letting it grow.

1467
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:27,600
But, it doesn't mean kids.

1468
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:33,500
- Wow, I can't believe we did it.
- We did.

1469
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:37,700
I don't even know what happened,
I can't even remember the procedure

1470
01:18:37,735 --> 01:18:40,600
but here's this beautiful
thing here. You know what I mean?

1471
01:18:40,635 --> 01:18:43,117
I did feel
like an air traffic controller.

1472
01:18:43,152 --> 01:18:45,600
Between the huffs,
and the signals and stuff

1473
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:47,600
it just kind of all
happened. But, god.

1474
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:50,500
It's awesome, baby.
You're so awesome.

1475
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,650
You were amazing.
You were like this.

1476
01:18:52,685 --> 01:18:54,665
- Thanks, babe.
- We have a baby!

1477
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:57,465
- How's she doing?
- Good. She's sleeping.

1478
01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:00,150
Just wanted to let you and
our little new year's baby know

1479
01:19:00,185 --> 01:19:02,800
that you're welcome to start
bringing in family members now.

1480
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,500
- Oh that's not gonna happen.
- No, no family.

1481
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:07,800
Your families don't
know you had a baby?

1482
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:11,600
To be honest, I think they'd be shocked
to even hear that, Kate was even pregnant.

1483
01:19:11,635 --> 01:19:13,565
Our families can be
a little much sometimes.

1484
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:16,600
I like to think that we're
keeping it special for us

1485
01:19:16,635 --> 01:19:18,700
rather than not
including them.

1486
01:19:18,735 --> 01:19:19,800
Happy New Year, Bay Area!

1487
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:22,565
We are here live
at Pacific General

1488
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:24,700
where the first baby of the
new year, has just been born!

1489
01:19:24,735 --> 01:19:27,500
Let's go say hello
to those lucky parents!

1490
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:29,565
Congratulations, McVie family

1491
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:31,700
on having the first baby
of the, new year!

1492
01:19:31,735 --> 01:19:33,500
Dad, how does it feel?

1493
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,500
We're doing great.

1494
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:44,700
And there was a... a vacuum.

1495
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,000
And then there was, umm...

1496
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:51,565
stretching and the juices.

1497
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:54,700
What he's trying to say is that
we're just beyond words, excited.

1498
