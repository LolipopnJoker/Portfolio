(rock and roll music)

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,706
- Whose idea was this, anyway?

18
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:31,539
- They're gaining on us!

19
00:01:31,542 --> 00:01:33,203
(speaking in foreign language)

20
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:36,780

(thudding)

22
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:39,289
- [Mitch] Shit.

23
00:01:40,542 --> 00:01:41,372
(laughing)

24
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:42,581

27
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,282

(rock and roll music)

29
00:01:57,167 --> 00:01:58,623
- He's after me!

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,037
(groaning)

32
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:05,703
- Phil!

33

(glass crashing)

34
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:07,705
- Wow!

35
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:08,572
- [Both] Wow!

36
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:11,541
(rock and roll music)

37
00:02:11,542 --> 00:02:12,827
- Oh, shit.

38
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,950
(rock and roll music)

39
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:20,493
- [Ed] Jesus!

40
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,660
(screaming)

41
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:24,124

(laughing)

44
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:33,956
- Ed!

45
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:35,698
- Go, Mitch!

46
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:36,618
- Ah!

47
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:37,580
Ah, oh!

48
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:40,746
(rock and roll music)

49
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:46,405
Back, bull, back, bull, back, bull!

50
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:48,203
(bull bellowing)

51
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,664
Stop following me!

00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,536
(bull bellowing)

53
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:56,327
Please!

00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,244
(screaming)

84
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:40,663
- Oops!

85
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:41,656
- Does he know what he's doing?

86
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:43,157
Does he have any idea what he's doing?

87
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:44,498
Because, you know, I can't talk to him.

88
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,489
Ow!

89
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,330
- Relax.

90
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,743
He's doing a beautiful job.

91
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,660
- Sir.

92
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:50,248
El doctor.

93
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,410
Hello!

94
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,742
Don't sew up anything that's
supposed to remain open, okay?

95
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,535
- Okay.

96
00:05:58,792 --> 00:05:59,622
(sighs)

97
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,455
(camera clicking)

98
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:01,823
- What, are you taking pictures, Phil?

99
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:02,663
- Are you kidding?

100
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:04,248
This is a Kodak moment.

101
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,535
Now, smile.

102
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:06,372
(camera clicking)

103
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,205
- Oops!
- Oh, good,

104
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,539
blind him with the flash.

105
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:12,785
- Phil, let the man keep what's
left of his dignity, please.

106
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:13,622
- Dignity.

107
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:14,910
This is all your fault, Ed.

108
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:15,872
- My fault?

109
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,536
- Yeah, because you're a macho lunatic.

110
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:18,657
Phil and I are sheep.

111
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:19,497
- [Phil] We're not sheep.

112
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,330
- We are sheep.

113
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,369
We do every stupid thing he asks.

114
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,865
- I didn't make you run.

115
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,161
- No, it was a 2,000-pound
rampaging animal

116
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:28,249
spraying bull snot all over Spain.

117
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,410
That's what made me run.

118
00:06:29,417 --> 00:06:30,782
You made me stand in front of it.

119
00:06:30,792 --> 00:06:32,623
- Come on, guys, group shot.

120
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:33,956
(bleeping)

121
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:36,700
- I got a big "I told you so"
coming from Barbara on this.

122
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,164
(bleeping)
- Maybe she won't notice.

123
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:41,785
(camera clicking)

124
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:43,748
(Mitch groans)

125
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,739
- Honey, want a pillow?

126
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,160
It's a long flight.

127
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:47,031
- No, thanks.

128
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,206
- Come on, it's not that bad.

129
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,368
I look like your mother.

130
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,831
(Ed and Kim laugh)

131
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,289
- [Ed] Here comes Mr. Bull.

132
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:57,122
(laughing)

133
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:57,955
- [Kim] Yeah.

134
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,823
- Kim, baby, do you want the
aisle seat or the window seat?

135
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,789
Because whichever one
you want makes me happy.

136
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:03,498
- I don't care.
- Good, then take the window.

137
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,330
I wanna talk to Mitch.

138
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:05,118
- Okay.

139
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:06,906
Be right back.

140
00:07:06,917 --> 00:07:07,702
- Miss me.

141
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,957
Admit it, pal, you had fun.

142
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,073
- No-

143
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,698
Scuba diving is fun.

144
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:14,538
I mean, it's normal.

145
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:15,622
People do that.

146
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:16,865
Baseball fantasy camp,

147
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:19,287
until Phil threw up on
Willie Mays, was fabulous.

148
00:07:19,292 --> 00:07:21,533
- I was nervous, he was my idol.

149
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:22,702
- I'll never forget Willie's face.

150
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,619
"Say hey, that's lunch on me!"

151
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,456
(laughing)

152
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,164
- Phil, I'm standing.

153
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,698
- Yes, dear.

154
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:31,538
- [Arlene] I can't wait to get out

155
00:07:31,542 --> 00:07:33,123
of this country, these people.

156
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,161
- You know, maybe it's just me,

157
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,657
but I think our little adventures lately

158
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:39,329
are becoming stupid, you know?

159
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:41,914
What did you call them?

160
00:07:41,917 --> 00:07:43,873
- Desperate attempt to
cling to your youth?

161
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:44,910
- Yeah, that.

162
00:07:44,917 --> 00:07:46,157
- That's bullshit.

163
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:46,997
- Bullshit?

164
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,490
Ed, have you noticed the older you get,

165
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,036
the younger your girlfriends get?

166
00:07:50,042 --> 00:07:51,452
Soon, you'll be dating sperm.

167
00:07:52,792 --> 00:07:53,622
- [Kim] I'm back.

168
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:54,580
- Okay.

169
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,244
I have just one more thing to say.

170
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,240
Target parachute jumping.

171
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,080
- Ed!

172
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,914
- Now, it's a smaller parachute,

173
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:03,623
but you're traveling twice as fast.

174
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,286
- Great! So when they find your body,

175
00:08:05,292 --> 00:08:07,453
they can bury it in a Sucrets box.

176
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:08,538
- Phil said he'd go.

177
00:08:08,542 --> 00:08:09,998
- Phil wants to die.

178
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,072
I mean, if you were married
to that, you'd wanna die, too.

179
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:13,913
Look at him.

180
00:08:13,917 --> 00:08:14,747
He's pretending to be asleep

181
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,286
so he doesn't have to talk to her.

182
00:08:16,292 --> 00:08:18,624
- It's a couple of little
jumps from a plane.

183
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:19,740
- And then what?

184
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,036
We go on safari, only
the animals have guns

185
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:23,202
and they hunt us?

186
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,493
- Forget about it.

187
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,456
- It's never enough for you, Ed.

188
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:27,243
- I'm reading.

189
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,615
- When's it ever gonna be enough?

190
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:32,992
(soft piano music)

191
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,533
(phone ringing)

192
00:08:44,292 --> 00:08:45,327
Hi, Mom.

193
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,665
(Mitch's mother laughs)

194
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:52,536
- [Mitch's Mother] It's
September 8th, 1952.

195
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:54,783
We're driving back from your Aunt Marsha.

196
00:08:54,792 --> 00:08:56,123
My water breaks.

197
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,865
Your father jumps the divider

198
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,411
of the Saw Mill River Parkway

199
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:02,534
and races me to Doctors' Hospital and...

200
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,284
(laughing)

201
00:09:05,292 --> 00:09:08,614
At 5:16, out you came.

202
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,240
Oh.

203
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,616
Happy birthday, darling.

204
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:15,743
Here's your father.

205
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,911
- [Mitch's Father] Hello,
boy, happy birthday.

206
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:19,327
- Hi, Dad, how are you?

207
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,574
- [Mitch's Father] I'm losing
feeling in my left leg.

208
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:22,413
Here's your mother.

209
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:24,499
- [Mitch's Mother] Don't worry, he's fine.

210
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,287
So, what are you gonna
do now, birthday boy?

211
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:29,873
- Well, I thought I'd
lie here another three

212
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,740
and a half hours and then go to work.

213
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,411
- [Mitch's Mother] Is Barbara with you?

214
00:09:33,417 --> 00:09:34,406
- No, she's working the streets

215
00:09:34,417 --> 00:09:36,248
and she likes to have
breakfast with her pimp.

216
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,956
She should be in around 7:30.

217
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,368
- Hi, Mom.

218
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,912
- [Mitch's Mother] Give my boy a kiss, oh.

219
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:43,578
(sobbing)

220
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:48,373
I can't believe my baby's 39 years old.

221
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,616
(crying)

222
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:51,865
- Bye, Mom.

223
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:52,955
- [Mitch's Mother] Oh...

224
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,164
Bye...

225
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:56,829
Angel, birthday boy.

226
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:57,618
Oh!

227
00:09:58,667 --> 00:09:59,497
- Happy birthday.

228
00:10:07,417 --> 00:10:09,373
(sighs)

229
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,662
- Well, at least she said my age in years.

230
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:16,124
Usually, she uses months,
like I'm still an infant.

231
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:16,955
"How's Mitch?"

232
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,290
"Oh, good, he's 168 months today."

233
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:21,368
Wow.

234
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:24,657
I look a year older.

235
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:26,532
Do I look a year older to you?

236
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:30,785
- Honey, at 5:15 everybody
looks a year older.

237
00:10:30,792 --> 00:10:32,623
- Do you know what I found yesterday?

238
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:33,455
- [Barbara] Hm.

239
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:34,789
- Hair in my ear.

240
00:10:34,792 --> 00:10:35,622
- [Barbara] Mitch.

241
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,490
- I'm losing hair where I
want hair and I'm getting hair

242
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,365
where there shouldn't be hair.

243
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,331
I found four big fat ones on my back.

244
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,415
I'm starting to look like The Fly.

245
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:47,365
- That's it, I'm canceling
your birthday party.

246
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,490
- Why?

247
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,411
- [Barbara] Because your
birthdays depress you.

248
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:51,327
- No, they don't.

249
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,664
- Oh, Mitch.

250
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:55,283
On your 30th birthday you
said you couldn't see.

251
00:10:55,292 --> 00:10:56,873
And then on your 34th birthday,

252
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,911
you forgot my name for an hour.

253
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:02,159
Then last year, when I
asked you what you wanted,

254
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:04,123
you said a CAT scan.

255
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,911
- I had a headache.

256
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:08,249
- This year, let's just let it pass.

257
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,241
- I wanna see my friends.

258
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,330
- All right.

259
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,574
But I don't want people
coming over here thinking

260
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,323
they're in a Bergman film.

261
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,415
You've met my husband, Mr. Death?

262
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,865
- I'll be good.

263
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,081
- Yeah?

264
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,540
Because I don't need you
any worse than you've been.

265
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:26,907
- Wait a second, what does that mean?

266
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:29,124
- [Barbara] Nothing.

267
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:29,910
- Nothing.

268
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,785
Great.

269
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:34,703
(sighs)

270
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:35,493
Oh.

271
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,038
Ah.

272
00:11:42,042 --> 00:11:45,489
(soft instrumental music)

273
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:30,623
- Got a minute?

274
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,619
- Hi. I only have a few minutes.

275
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,206
I have career day at
Danny's school, so, I--

276
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,823
- Yeah, it'll just take a second.

277
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,289
(lively music)
- What is it?

278
00:12:43,292 --> 00:12:44,782
J‘ Pizza Guys, Pizza Guys J”

279
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:46,532
J‘ Come on down to Pizza Guys J‘

280
00:12:46,542 --> 00:12:48,123
I Be a happy, healthy fellow J‘

281
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,116
I Have some sauce and mozzarella J‘

282
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,286
J‘ At Pizza Guys J‘

283
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:53,452
- So?

284
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:54,823
- So.

285
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,415
So, it's stupid.

286
00:12:57,417 --> 00:12:58,406
It's annoying.

287
00:12:58,417 --> 00:13:01,250
It makes people change the station.

288
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,160
- I didn't write it.

289
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:03,031
- But you bought it.

290
00:13:03,042 --> 00:13:06,000
You put it on the air three
times a night during drive time.

291
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,365
People are having accidents.

292
00:13:16,792 --> 00:13:19,499
You used to go out and get advertising.

293
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,330
You hustled.

294
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,698
You were creative.

295
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,994
Something bad came in, you fixed it.

296
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,830
You rewrote it.

297
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,369
You worked with it.

298
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,582
My God, we used to make fun of guys

299
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,073
who bought crap like this.

300
00:13:31,917 --> 00:13:33,123
What's going on with you?

301
00:13:35,042 --> 00:13:37,158
- Did you ever reach a point in your life

302
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:38,913
where you say to yourself,

303
00:13:38,917 --> 00:13:41,078
"This is the best I'm ever gonna look,

304
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,914
"the best I'm ever gonna feel,

305
00:13:42,917 --> 00:13:45,158
"the best I'm ever gonna do,

306
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:46,452
"and it ain't that great?"

307
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,535
- Happy birthday.

308
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:50,743
- Thank you.

309
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,947
- Now, look, I'm the station manager.

310
00:13:55,958 --> 00:14:00,782
I'm responsible for the quality
of work here at the station.

311
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:01,952
So, till further notice,

312
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,700
I have to insist on personally
approving all the new spots.

313
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:05,538
- What?

314
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:08,158
I can't make a deal without
checking with you first?

315
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:09,828
- Just till you get back on track.

316
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,787
- So we're doing this job on 60th and 3rd,

317
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:18,283
big frigging ballbreaker of a job, right?

318
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:19,623
And we got the area roped off,
(kids laughing)

319
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,707
you know, so that some schmuck
don't walk through there

320
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,448
and take a wrecking ball between the eyes.

321
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,289
(kids laughing)

322
00:14:25,292 --> 00:14:28,034
All of a sudden, this woman,
you know, with the big,

323
00:14:28,042 --> 00:14:30,408
dark glasses, the Bloomingdale's bags,

324
00:14:30,417 --> 00:14:32,658
she starts walking
right through the ropes.

325
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:33,577
I yelled down at her,

326
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:36,165
"Hey, you can't go
there, you stupid bitch!"

327
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,156
(kids laughing)

328
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:40,614
And suddenly, this big
steam fitting bursts

329
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,992
and this enormous goddamn
crane crashes right down

330
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,994
on her legs, and she's
screaming, "My legs, my legs!"

331
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,865
And I say, "No shit, your legs.

332
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,537
"You got a 2,000-pound
goddamn crane on them."

333
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:55,373
(kids laughing)

334
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:58,287
Now, do you know how, in an
emergency, you could get,

335
00:14:58,292 --> 00:15:00,829
like, superhuman strength?

336
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,950
I reach down and I lift this crane,

337
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,745
and Ernesto's able to
slide her out from under,

338
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,617
and the doctors were
able to save her legs.

339
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:13,243
So the moral is: don't walk
where you're not supposed

340
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,206
to walk because there may not be somebody

341
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,665
with superhuman strength
to save your little ass.

342
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,658
(kids laughing)

343
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:21,032
And don't do drugs.

344
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,581
That's it.

345
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:27,199
(kids cheering)

346
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:30,990
- Thank you, Mr. Morelli.

347
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,197
That was very descriptive.

348
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:38,784
Daniel, would you introduce
your father, please,

349
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:40,157
and tell us what he does?

350
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,745
- My dad's named Mitch and he's...

351
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,866
He's a submarine commander.

352
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:49,864
(kids gasp)

353
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:50,705
- Danny!

354
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:51,993
- [Boy] Submarine commander?

355
00:15:53,542 --> 00:15:55,999
- He works for WBLM radio.

356
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,864
- [Boy] Ah!

357
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:13,623
- Well, like Danny said,
I work for WBLM radio.

358
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:14,865
- Are you a disc jockey?

359
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,240
- No, I'm not a disc jockey.

360
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:20,282
You know the commercials
that are on the radio?

361
00:16:20,292 --> 00:16:21,122
- Oh!

362
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,706
Do you make all those commercials?

363
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,160
- No-

364
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:27,579
Other people make the commercials.

365
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:30,290
I sell them time on our station

366
00:16:30,292 --> 00:16:32,078
for the commercials to be on.

367
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:35,701
- So you decide which
commercials to use and when?

368
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,073
- That's right.

369
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,243
Well, no, it's not right.

370
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,241
It used to be right.

371
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,866
Seems now that I even have to
check with the station manager

372
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,661
if I wanna wipe my nose.

373
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:47,739
(kids chuckle)

374
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,457
The minute he took away my
authority, I should have quit.

375
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:00,782
- Mr. Robbins?

376
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:02,660
- What?

377
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:06,622
(melancholic instrumental music)

378
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,991
Value this time in your life, kids,

379
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,830
because this is the time in your life

380
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:12,370
when you still have your choices.

381
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,491
It goes by so fast.

382
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,240
When you're a teenager,

383
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,956
you think you can do anything, and you do.

384
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,664
Your twenties are a blur.

385
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:22,534
Thirties, you raise your
family, you make a little money,

386
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,407
and you think to yourself,

387
00:17:24,417 --> 00:17:26,328
"What happened to my twenties?"

388
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:30,121
Forties, you grow a little pot
belly, you grow another chin.

389
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,286
The music starts to get too loud.

390
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:33,247
One of your old girlfriends

391
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,616
from high school becomes a grandmother.

392
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,456
Fifties, you have a minor surgery.

393
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:40,950
You'll call it a procedure,
but it's a surgery.

394
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,664
Sixties, you'll have a major surgery.

395
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:44,532
The music is still loud,
but it doesn't matter

396
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:46,498
because you can't hear it anyway.

397
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,663
Seventies, you and the wife
retire to Fort Lauderdale.

398
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,244
You start eating dinner at
two o'clock in the afternoon,

399
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,083
you have lunch around 10:00,
breakfast the night before.

400
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,495
You spend most of your time
wandering around malls looking

401
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,661
for the ultimate soft
yogurt and muttering,

402
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:01,622
"How come the kids don't call?

403
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,661
"How come the kids don't call?"

404
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:06,500
The eighties, you'll have a major stroke.

405
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,331
You end up babbling to some Jamaican nurse

406
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:11,245
who your wife can't stand
but who you call Mama.

407
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,285
Any questions?

408
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:18,822
Danny was embarrassed to tell
the class what my job is.

409
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:19,993
- They're nine!

410
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,581
They get excited about the guy

411
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,790
who gives them change at the arcade.

412
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,620
You just happen to have one of those jobs

413
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,411
that's difficult to...

414
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:32,909
- Believe that a grown man
does without losing his mind.

415
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,989
I mean, what is my job?

416
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,662
I mean, I sell advertising
time on the radio.

417
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:39,953
So, basically, I sell air.

418
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,494
At least my father was an upholsterer.

419
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,456
He made a sofa, a couch you could sit on.

420
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:44,868
It was something tangible.

421
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,240
What can I point to?

422
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,330
Where's my work?

423
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,163
It's air.

424
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:49,156
I sell air.

425
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:51,203
- What, so what are you saying?

426
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,573
You wanna quit?

427
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:53,993
- How can I quit?

428
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,285
I'm trapped.

429
00:18:55,292 --> 00:18:56,998
- You're trapped?

430
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,830
- Yeah.

431
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,289
The other day you said
you wanna send Holly

432
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:00,532
to a performing arts school.

433
00:19:00,542 --> 00:19:01,657
- She's got talent.

434
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:02,497
- Talent?

435
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,661
She was in one play and
she fell off the stage.

436
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:06,703
That's not talent, that's gravity.

437
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,039
And that school costs money.

438
00:19:08,042 --> 00:19:09,327
Everything costs money.
- Bye!

439
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,914
- [Barbara] Bye.

440
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:11,872
- [Mitch] Where are you going?

441
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,411
- I'm sleeping at Gwen's down the hall.

442
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:14,327
- Again?

443
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,449
Are you paying rent there?

444
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:17,368
- Oh, Dad.

445
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,661
- We're having a birthday party.

446
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:21,749
- I don't wanna sit around
all night with your friends.

447
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,286
- I told her it'd be all right.

448
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:24,998
We'll have a family party tomorrow.

449
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:27,997
(chuckﬁng)

450
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,163
- Bye, Dad.

451
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:31,997
- [Mitch] Bye.

452
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,830
- Happy birthday.

453
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,323
- Thank you.

454
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,994
(melodic music)

455
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,662
- Ah!
(man laughs)

456
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:40,498
Let me show you how I pop my shoulder.

457
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:42,497
(POPPing)

458
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,580
- [Man and Woman] Ouch!

459
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,539
- Danny, Dan, come on, come on.

460
00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:47,407
He's in the gifted program at school.

461
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:49,078
(laughing) Come on, go to sleep, huh?

462
00:19:50,417 --> 00:19:51,657
Kim, you poor thing.

463
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:53,123
What has married life done to you?

464
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,865
I mean, you look like hell!

465
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,206
- Six months.

466
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,699
Admit it, you didn't think
Ed would ever get married.

467
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,073
- Well, he met the right woman.

468
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,869
And how often are you meeting that woman?

469
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,456
- You're lucky it's your birthday, pal.

470
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:04,743
(Kim laughs)

471
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,241
- Excuse me, I see one of
the guests is stealing.

472
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,741
(Kim laughs)

473
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,412
- Your husband is so cute.

474
00:20:12,417 --> 00:20:13,623
You must laugh all day.

475
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,286
- Yeah, my sides hurt.

476
00:20:15,292 --> 00:20:16,122
(laughing)

477
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:19,083
- We saw a picture of you in
a newspaper in your underwear.

478
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,449
- Oh, well, that was an advertisement.

479
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,449
I sometimes model ladies' underwear.

480
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:24,994
- You looked great.

481
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,116
- Mom, you said, "Let's see how she looks

482
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,207
"after having two kids."

483
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,915
(people murmuring)

484
00:20:31,917 --> 00:20:34,158
- Daniel, time to go to bed.

485
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:35,873
We'll wake you for your wedding.

486
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,911
(grunts)

487
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,865
- Phil.

488
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:41,660
Hello.

489
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,072
You're pretending to sleep
at my birthday party.

490
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,573
- Is she around?

491
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:50,165
(people murmuring)

492
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:51,282
- She's in the kitchen.

493
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:56,199
This is quite a life you've
carved out for yourself, Phil.

494
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,869
- Phil!

495
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:58,705
Phil!

496
00:20:58,708 --> 00:20:59,993
We're leaving.

497
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,740
- We haven't had cake.

498
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,786
He hasn't even opened his presents yet.

499
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:06,374
- Phil, you have to
open the store at 4:30.

500
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,331
Daddy's counting on you.

501
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,039
- 15 more minutes?

502
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:12,909
(people murmuring)

503
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:15,372
- Starting now.

504
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,039
(bleeping)

505
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:23,991
(people murmuring)
(melodic music)

506
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,536
- 4:30 in the morning?

507
00:21:26,542 --> 00:21:28,078
- Hey, you know, you manage a supermarket,

508
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,573
that's when the food arrives.

509
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:32,040
- Don't you have an assistant
or a kid or something?

510
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:33,998
- Arlene's father likes me to do it.

511
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,789
"No free rides, Philly boy!

512
00:21:36,792 --> 00:21:38,783
"No free rides."

513
00:21:38,792 --> 00:21:41,784
But I'm telling you,
they got me by the balls.

514
00:21:41,792 --> 00:21:43,578
She's got one, he's got the other.

515
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:46,245
(sighing)

516
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,832
- Do you ever think about quitting?

517
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,494
- Yeah, sure, right.

518
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,535
That's just what I wanna do:

519
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:53,749
start over with two kids to take care of.

520
00:21:55,542 --> 00:21:56,372
No.

521
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:59,242
At this age, where you are, you are.

522
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,535
- Hey, look who's awake.

523
00:22:02,542 --> 00:22:04,658
- Look, I have got 14 minutes, okay?

524
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:05,873
So can we give him the present?

525
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:06,705
- Yeah.

526
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:07,618
- What'd you get me?

527
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:10,914
- Two weeks.

528
00:22:10,917 --> 00:22:12,282
The three of us.

529
00:22:12,292 --> 00:22:13,532
New Mexico.

530
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:14,702
Driving cattle.

531
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:15,993
- What, like in a truck?

532
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,864
- No, no!

533
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:17,955
Cowboys!

534
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:20,324
It's a real old-fashioned cattle drive.

535
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:23,166
- We drive the herd from
New Mexico to Colorado.

536
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:23,997
- You can do this?

537
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,833
- We ride, we rope, we
sleep out under the stars.

538
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:27,948
- Show him the brochure.

539
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:29,323
- It's fantastic, Mitch.

540
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,865
- [Phil] It's the newest
thing, people do this!

541
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:33,990
It's great!

542
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,241
- Wow, look at this.

543
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,490
- Real horses.

544
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,615
- Does look good.

545
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:39,455
- Good?

546
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,288
It's great.

547
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,157
Cowboys, that's what
you always wanted to be.

548
00:22:42,167 --> 00:22:44,078
Remember Mitchy the Kid?

549
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:45,698
- Right, Mitchy the Kid!

550
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:47,744
And it's right when your vacation comes.

551
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,365
We've been planning it for weeks.

552
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:51,618
- I can't do it.

553
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,615
- Why?

554
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,911
- We're going to Florida
to visit Barbara's parents.

555
00:22:57,917 --> 00:22:58,952
- What, are you sick?

556
00:23:00,917 --> 00:23:01,997
- No, it's planned already.

557
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,080
I promised.

558
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:05,665
- I worked every weekend
for a year to get this.

559
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:07,407
What's with you these days?

560
00:23:07,417 --> 00:23:08,907
- Nothing, you know, nothing.

561
00:23:10,917 --> 00:23:12,373
It's just, I...

562
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:14,912
You know, I don't wanna
disappoint Barbara.

563
00:23:14,917 --> 00:23:16,032
(doorbell rings)

564
00:23:16,042 --> 00:23:16,872
Who is that?

565
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:18,957
I know nine people and they're all here.

566
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:20,539
Excuse me.

567
00:23:20,542 --> 00:23:24,205
(people murmuring)

568
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:25,038
- [Barbara] Hi.

569
00:23:25,042 --> 00:23:27,624
- Hi, is Mr. Phil Berquist here?

570
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,331
- [Barbara] Can I get you something to...

571
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:30,163
(dramatic music)

572
00:23:30,167 --> 00:23:32,499
- Mr. Berquist, your housekeeper
told me where you were.

573
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,455
I'm in trouble.

574
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:34,618
- What are you doing here, Nancy?

575
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:36,991
Who's on register nine?
- I don't know what to do.

576
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,830
- Harumaki?

577
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:38,663
- I don't think this is the time

578
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:39,702
or the place to talk about this.

579
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:41,664
- I'm late.
- What?

580
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:43,498
- I missed my period!

581
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,330
- Whoops!

582
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:45,243
What?!

583
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,330
- I was at work and on my break,

584
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:49,370
and I took one of those home
pregnancy tests from aisle 11.

585
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:50,455
- The ones on special?

586
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:51,368
- Yes!

587
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:52,865
And it came up blue.

588
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,287
- Why is she telling you this, Phil?

589
00:23:58,125 --> 00:23:58,955
- Because I'm...

590
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:01,370
I'm her boss and...

591
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:03,240
We have a health plan.

592
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,456
- Son of a bitch!

593
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:07,450
You screwed this little
girl in my father's store?!

594
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:08,288
- No, no, no!

595
00:24:08,292 --> 00:24:10,408
- It was in his car!

596
00:24:10,417 --> 00:24:11,702
- Oh, Jesus!

597
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:14,620
- And I'm not a little girl, I'm 20.

598
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:17,458
- Get out of this house, you little whore.

599
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:18,573
- Hey!

600
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:20,824
I will not permit you
to talk to her that way!

601
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:25,910
- Fine.

602
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:29,490
I'll tell my father what you did!

603
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,364
- No!

604
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:32,286
Do not call Mr. Levine!

605
00:24:32,292 --> 00:24:34,032
Hey, put down that phone!
- Phil.

606
00:24:34,042 --> 00:24:34,872
Put it down.
- No!

607
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:36,786
No.
- Get, get off.

608
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:37,827
- That's my phone!
- You're crazy!

609
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:38,913
- That's right!

610
00:24:38,917 --> 00:24:41,909
Not having sex for 12 years
will do that to a person!

611
00:24:41,917 --> 00:24:43,873
- Now, come on, you two, stop it.

612
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:45,991
Come on, not in front of
your friends. Come on.

613
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,830
(groaning)

614
00:24:46,833 --> 00:24:47,993
- I'm not afraid of you!

615
00:24:49,042 --> 00:24:50,327
(screaming)

616
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:52,073
I'll call from the bedroom!

617
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:52,913
- The bedroom?

618
00:24:52,917 --> 00:24:54,908
How the hell would you
know where the bedroom is?!

619
00:24:54,917 --> 00:24:55,747
- [Arlene] I'm calling!

620
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,660
- Go ahead, call him!

621
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:57,656
I'm sure he's home!

622
00:24:57,667 --> 00:25:00,079
It's his night to meet with
the other escaped Nazis.

623
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:01,948
- [Arlene] I hate you!

624
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,744
- I hate you more!

625
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,662
If hate were people, I'd be China.

626
00:25:14,542 --> 00:25:15,873
- Let's bring out the cake.

627
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:19,991
(clattering)

628
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,490
- Good party.

629
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,285
- It's...

630
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:27,743
- Mitch?

631
00:25:28,958 --> 00:25:31,290
Is that what you've
been trying to tell me?

632
00:25:31,292 --> 00:25:32,657
That you feel like Phil?

633
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:35,281
- Like Phil?

634
00:25:35,292 --> 00:25:37,123
- Yeah, am I gonna be
sitting here some night

635
00:25:37,125 --> 00:25:40,617
and some checkout girl
comes here looking for you?

636
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:43,207
- No, no, of course not.

637
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,789
- I know you're not happy here.

638
00:25:46,417 --> 00:25:48,078
You're not happy at work.

639
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:49,994
I know how men think.

640
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,582
"I'm not happy here, I'm not happy there,

641
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:54,915
"I'll be happy here."

642
00:25:54,917 --> 00:25:55,781
- No-

643
00:25:55,792 --> 00:25:58,374
You make me happy here.

644
00:25:58,375 --> 00:25:59,160
- No-

645
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,491
- No, I make you feel trapped.

646
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,365
- No, you don't, it's not you.

647
00:26:04,375 --> 00:26:05,990
- How do you think that makes me feel

648
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,490
when I hear you say that?

649
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,910
- I didn't mean you.

650
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:10,993
It's me.

651
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:14,493
I...

652
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,330
(dramatic music)

653
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:16,743
I just feel lost.

654
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:26,038
- Kim was telling me about
this cattle drive thing.

655
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,657
- Oh.

656
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:28,873
- Maybe you should go.

657
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,615
- What about Florida?

658
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:33,581
- You'll be miserable in Florida.

659
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:35,039
You'll make me miserable.

660
00:26:35,042 --> 00:26:36,327
You hate my parents.

661
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:37,664
- [Mitch] Look, I don't hate your parents.

662
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:39,532
- Oh, come on, Mitch,
you have known my father

663
00:26:39,542 --> 00:26:40,907
since you were 18 years old

664
00:26:40,917 --> 00:26:43,533
and you've never called him by his name.

665
00:26:43,542 --> 00:26:44,452
- What is his name?

666
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:47,448
It's a joke, I was just joking.

667
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:51,742
Look, I said I'm gonna
go and I'm gonna go.

668
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,911
- You don't understand what I'm saying.

669
00:26:53,917 --> 00:26:55,407
I'm not saying it's all right

670
00:26:55,417 --> 00:26:57,203
if you don't wanna come with us.

671
00:26:57,208 --> 00:26:58,994
(dramatic music)

672
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,412
I'm saying I don't want you to come.

673
00:27:01,417 --> 00:27:04,124
(dramatic music)

674
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:07,907
Go away with Ed.

675
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:11,448
Take Phil.

676
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:14,165
I am giving you these two weeks.

677
00:27:14,167 --> 00:27:15,407
It's my present.

678
00:27:17,208 --> 00:27:19,324
Go and find your smile.

679
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:23,447
- What if I can't?

680
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:29,829
- We'll jump off that
bridge when we come to it.

681
00:27:29,833 --> 00:27:32,540
(dramatic music)

682
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:42,162
(thrilling music)

683
00:27:45,417 --> 00:27:50,366
(men whooping)
(thrilling music)

684
00:28:14,708 --> 00:28:16,744
- My ass hurts just watching this.

685
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,956
- Are you kidding?
(horse neighing)

686
00:28:17,958 --> 00:28:19,038
This is fantastic!

687
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:21,368
- [Man] Take him down, Hoss!

688
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:22,239
(groaning)

689
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:23,831
- I wonder if I could do that to Arlene.

690
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:24,663
(cow mooing)

691
00:28:24,667 --> 00:28:25,952
- Phil, forget about it already.

692
00:28:25,958 --> 00:28:27,323
- I could do it.

693
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:28,413
You've seen her ears.

694
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,452
- They must be the other guests.

695
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:33,744
- [Mitch] I wish you
hadn't worn this jacket.

696
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,580
- Why not?

697
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:35,743
- Why, look at it, it's got your name

698
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,660
and your picture on it.

699
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:37,747
It's a little grotesque.

700
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,240
- I'm proud of what I do.

701
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,080
- So is the president.

702
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:41,789
He doesn't put his picture on his suit.

703
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:43,538
You guys guests here?

704
00:28:43,542 --> 00:28:45,908
- Yeah, we just got here a
minute ago. I'm Mitch Robbins.

705
00:28:45,917 --> 00:28:46,747
- Ed Furillo.

706
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,580
I sell sporting goods.

707
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:48,948
- [Mitch] Show him your jacket.

708
00:28:48,958 --> 00:28:51,040
- Yeah, I'm Phil Berquist.

709
00:28:51,042 --> 00:28:52,452
I committed adultery.

710
00:28:52,458 --> 00:28:54,164
Lost my job and my family.

711
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:57,203
- His jacket's being made.

712
00:28:57,208 --> 00:28:58,038
(chuckles)

713
00:28:58,042 --> 00:28:58,906
- Yeah.

714
00:28:58,917 --> 00:29:01,249
I'm Ben Jessup and this
is my son, Steve Jessup.

715
00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:03,490
- Where are you from?

716
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,330
- Baltimore.

717
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:05,869
We have a dental practice there.

718
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:06,705
- Really?

719
00:29:06,708 --> 00:29:07,618
You're both dentists?

720
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:08,455
- Yes.

721
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:09,948
We're black and we're dentists.

722
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:12,199
Let's not make an issue out of it.

723
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,368
- They're not making an issue.

724
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:14,865
You're making an issue.

725
00:29:16,042 --> 00:29:16,827
- [Ed] Hello.

726
00:29:17,875 --> 00:29:19,331
- Isn't this great?

727
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:21,449
- We're Ira and Barry Shalowitz.

728
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:23,414
- Ira and Barry, that's
like the ice cream.

729
00:29:23,417 --> 00:29:25,032
- No, that's us.

730
00:29:25,042 --> 00:29:27,533
- We make Ira and Barry's ice cream.

731
00:29:27,542 --> 00:29:29,078
- Really, I love that ice cream.

732
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,785
It's two...

733
00:29:32,792 --> 00:29:34,157
- Good-looking guys.

734
00:29:34,167 --> 00:29:35,748
- Models.

735
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,581
- If it was us, could you eat?

736
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:40,370
(laughing)

737
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:41,285
- Who is that?

738
00:29:47,583 --> 00:29:48,572
I'm Bonnie Rayburn.

739
00:29:51,042 --> 00:29:52,998
Actually, I was supposed
to meet somebody here,

740
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,456
but I got the message at the airport

741
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:56,699
that she's not coming and...

742
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:58,494
I'm feeling really out of place.

743
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,660
I'm thinking of leaving.

744
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:01,783
- [All] No, you should stay.

745
00:30:01,792 --> 00:30:03,703
- Right, right, right.
- Stay, definitely.

746
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:04,572
- You know, when I was alive,

747
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:06,574
I would have found her attractive.

748
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:09,450
(gun firing)

749
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:10,243
- Howdy.

750
00:30:11,167 --> 00:30:14,489
I'm Clay Stone and this
is my wife, Millie.

751
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,364
- How do?

752
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:16,205
- [Mitch and Ed] Howdy.

753
00:30:16,208 --> 00:30:17,618
- Welcome to the Stone ranch.

754
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:20,287
Believe it or not, that
work you saw a while ago,

755
00:30:20,292 --> 00:30:22,829
y'all are gonna be doing
that the next two weeks.

756
00:30:22,833 --> 00:30:23,618
- Yahoo!

757
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:27,456
- That's a good yahoo, son.

758
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:28,413
- [Ed] Thank you.

759
00:30:28,417 --> 00:30:30,453
- Now, this ranch has been in my family

760
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:33,165
for five generations,
and we've always tried

761
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:35,408
to live out here by the
code of the Old West.

762
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,453
If you came out here thinking
this is a dude ranch,

763
00:30:37,458 --> 00:30:38,868
I hate to disappoint you.

764
00:30:38,875 --> 00:30:39,864
This is not pretend.

765
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:42,957
This is a real working ranch.

766
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,331
to our ranch in Colorado.

767
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:47,322
- This is gonna be great.

768
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:49,574
- You may feel like a bunch
of pigs on roller skates

769
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:52,325
for a while, but we're
gonna be watching you.

770
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:54,073
We're gonna see how you sit a horse.

771
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,491
And in a few days, you'll
be rounding up a herd

772
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,491
and going after strays.

773
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,990
And you're gonna be in some country

774
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,740
that's just as pretty as heaven.

775
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:05,414
Now here's some of the folks
you'll be working with.

776
00:31:05,417 --> 00:31:06,907
This is T.R. and Jeff.

777
00:31:06,917 --> 00:31:08,578
They're both professional cowboys.

778
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:10,995
And our trail boss will
be in in a couple of days.

779
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,582
And this is the best
doggone Western chef going.

780
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:14,868
Cookie, hook up!

781
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:17,073
Tell them what they're gonna eat.

782
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:20,371
- You ain't gonna be getting
no nouveau, almondine,

783
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:22,912
thin crust, bottled
water, sautéed city food.

784
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:27,451
Food's brown, hot, and plenty of it.

785
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:28,994
- It's not that bad!

786
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,072
Now, listen, we're gonna
go to work in the morning.

787
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:33,789
And I mean work.

788
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:35,999
You came out here city slickers.

789
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,365
You're gonna go home cowboys.

790
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:38,785
(horse neighing)

791
00:31:38,792 --> 00:31:41,408
(country music)

792
00:31:45,042 --> 00:31:45,872
- What do you think?

793
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:47,831
- I think you look like
one of the Village People.

794
00:31:47,833 --> 00:31:51,451
(lively instrumental music)

795
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:17,990
- I'll take that shirt, too.

796
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,582
(lively instrumental music)

797
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:22,574
(groaning)

798
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:24,244
(horse neighing)

799
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,239
- [Ira] Excuse me.

800
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,080
Here, boy.

801
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:26,868
Here, boy.

802
00:32:28,167 --> 00:32:28,997
(groaning)

803
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,662
(horse neighing)

804
00:32:31,667 --> 00:32:35,285
(lively instrumental music)

805
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:43,865
- [Phil] Whoa!

806
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:47,493
(lively instrumental music)

807
00:33:00,958 --> 00:33:03,449
- [Mitch] You did it again.
Boy, you're getting great, Ed.

808
00:33:03,458 --> 00:33:04,743
- See?

809
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,536
There's nothing to it.

810
00:33:06,542 --> 00:33:07,327
Okay, your turn.

811
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:10,077
You'll do it this time.
- Okay.

812
00:33:10,083 --> 00:33:12,074
- It's wrist, wrist, wrist, go.

813
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:12,913
- Okay.

814
00:33:12,917 --> 00:33:14,908
- That's it, wrist, wrist, wrist, go.

815
00:33:14,917 --> 00:33:16,032
Will you stop kidding around?

816
00:33:16,042 --> 00:33:17,828
- I'm not kidding around.

817
00:33:17,833 --> 00:33:19,949
I can't get this, I'm not good with ropes.

818
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:21,789
I can't even take the
string off a bakery box.

819
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:22,622
(laughing)

820
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:23,660
- [Barry] This time, run!

821
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:24,452
- [Ira] Okay.

822
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:26,831
(Yalping)

823
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:28,118
(laughing)

824
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:29,240
- [Barry] Yahoo!

825
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,535
- [Ira] Hey!

826
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:32,749
- [Both] Woof!
- Everyone can do it but you.

827
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:33,660
It's embarrassing.

828
00:33:33,667 --> 00:33:35,077
- It's not a competition, Ed.

829
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:36,368
- Everything's a competition.

830
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:37,831
Life's a competition.

831
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:38,868
Come on, try it again.

832
00:33:40,042 --> 00:33:40,872
(cow mooing)

833
00:33:40,875 --> 00:33:41,739
- How's it going?

834
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,785
- Okay.

835
00:33:42,792 --> 00:33:44,123
Where have you been?

836
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:47,413
- Oh, I was watching
them castrate a horse.

837
00:33:47,417 --> 00:33:48,702
(horse neighing)

838
00:33:48,708 --> 00:33:49,823
- Well, I'm hungry.

839
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:51,118
How about you, hm?

840
00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:52,706
- [Jeff] Can I help you with that?

841
00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:55,495
- [Bonnie] No, thanks,
I think I'm getting it.

842
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,615
(cow mooing)

843
00:33:56,625 --> 00:33:57,410
- Are you?

844
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:00,698
Are you getting it?

845
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:01,538
- See this?

846
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:02,372
You see what's going on?

847
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:04,457
- Yeah, I'll take the big one.
- Wait, wait, wait a second.

848
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:05,573
We are guests here.

849
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:07,665
- What, are you gonna wrestle the cowboys?

850
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:08,998
- I'm not gonna do nothing.
- Wait, wait, wait.

851
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,991
Hey, let me handle this, okay?

852
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,830
You know how you get.

853
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:12,618
It'll be High Noon.

854
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:16,616
- [T.R.] Come on, let me help you out.

855
00:34:16,625 --> 00:34:18,866
- [Bonnie] Look, just leave me alone.

856
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:19,705
- [Mitch] Oh, damn.

857
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:20,538
- Come on.

858
00:34:20,542 --> 00:34:21,827
Well, I can't, you see.

859
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:23,369
I'm in love.

860
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:24,865
- Hi, boys, how are you?

861
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:27,240
Yeah, I was just roping over there.

862
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:29,616
Thought I'd mosey on over.

863
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:31,240
You know, I'd never moseyed before.

864
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:32,990
Hope I did it correctly.

865
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,786
I mean, I've walked, I've ambled.

866
00:34:34,792 --> 00:34:36,123
I even sashayed once.

867
00:34:36,125 --> 00:34:37,661
But that was in front of the draft board.

868
00:34:37,667 --> 00:34:39,953
(laughing)

869
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:44,864
Hello!

870
00:34:46,458 --> 00:34:49,120
(horse neighing)

871
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:50,205
Ooh, rough corral.

872
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,365
Bonnie, wanna come roping

873
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:53,285
with us?
- Yes.

874
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:54,122
- No, that's all right.

875
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:55,911
I think that Bonnie's
talking with us, friend.

876
00:34:55,917 --> 00:34:57,248
- She's fine right here.

877
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:59,161
- Guys, listen, what are you doing, huh?

878
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:00,873
This isn't exactly 90's behavior,

879
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:02,991
I gotta be honest with you.

880
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,992
(dog barking)

881
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,706
- You stepped on my foot.

882
00:35:07,708 --> 00:35:09,369
- He did not, you horse's ass.

883
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:10,285
- Ed.

884
00:35:10,292 --> 00:35:11,702
- You want a piece of this?

885
00:35:11,708 --> 00:35:12,993
- Any time, Zeke.

886
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,706
- How about right now, Stubby?

887
00:35:14,708 --> 00:35:15,663
- Fine.

888
00:35:15,667 --> 00:35:17,248
(whooshing)

889
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,831
(dramatic music)

890
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:21,040
(groaning)

891
00:35:23,292 --> 00:35:25,499
(coughing)

892
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,832
(dramatic music)

893
00:35:38,958 --> 00:35:40,949
- This man owes you an apology.

894
00:35:40,958 --> 00:35:42,744
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean anything by it.

895
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,160
- Not you.

896
00:35:44,167 --> 00:35:45,031
Him.

897
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:46,828
- Him, yeah, of course.

898
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:48,698
(dramatic music)

899
00:35:48,708 --> 00:35:50,118
- Uh-uh.

900
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:50,910
No.

901
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,830
(whooshing)

902
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:54,868
(screaming)

903
00:35:54,875 --> 00:35:57,082
God, I'm sorry, ma'am,
that'll never happen again!

904
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:58,289
(gasping)

905
00:35:58,292 --> 00:35:59,452
- Yeah, see that it doesn't.

906
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:02,655
(dramatic music)

907
00:36:02,667 --> 00:36:04,999
I'm sorry, I thought
we were on the same...

908
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,115
You're doing fine.

909
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:08,832
(dramatic music)

910
00:36:10,792 --> 00:36:11,998
- You guys were drinking.

911
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:19,161
Don't let it happen again.

912
00:36:19,167 --> 00:36:19,952
- Huh-huh.

913
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:23,832
(dramatic music)

914
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,035
- Ma'am.

915
00:36:41,042 --> 00:36:42,157
- Did you see that guy?

916
00:36:43,708 --> 00:36:46,905
That is the toughest man
I've ever seen in my life.

917
00:36:46,917 --> 00:36:49,374
(dramatic music)

918
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:50,455
(horse neighing)

919
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,994
Did you see how leathery he was?

920
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,786
He was like a saddlebag with eyes.

921
00:36:55,292 --> 00:36:58,614
- Listen, it took a lot of
courage to do what you did.

922
00:36:58,625 --> 00:36:59,410
Thank you.

923
00:37:00,458 --> 00:37:02,790
(cow mooing)

924
00:37:02,792 --> 00:37:03,656
- I'm married.

925
00:37:08,167 --> 00:37:11,659
(country music)

926
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:12,998
- [Ira] Barry, over here, Barry.

927
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,615
Barry, look here.

928
00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:16,581
- You're wrong, Ed, I'm telling you.

929
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:18,323
It was not a stupid thing to say.

930
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:19,163
- It was.

931
00:37:19,167 --> 00:37:21,658
She says, "Thanks", and
you say, "I'm married?"

932
00:37:21,667 --> 00:37:23,077
- Yeah.

933
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:26,450
I don't want any false flirtings.

934
00:37:26,458 --> 00:37:27,948
- False flirtings?
- Mm-hm.

935
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:29,914
- But what if you're like me?

936
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:31,123
What if you don't encourage them

937
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:32,956
and they still come after you?

938
00:37:32,958 --> 00:37:34,243
- It doesn't happen.

939
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,081
See, women need a reason to have sex.

940
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:37,323
Men just need a place.

941
00:37:38,958 --> 00:37:39,868
- Good night.

942
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:41,331
I'm going to bed.

943
00:37:41,333 --> 00:37:42,573
- Good night, sleep tight.

944
00:37:45,792 --> 00:37:47,623
- [Ed] That was flirting.

945
00:37:47,625 --> 00:37:48,455
- No-

946
00:37:48,458 --> 00:37:49,823
That was politeness.

947
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:51,949
That was, "Have a pleasant
and restful evening."

948
00:37:51,958 --> 00:37:53,164
- No, that was, "I like your ass.

949
00:37:53,167 --> 00:37:54,953
"Could I wear it as a hat?"

950
00:37:54,958 --> 00:37:55,868
(snorting)

951
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:56,660
- Say, hi.

952
00:37:57,833 --> 00:37:59,039
Phil was telling us you
had a little trouble

953
00:37:59,042 --> 00:38:00,077
with Jeff and T.R.?

954
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:01,823
- Yeah, they were giving
Bonnie a hard time.

955
00:38:01,833 --> 00:38:03,869
- Yeah, but he took care of it.

956
00:38:03,875 --> 00:38:06,867
- But what made it worse was
the trail boss comes over.

957
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:08,331
- Curly?

958
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:10,824
(dramatic music)

959
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:12,824
- His name is Curly?

960
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:13,993
Perfect.

961
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,830
- You know what the cook said about him?

962
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:16,573
He said he killed a man in a knife fight.

963
00:38:17,708 --> 00:38:20,245
- He said he slit him from neck to nuts.

964
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,535
- I'm not happy about this.

965
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:24,289
- This guy's a cowboy.

966
00:38:24,292 --> 00:38:26,032
One of the last real men.

967
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:28,328
He's untamed, a mustang.

968
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:29,823
We're trained ponies.

969
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:31,824
It'll do us good to be
in his world for a while.

970
00:38:31,833 --> 00:38:32,948
- Do us good?

971
00:38:32,958 --> 00:38:34,619
He was hanging the help.

972
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:36,081
- [Ed] He was helping us.

973
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:37,914
- This guy is not normal, I'm telling you.

974
00:38:37,917 --> 00:38:38,872
Did you see his eyes?

975
00:38:38,875 --> 00:38:40,411
He's got crazy eyes.

976
00:38:40,417 --> 00:38:41,247
He's a lunatic.

977
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:43,081
I'm telling you, we're
going into the wilderness

978
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:45,369
being led by a lunatic.

979
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:46,581
He's behind me, isn't he?

980
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,831
- Time to turn in.

981
00:38:51,833 --> 00:38:53,369
- [All] Good night.

982
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:58,118
- Yeah.

983
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:03,990
I'm sorry.

984
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,865
I didn't mean anything by that.

985
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:08,537
- I crap bigger than you.

986
00:39:08,542 --> 00:39:11,249
(dramatic music)

987
00:39:18,167 --> 00:39:19,828
- He's gonna kill me.

988
00:39:19,833 --> 00:39:20,663
(horse neighing)

989
00:39:20,667 --> 00:39:21,497
- Watch it!

990
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,410
Excuse me!

991
00:39:22,417 --> 00:39:23,202
Whoa!

992
00:39:25,792 --> 00:39:26,622
Whoa.

993
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:28,707
- Great, you are riding so much better.

994
00:39:28,708 --> 00:39:29,743
- Thanks.

995
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,957
Hey, I just talked to Nancy.

996
00:39:31,958 --> 00:39:32,947
- Who's Nancy?

997
00:39:32,958 --> 00:39:34,823
- She's the uh...

998
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:35,868
The girl.

999
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:37,786
- Oh, the uh...

1000
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:38,747
The girl.

1001
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,490
- She's not pregnant.

1002
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,535
- Really?

1003
00:39:41,542 --> 00:39:42,998
- Well, that's good, isn't it?

1004
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,615
- For her.

1005
00:39:45,625 --> 00:39:46,705
- So what does it mean?

1006
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:50,207
- You know what I think?

1007
00:39:50,208 --> 00:39:52,073
Out there are all the answers.

1008
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:52,868
- No, Ed.

1009
00:39:53,917 --> 00:39:54,952
Out there...

1010
00:39:57,458 --> 00:39:59,198
(groans)

1011
00:39:59,208 --> 00:40:00,914
Are cows, and plenty of them.

1012
00:40:00,917 --> 00:40:03,533
We're gonna go 200 miles
with a big, moving stink.

1013
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:06,164
Okay, ready?
- Come on.

1014
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:06,997
(horse neighing)

1015
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,082
- You guys are probably
too young to remember this,

1016
00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:10,573
but when I was a kid,

1017
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:13,325
I remember seeing a
movie called Red River.

1018
00:40:13,333 --> 00:40:14,914
- Oh, I've seen it on TV, yeah.

1019
00:40:14,917 --> 00:40:17,033
- But not in the movie theater.

1020
00:40:17,042 --> 00:40:20,239
The big screen, with John
Wayne and Montgomery Clift.

1021
00:40:21,417 --> 00:40:22,281
You remember the scene?

1022
00:40:22,292 --> 00:40:24,032
It was the start of the cattle drive.

1023
00:40:24,042 --> 00:40:25,202
- Dad.

1024
00:40:25,208 --> 00:40:26,789
- No, no, son, that's why we're here.

1025
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:28,657
- The yee-haw scene?

1026
00:40:28,667 --> 00:40:29,907
- The yee-haw scene!

1027
00:40:29,917 --> 00:40:31,782
Before they took the cattle out,

1028
00:40:31,792 --> 00:40:33,828
those cowboys waved their hats

1029
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:36,449
in the air and yelled, "Yee-haw!"

1030
00:40:38,167 --> 00:40:39,623
What do you say to that?

1031
00:40:39,625 --> 00:40:40,865
- All right!

1032
00:40:40,875 --> 00:40:42,490
Move them out!

1033
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,287
(thrilling music)

1034
00:40:46,667 --> 00:40:48,203
- Yee-haw!

1035
00:40:48,208 --> 00:40:49,414
- Yee-haw!

1036
00:40:49,417 --> 00:40:50,497
- Yahoo!

1037
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,740
- Yahoo!

1038
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,115
- Yahoo!

1039
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:53,910
- Yee-haw!

1040
00:40:55,917 --> 00:40:56,702
- Yee-haw!

1041
00:40:58,458 --> 00:40:59,698
- Yee-haw!

1042
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:00,663
- Yee-haw!

1043
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:01,531
- Yee-haw!

1044
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:02,327
- Yee-haw!

1045
00:41:04,042 --> 00:41:04,872
- Feel like a schmuck?

1046
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:06,615
- Oh, yeah, a big schmuck, yeah.

1047
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:07,990
- [Both] Yee-haw!

1048
00:41:09,542 --> 00:41:12,329
- We'll see you in Colorado!

1049
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:14,790
(all whooping)

1050
00:41:14,792 --> 00:41:17,704
(melodic music)

1051
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:21,826
J‘ Fairy tales can come true J‘

1052
00:41:21,833 --> 00:41:25,075
J‘ It can happen to you J‘

1053

00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:41,077
I If you're young at heart J‘

1056
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:46,032
J‘ And if you should survive to 105 J‘

00:41:46,458 --> 00:41:51,407
I Look at all you'll derive

1058
00:41:55,958 --> 00:41:59,621
J‘ Now here is the best part J‘

1059
00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:02,412
J‘ You have a head start J‘

I At heart J‘

1062
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:22,997
- Look, a stray.

1063
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,493
You take him, Mitch.

1064
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,331
- No, it's the first one, you get him, Ed.

1065
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:29,119
- No, no, it's the first
one. Let Phil have him.

1066
00:42:29,125 --> 00:42:30,080
- No, no, I'll get the next one.

1067
00:42:30,083 --> 00:42:31,368
Look, you get this one,
I'll get the next one.

1068
00:42:31,375 --> 00:42:33,036
- You sure? I mean,
there's gonna be plenty.

1069
00:42:33,042 --> 00:42:34,578
- No, yeah, you get this
one, I'll get the next one.

1070
00:42:34,583 --> 00:42:35,789
Then Ed, then you, we'll go--

1071
00:42:35,792 --> 00:42:37,657
- Like a round-robin kind of thing.

1072
00:42:37,667 --> 00:42:38,531
That's good, yeah.

1073
00:42:38,542 --> 00:42:39,622
All right, so who gets this?

1074
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:40,455
- [Ed and Phil] You!

1075
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:41,288
- All right, good.

1076
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:42,281
Come on, go!

1077
00:42:42,292 --> 00:42:43,498
- Out of chute number nine!

1078
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,832
- Hey, go Mitchy!
- [Ed] Let's rock, go, Mitchy!

1079
00:42:46,792 --> 00:42:49,408
- [Mitch] No, no, no, don't go back, no.

1080
00:42:50,542 --> 00:42:52,248
Think I can't see you behind there?

1081
00:42:53,667 --> 00:42:55,658
Hello.
(cow mooing)

1082
00:42:55,667 --> 00:42:58,329
Come on, now, move it, here we go.

1083
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:00,324
Come on now, here we go, come on.

1084
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:02,619
It's like chasing a mime.

1085
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:05,947
(thrilling music)

1086
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,573
(cow mooing)

1087
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:09,039
- Yee-haw, cowboy!

1088
00:43:11,042 --> 00:43:13,033
All right!
- All right, Mitchy!

1089
00:43:13,042 --> 00:43:14,782
- I did it!

1090
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:16,202
All right!

1091
00:43:16,208 --> 00:43:17,038
Oh-oh.

1092
00:43:17,042 --> 00:43:18,873
Hey, moonwalk!

1093
00:43:18,875 --> 00:43:20,411
(laughing)

1094
00:43:20,417 --> 00:43:21,953
I'd like to thank everybody and God

1095
00:43:21,958 --> 00:43:23,914
for helping me get my stray in.

1096
00:43:23,917 --> 00:43:25,327
Let's go, boy.

1097
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:26,163
Oh.

1098
00:43:26,167 --> 00:43:26,997
- All right, all right.

1099
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:27,830
Come on back.

1100
00:43:27,833 --> 00:43:28,948
Come on back, come on back.

1101
00:43:28,958 --> 00:43:30,789
All right, now, easy on the clutch.

1102
00:43:30,792 --> 00:43:31,622
Cut the wheel!

1103
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:32,831
Cut it, cut it, cut it!

1104
00:43:32,833 --> 00:43:33,663
That's it.

1105
00:43:33,667 --> 00:43:36,659
Straight back and park and lock it.

1106
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:37,782
You got the keys, sir?

1107
00:43:37,792 --> 00:43:39,032
How long you gonna be?

1108
00:43:39,042 --> 00:43:39,872
- W00!

1109
00:43:39,875 --> 00:43:41,581
I wish the kids could've seen that.

1110
00:43:42,917 --> 00:43:43,872
- Then dump it into the personal

1111
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:45,490
and then make out the check.

1112
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,161
- What are we telling him
this for? He's our accountant.

1113
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:48,828
- What are we telling you this
for? You're our accountant.

1114
00:43:48,833 --> 00:43:49,868
- No, don't...

1115
00:43:49,875 --> 00:43:50,739
Just get a Mets score.
- Okay.

1116
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:52,741
Arnold, I'm losing you.

1117
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:54,957
We're going behind a butte.

1118
00:43:54,958 --> 00:43:55,947
Arnold?

1119
00:43:55,958 --> 00:43:57,368
Arnold, what's the Mets score?

1120
00:43:57,375 --> 00:43:58,455
The Mets, huh...

1121
00:44:00,208 --> 00:44:01,789
I lost him.

1122
00:44:01,792 --> 00:44:03,999
(chuckﬁng)

1123
00:44:24,917 --> 00:44:25,872
(Bonnie mumbles)

1124
00:44:25,875 --> 00:44:27,831
- Boy, that saddle's having all the fun.

1125
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:31,249
- You have, like, a half-track mind.

1126
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:32,990
- You wouldn't like to
screw her brains out?

1127
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:33,785
- Lovely image.

1128
00:44:34,708 --> 00:44:36,869
It ranks up there with my
other favorite of yours,

1129
00:44:36,875 --> 00:44:38,786
"Bang the shit out of her."

1130
00:44:38,792 --> 00:44:40,123
(laughs)

1131
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:43,538
- I'm sorry if I offended
your delicate sensibilities.

1132
00:44:43,542 --> 00:44:45,624
I noticed you were staring
at her pretty good.

1133
00:44:45,625 --> 00:44:46,990
- That's different.

1134
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,035
- [Ed] Different?

1135
00:44:48,042 --> 00:44:49,623
- Yeah.

1136
00:44:49,625 --> 00:44:52,082
Look, I go to an art gallery, right?

1137
00:44:52,083 --> 00:44:53,198
And I see a Picasso.

1138
00:44:53,208 --> 00:44:54,618
- Oh, she's a Picasso now?

1139
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:56,707
- No, she's not a Picasso.

1140
00:44:56,708 --> 00:44:58,915
If she was a Picasso,
she'd have three tits.

1141
00:44:58,917 --> 00:45:01,624
What I'm saying is, if
I see a nice painting,

1142
00:45:03,958 --> 00:45:05,994
- Let me ask you this.

1143
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,410
What if you could have great sex

1144
00:45:07,417 --> 00:45:09,453
with someone very attractive

1145
00:45:09,458 --> 00:45:11,619
and Barbara would never find out?

1146
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:13,661
- It's a big trap. I mean,
look what happened to Phil.

1147
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:17,239
The girl came to his house,
then she came to my house.

1148
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,786
- Yeah.

1149
00:45:18,792 --> 00:45:20,202
(cows mooing)

1150
00:45:20,208 --> 00:45:22,119
Let's say a spaceship lands.

1151
00:45:22,125 --> 00:45:22,955
- Good, reality.

1152
00:45:22,958 --> 00:45:24,118
Are you listening to this?

1153
00:45:24,125 --> 00:45:26,116
- A spaceship lands and
the most beautiful woman

1154
00:45:26,125 --> 00:45:28,161
you ever saw gets out.

1155
00:45:28,167 --> 00:45:30,954
And all she wants to do
is have the greatest sex

1156
00:45:30,958 --> 00:45:32,539
in the universe with you.

1157
00:45:32,542 --> 00:45:33,372
- Could happen.

1158
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:36,617
- And the second it's over,
she flies away for eternity.

1159
00:45:36,625 --> 00:45:37,831
No one will ever know.

1160
00:45:39,083 --> 00:45:40,744
You're telling me you wouldn't do it?

1161
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:41,865
- No-

1162
00:45:41,875 --> 00:45:42,990
Because what you're describing

1163
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,536
actually happened to my cousin, Ronald.

1164
00:45:44,542 --> 00:45:46,658
And his wife did find out
about it at the beauty parlor.

1165
00:45:46,667 --> 00:45:48,248
They know everything there.

1166
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:49,080
- Forget about it.

1167
00:45:49,083 --> 00:45:51,950
- Look, Ed, what I'm saying is
it wouldn't make it all right

1168
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:52,947
if Barbara didn't know.

1169
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:55,244
I'd know, and I wouldn't like myself.

1170
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:56,285
That's all.

1171
00:45:56,292 --> 00:45:58,248
- Pay attention, girls, we got strays.

1172
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:59,080
- Hi, Curly.

1173
00:45:59,083 --> 00:45:59,993
Kill anyone today?

1174
00:46:01,042 --> 00:46:02,703
- Day ain't over yet.

1175
00:46:02,708 --> 00:46:03,948
(dramatic music)

1176
00:46:03,958 --> 00:46:04,743
- Hyah!

1177
00:46:09,792 --> 00:46:12,329
- [Mitch] I wonder what Barbara's doing.

1178
00:46:12,333 --> 00:46:14,699
- You're really with just
one woman for 15 years?

1179
00:46:14,708 --> 00:46:15,572
Just one?

1180
00:46:15,583 --> 00:46:18,120
- Yes, Ed, I'm married, I caught my limit.

1181
00:46:18,125 --> 00:46:19,706
Why are you after me about this?

1182
00:46:21,875 --> 00:46:23,240
- Let's say...

1183
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:25,081
All your life, for
breakfast, you're eating

1184
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:26,869
from the Kellogg's Variety Pack.

1185
00:46:26,875 --> 00:46:28,285
- And a spaceship lands.

1186
00:46:28,292 --> 00:46:29,532
- No-

1187
00:46:29,542 --> 00:46:31,248
And then you don't get the Variety Pack.

1188
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:33,036
You pick one, your favorite one,

1189
00:46:33,042 --> 00:46:35,158
and you just get that one from then on.

1190
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:38,409
Every day for the rest of
your life, the same cereal.

1191
00:46:38,417 --> 00:46:39,657
And then you wake up one morning

1192
00:46:39,667 --> 00:46:41,578
and you're just not hungry anymore.

1193
00:46:41,583 --> 00:46:43,448
- You can't get an erection.

1194
00:46:45,125 --> 00:46:47,616
- Hey, pal, I can get an
erection any time I want.

1195
00:46:47,625 --> 00:46:48,455
Watch.

1196
00:46:48,458 --> 00:46:49,743
- Ed, please, don't, come on.

1197
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:51,035
Leave the stallion in the corral.

1198
00:46:51,042 --> 00:46:52,578
You'll knock me into the fire, okay?

1199
00:46:52,583 --> 00:46:54,869
(chuckﬁng)

1200
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:59,330
Kim wants to have kids.

1201
00:47:00,375 --> 00:47:01,160
- And you don't?

1202
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:04,866
- I tell her it's because we
wouldn't have as much fun.

1203
00:47:04,875 --> 00:47:05,705
It would hurt her modeling.

1204
00:47:05,708 --> 00:47:07,619
But that's not the reason.

1205
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:09,741
Having a kid, that's heavy.

1206
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:11,160
That's a real commitment.

1207
00:47:11,167 --> 00:47:13,408
That's saying, "I'm never
gonna be with another woman

1208
00:47:13,417 --> 00:47:15,624
"for the rest of my life."

1209
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:18,162
- Wait a minute, let me get this straight.

1210
00:47:18,167 --> 00:47:19,498
I have no life.

1211
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,865
We're all agreed on that, right?

1212
00:47:20,875 --> 00:47:22,240
- Right.
- Yeah.

1213
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:25,572
- Okay, and your big problem
is that you're married

1214
00:47:25,583 --> 00:47:28,996
to this gorgeous
24-year-old underwear model

1215
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,447
who thinks that the sun
rises and sets in your pants,

1216
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:33,914
and that's not enough for you?

1217
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:35,248
- You don't understand.

1218
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:37,036
- No, I don't understand.

1219
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,911
- I don't wanna screw around on Kim.

1220
00:47:39,917 --> 00:47:41,282
- So don't.

1221
00:47:41,292 --> 00:47:42,077
- Oh.

1222
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,285
From the king of restraint.

1223
00:47:45,458 --> 00:47:46,288
- What does that mean?

1224
00:47:46,292 --> 00:47:49,284
- It means that's pretty
smug advice coming from a man

1225
00:47:49,292 --> 00:47:51,408
who mounted an 18-year-old checkout girl

1226
00:47:51,417 --> 00:47:52,998
on the day-old bread rack.

1227
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,615
- She's 20, and shut up.

1228
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:56,456
- Let me get you hot, Phil.

1229
00:47:56,458 --> 00:47:58,244
"I need a price, register nine.

1230
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,410
"I need a price."

1231
00:47:59,417 --> 00:48:00,497
- Cut it out.

1232
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,535
- Guys, come on--

1233
00:48:01,542 --> 00:48:03,157
- What'd you use for
protection? Paper or plastic?

1234
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:05,205
Come on!
- Come on!

1235
00:48:05,208 --> 00:48:06,493
- We're on vacation!

1236
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:07,615
- [Ed] You're gonna do nothing!

1237
00:48:07,625 --> 00:48:11,618
(splashing)
(all groan)

1238
00:48:11,625 --> 00:48:13,490
- You're spooking the cattle.

1239
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,831
- We were just fooling around.

1240
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:16,198
- See you tomorrow.

1241
00:48:16,208 --> 00:48:19,405
(playful music)

1242
00:48:19,417 --> 00:48:20,202
Sun-up.

1243
00:48:22,458 --> 00:48:25,165
(dramatic music)

1244
00:48:26,167 --> 00:48:28,499
(playful music)

1245
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:29,330
- [Steve] Morning.

1246
00:48:29,333 --> 00:48:30,994
- Hi.
- [Steve] You done with that?

1247
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,706
- Yeah, help yourself.

1248
00:48:32,708 --> 00:48:34,289
- See, Mom, we're keeping clean.

1249
00:48:35,208 --> 00:48:38,780
- It's cold, but I'm a
real pioneer man, yeah.

1250
00:48:44,708 --> 00:48:45,538
- [Mitch] Morning.

1251
00:48:45,542 --> 00:48:46,748
- Good morning.
- Morning.

1252
00:48:48,667 --> 00:48:50,032
- Come on, guys.

1253
00:48:50,042 --> 00:48:52,408
You're sorry, you're sorry.

1254
00:48:52,417 --> 00:48:53,782
Let's make up, huh?

1255
00:48:53,792 --> 00:48:56,408
(playful music)

1256
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:01,035
All right.

1257
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:04,114
- My fault.

1258
00:49:04,125 --> 00:49:05,990
- No, it's all right.

1259
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,582
- Now, to celebrate,
I got a special treat.

1260
00:49:08,583 --> 00:49:10,073
I'm gonna make fresh coffee.

1261
00:49:10,083 --> 00:49:12,415
Battery-operated, instantly
grinds its own beans.

1262
00:49:12,417 --> 00:49:14,123
Only 19.95.

1263
00:49:14,125 --> 00:49:15,490
Come on, why live like animals?

1264
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,115
- That's great.
- Yeah.

1265
00:49:17,125 --> 00:49:17,955
- All right, now first cup's gonna be

1266
00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:19,243
for my good friend Phil,

1267
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:20,490
who when we were kids used

1268
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,115
to let me watch his sister undress.

1269
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,865
- Uh.
- I've never forgot it, Phil.

1270
00:49:23,875 --> 00:49:24,830
Because I still do it.

1271
00:49:24,833 --> 00:49:26,289
(laughing)
Okay!

1272
00:49:26,292 --> 00:49:27,873
(buzzing)

1273
00:49:27,875 --> 00:49:30,332
(cows mooing)

1274
00:49:33,833 --> 00:49:35,664
Wow, there's something
spooking the cattle.

1275
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:39,369
- Look, look, look, the
cows are going away.

1276
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,661
- Wow, look at them go!

1277
00:49:45,667 --> 00:49:47,407
- That is amazing!

1278
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:48,406
- [T.R.] Stampede!

1279
00:49:48,417 --> 00:49:51,250
- [Jeff] We gotta get them!

1280
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:52,490
- [Mitch] We gotta get them.

1281
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,161
(horse neighing)
- Whoa, whoa!

1282
00:49:54,167 --> 00:49:54,997
- Beautiful.

1283
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,740
Get that in the frame.
- Oh, yeah, I got them.

1284
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:57,865
- [Ed] Hyah!

1285
00:49:57,875 --> 00:50:00,241
(soul music)

1286
00:50:06,458 --> 00:50:09,825
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1287
00:50:09,833 --> 00:50:12,666
(soul music)

1288
00:50:12,667 --> 00:50:14,077
I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die!

1289
00:50:14,083 --> 00:50:14,913
Oh, God!

1290
00:50:14,917 --> 00:50:16,123
- They're coming at us!

1291
00:50:16,125 --> 00:50:18,491
(soul music)

1292
00:50:23,083 --> 00:50:23,913
- God dammit!

1293
00:50:23,917 --> 00:50:26,499
(horse neighing)

1294
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,410
Come on!

1295
00:50:27,417 --> 00:50:29,783
- Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!

1296
00:50:29,792 --> 00:50:32,158
(soul music)

1297
00:50:40,125 --> 00:50:42,411
- Bonnie, there's a stampede!

1298
00:50:42,417 --> 00:50:43,577
In your tent!

1299
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,949
(soul music)

1300
00:50:58,208 --> 00:50:59,448
(screaming)

1301
00:50:59,458 --> 00:51:01,870
(soul music)

1302
00:51:23,833 --> 00:51:26,119
(screaming)

1303
00:51:28,042 --> 00:51:30,408
(soul music)

1304
00:51:39,792 --> 00:51:42,158
(gun firing)

1305
00:51:48,042 --> 00:51:48,827
- City folk.

1306
00:51:49,958 --> 00:51:52,165
(chuckles)

1307
00:51:57,917 --> 00:51:58,997
- I'm sorry.

1308
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,072
I mean, I was just trying
to make a cup of coffee.

1309
00:52:02,083 --> 00:52:02,868
That's all.

1310
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:07,913
It was French roast.

1311
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,328
- There's still a few head missing.

1312
00:52:10,333 --> 00:52:11,448
Must have gone into that canyon

1313
00:52:11,458 --> 00:52:12,743
while I was getting the others.

1314
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:13,705
- [Jeff] T.R. and I'll get them.

1315
00:52:13,708 --> 00:52:14,743
- No, I'll get them.

1316
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,161
With you.

1317
00:52:18,167 --> 00:52:19,577
(dramatic music)

1318
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:20,413
- Me?

1319
00:52:20,417 --> 00:52:21,953
- Yeah.

1320
00:52:21,958 --> 00:52:23,494
You're coming with me.

1321
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:24,489
- Just the two of us?

1322
00:52:27,417 --> 00:52:30,534
- [Curly] You move the
herd, I'll catch up.

1323
00:52:30,542 --> 00:52:32,533
- You mean, we'll catch up.

1324
00:52:32,542 --> 00:52:33,531
- Let's go.

1325
00:52:33,542 --> 00:52:36,249
(dramatic music)

1326
00:52:45,542 --> 00:52:46,327
- Bye.

1327
00:52:49,292 --> 00:52:52,284
Curly, did I ever show you
pictures of my wife and kids?

1328
00:52:53,833 --> 00:52:55,448
I'm their sole support, you know.

1329
00:52:55,458 --> 00:52:57,198
- Is he gonna be all right?

1330
00:52:57,208 --> 00:52:58,573
- Sure.

1331
00:52:58,583 --> 00:53:00,949
Curly's just trying to scare
him. You know Mitch, he's a...

1332
00:53:00,958 --> 00:53:01,868
He's a wise-ass.

1333
00:53:03,667 --> 00:53:05,453
- If anything happens to him...

1334
00:53:05,458 --> 00:53:06,538
(panting)

1335
00:53:06,542 --> 00:53:07,873
I'm going after Barbara.

1336
00:53:12,292 --> 00:53:14,999
(birds chirping)

1337
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,992
- Throw a rope on this one so
we can go after the others.

1338
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,661
Rope him.
- I'm not good at it.

1339
00:53:20,667 --> 00:53:21,952
I have a roping disability.

1340
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:26,366
(playful music)

1341
00:53:35,792 --> 00:53:36,656
Be right with you.

1342
00:53:37,625 --> 00:53:39,161
(cow mooing)

1343
00:53:39,167 --> 00:53:41,783
(playful music)

1344
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:45,956
- Jesus Christ.

1345
00:53:45,958 --> 00:53:48,574
(playful music)

1346
00:53:49,958 --> 00:53:50,788
- Hey.

1347
00:53:50,792 --> 00:53:52,077
See, I'm good at this part.

1348
00:53:53,292 --> 00:53:54,452
- Throw it.

1349
00:53:54,458 --> 00:53:57,074
(playful music)

1350
00:54:05,292 --> 00:54:06,873
- You know what just occurred to me?

1351
00:54:06,875 --> 00:54:08,081
Roping is stupid.

1352
00:54:08,083 --> 00:54:10,074
This is a cow, not a gazelle.

1353
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:10,913
Watch.

1354
00:54:10,917 --> 00:54:12,657
Get off the horse, huh?

1355
00:54:12,667 --> 00:54:13,452
Okay.

1356
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:17,706
Then you walk up to the cow.

1357
00:54:17,708 --> 00:54:19,448
Look how good this is working.

1358
00:54:19,458 --> 00:54:22,700
Then you say, "Hi, Bob
Vila for This Old Herd.

1359
00:54:22,708 --> 00:54:24,073
"We're gonna rope you today."

1360
00:54:24,083 --> 00:54:26,415
Then you take Mr. Loop

1361
00:54:26,417 --> 00:54:28,703
and put it around the head of Mr. Cow.

1362
00:54:33,375 --> 00:54:35,240
Now what's wrong with that?

1363
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:36,080
(whistles)

1364
00:54:36,083 --> 00:54:36,913
Ah!

1365
00:54:36,917 --> 00:54:40,080
(cow mooing)

1366
00:54:40,083 --> 00:54:41,038
- That!

1367
00:54:41,042 --> 00:54:43,249
- I'm on vacation!

1368
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:44,740
(screaming)

1369
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:47,947
(lively country music)

1370
00:54:50,875 --> 00:54:53,491
(cow mooing)

1371
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,115
Is that it?

1372
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,080
- That's it.

1373
00:54:59,125 --> 00:55:00,535
- [Mitch] What are we doing?

1374
00:55:00,542 --> 00:55:01,327
- Making camp.

1375
00:55:02,708 --> 00:55:05,575
Too late to catch up to
the herd before dark.

1376
00:55:05,583 --> 00:55:07,414
We'll catch up tomorrow.

1377
00:55:07,417 --> 00:55:08,748
- You mean we're gonna...

1378
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:10,490
Sleep out here?

1379
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,286
Just uh...

1380
00:55:12,292 --> 00:55:13,077
- That's right.

1381
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,662
(chuckles)

1382
00:55:17,667 --> 00:55:19,703
- Oh, God, it's deliverance.

1383
00:55:19,708 --> 00:55:22,415
(dramatic music)

1384
00:55:29,542 --> 00:55:30,622
Getting ready to shave?

1385
00:55:31,875 --> 00:55:32,910
- You make a lot of...

1386
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,536
Smart remarks at my expense, don't you?

1387
00:55:38,167 --> 00:55:39,828
- I'm joking.

1388
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:40,913
I do it with everybody.

1389
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:43,080
It's just my way.

1390
00:55:44,792 --> 00:55:46,373
- I don't understand that way.

1391
00:55:51,208 --> 00:55:54,120
(harmonica music)

1392
00:55:54,125 --> 00:55:55,240
Put that away.

1393
00:55:59,583 --> 00:56:01,448
(harmonica music)

1394
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:02,243
I said...

1395
00:56:04,208 --> 00:56:05,323
Put that away.

1396
00:56:07,333 --> 00:56:08,413
- Hey, you know, the first time I tried

1397
00:56:08,417 --> 00:56:10,123
to talk to you, you embarrassed me.

1398
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:12,490
So I teased you a little bit,

1399
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,240
which maybe I shouldn't have done.

1400
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:15,706
So I'm sorry.

1401
00:56:15,708 --> 00:56:16,823
And now you're sitting over there playing

1402
00:56:16,833 --> 00:56:18,915
with your knife, trying to frighten me,

1403
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,453
which you're doing a good job.

1404
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,582
But if you're gonna
kill me, get on with it.

1405
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:27,869
If not, shut the hell up!

1406
00:56:29,667 --> 00:56:31,407
I'm on vacation.

1407
00:56:31,417 --> 00:56:33,658
(clanging)

1408
00:56:33,667 --> 00:56:36,374
(fire crackling)

1409
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,787
(harmonica music)

1410
00:56:56,792 --> 00:56:58,282
(cow mooing)

1411
00:56:58,292 --> 00:57:02,615
J‘ See them tumbling down I

1412
00:57:02,625 --> 00:57:06,163
J‘ Pledging their love to the ground J‘

1413
00:57:06,167 --> 00:57:09,580
J‘ Lonely, but free, I'll be found J‘

1414
00:57:09,583 --> 00:57:11,414
J‘ Drifting along J‘

1415
00:57:11,417 --> 00:57:16,366
J‘ With the tumbling tumbleweeds J‘

1416
00:57:16,375 --> 00:57:20,493
J‘ Cares of the past are behind I

1417
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:25,449
J‘ Nowhere to go but I'll find J‘

1418
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:30,702
J‘ Just where the trail will wind I

1419
00:57:30,708 --> 00:57:35,657
J‘ Drifting along with the
tumbling tumbleweeds J‘

1420
00:57:36,208 --> 00:57:38,324
(panting)

1421
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:44,160
- [Mitch] Do you know any show tunes?

1422
00:57:45,625 --> 00:57:47,411
And the second it's over,

1423
00:57:47,417 --> 00:57:49,157
she's gonna get back into her spaceship

1424
00:57:49,167 --> 00:57:51,249
and fly away for eternity.

1425
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:52,035
Would you do it?

1426
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,115
- [Curly] Is she a redhead?

1427
00:57:55,208 --> 00:57:56,072
- [Mitch] Could be.

1428
00:57:57,792 --> 00:57:58,872
- I like redheads.

1429
00:58:04,292 --> 00:58:06,203
- You ever been married?

1430
00:58:06,208 --> 00:58:06,993
- No-

1431
00:58:09,042 --> 00:58:10,157
- You ever been in love?

1432
00:58:11,625 --> 00:58:13,035
(panting)

1433
00:58:13,042 --> 00:58:13,827
- Once.

1434
00:58:15,542 --> 00:58:18,249
I was driving a herd across the Panhandle.

1435
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:19,365
Texas.
- Mm-hm.

1436
00:58:20,458 --> 00:58:23,325
- And passed near this little dirt farm

1437
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,322
around about sundown.

1438
00:58:26,458 --> 00:58:29,780
Out in the field was this young woman,

1439
00:58:29,792 --> 00:58:31,248
working down in the dirt.

1440
00:58:32,583 --> 00:58:35,495
Just about then, she stood
up to stretch her back.

1441
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,616
(panting)

1442
00:58:38,625 --> 00:58:40,581
She was wearing a little cotton dress,

1443
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:43,655
and the setting sun was right behind her,

1444
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,956
showing the shape that God had give her.

1445
00:58:49,208 --> 00:58:51,164
- What happened?
(horse neighing)

1446
00:58:51,167 --> 00:58:51,997
(chuckﬁng)

1447
00:58:55,375 --> 00:58:56,160
- Why?

1448
00:58:58,250 --> 00:59:00,582
- I figured it wasn't gonna
get any better than that.

1449
00:59:01,792 --> 00:59:04,374
- Yeah, but you could've
been, you know, with her.

1450
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:07,408
- I've been with lots of women.

1451
00:59:07,417 --> 00:59:09,328
- Yeah, but, you know,
she could've been the love

1452
00:59:09,333 --> 00:59:10,163
of your life.

1453
00:59:11,208 --> 00:59:11,993
- She is.

1454
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:15,247
- That's great.

1455
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:16,035
That's...

1456
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:17,830
Not great.

1457
00:59:17,833 --> 00:59:19,073
No, that's wrong, Curly.

1458
00:59:19,083 --> 00:59:21,825
You passed up something that
might have been terrific.

1459
00:59:21,833 --> 00:59:23,198
- My choice.

1460
00:59:23,208 --> 00:59:25,119
- I never could have done that.

1461
00:59:25,125 --> 00:59:26,160
- That's your choice.

1462
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:31,162
A cowboy leads a different kind of life...

1463
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:32,373
When there were cowboys.

1464
00:59:34,167 --> 00:59:35,122
We're a dying breed.

1465
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:41,415
Still means something to me, though.

1466
00:59:41,417 --> 00:59:44,955
In a couple of days, we'll move
this herd across the river,

1467
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,206
drive them through the valley.

1468
00:59:49,208 --> 00:59:50,368
Oh!

1469
00:59:50,375 --> 00:59:51,740
(chuckles)

1470
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:54,492
There's nothing like bringing in a herd.

1471
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,036
- See, now that's great.

1472
00:59:56,042 --> 00:59:57,657
Your life makes sense to you.

1473
00:59:57,667 --> 00:59:59,157
(laughing)

1474
00:59:59,167 --> 01:00:00,031
What?

1475
01:00:00,042 --> 01:00:00,997
What's so funny?

1476
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,413
- You city folk, you worry
about a lot of shit, don't you?

1477
01:00:04,417 --> 01:00:05,327
- Shit?
- Yeah.

1478
01:00:05,333 --> 01:00:08,575
- My wife basically told me
she doesn't want me around.

1479
01:00:08,583 --> 01:00:10,039
- Is she a redhead?

1480
01:00:10,042 --> 01:00:10,872
(laughing)

1481
01:00:10,875 --> 01:00:13,457
- I'm just saying--
- How old are you?

1482
01:00:13,458 --> 01:00:14,447
38?

1483
01:00:14,458 --> 01:00:15,288
- 39.

1484
01:00:15,292 --> 01:00:16,122
- Yeah.

1485
01:00:16,125 --> 01:00:17,615
You all come up here about the same age.

1486
01:00:17,625 --> 01:00:19,161
Same problems.

1487
01:00:19,167 --> 01:00:21,078
Spend about 50 weeks a year getting knots

1488
01:00:21,083 --> 01:00:22,744
in your rope and then...

1489
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:26,743
Then you think two weeks up
here'll untie them for you.

1490
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:28,286
None of you get it.

1491
01:00:31,375 --> 01:00:33,491
Do you know what the secret of life is?

1492
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:34,330
- No-

1493
01:00:34,333 --> 01:00:35,118
What?

1494
01:00:36,042 --> 01:00:37,248
- This.

1495
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:38,615
- Your finger?

1496
01:00:38,625 --> 01:00:39,910
- One thing.

1497
01:00:39,917 --> 01:00:41,123
Just one thing.

1498
01:00:42,875 --> 01:00:46,788
You stick to that and
everything else don't mean shit.

1499
01:00:46,792 --> 01:00:48,623
- That's great, but...

1500
01:00:48,625 --> 01:00:49,660
What's the one thing?

1501
01:00:51,083 --> 01:00:52,869
- That's what you gotta figure out.

1502
01:00:52,875 --> 01:00:55,582
(dramatic music)

1503
01:00:58,208 --> 01:01:00,574
(cow mooing)

1504
01:01:01,458 --> 01:01:03,198
Oh, damn it, come on!

1505
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:08,616
(cow mooing)

1506
01:01:11,208 --> 01:01:12,038
- [Mitch] What's the matter?

1507
01:01:12,042 --> 01:01:13,282
What's going on?

1508
01:01:13,292 --> 01:01:15,328
- This cow's having a baby, yeah.

1509
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,411
(cow mooing)

1510
01:01:18,417 --> 01:01:20,248
I noticed it when we found her.

1511
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:21,786
I was hoping she'd make
it through the drive,

1512
01:01:21,792 --> 01:01:24,124
but she's ready.

1513
01:01:24,125 --> 01:01:26,662
- Does she do it herself
or do you have to help her?

1514
01:01:26,667 --> 01:01:27,497
- I'll hold her down.

1515
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,536
You deliver the calf.

1516
01:01:29,542 --> 01:01:30,873
- Excuse me?

1517
01:01:30,875 --> 01:01:31,705
Hello!

1518
01:01:31,708 --> 01:01:32,663
Why don't I hold her down?

1519
01:01:32,667 --> 01:01:34,532
- Because you don't know how.

1520
01:01:34,542 --> 01:01:37,124
She'll kick you and kill
you, and her and the calf.

1521
01:01:37,125 --> 01:01:39,411
And that's too much for me to carry back.

1522
01:01:39,417 --> 01:01:40,827
- I see your point.

1523
01:01:40,833 --> 01:01:41,948
- Come on, she's ready.

1524
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:45,497
- I...

1525
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:46,706
- She's bursting!

1526
01:01:46,708 --> 01:01:48,494
- Oh, God, there's gonna be bursting?

1527
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:52,412
- Just reach in and pull out the calf.

1528
01:01:59,208 --> 01:02:01,574
(cow mooing)

1529
01:02:06,833 --> 01:02:07,618
- Ooh.

1530
01:02:11,583 --> 01:02:13,995
(groaning)

1531
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,285
You know, this was not in the brochure.

1532
01:02:15,292 --> 01:02:17,123
- She needs help, goddamn it!

1533
01:02:21,167 --> 01:02:22,907
(groaning)

1534
01:02:22,917 --> 01:02:23,747
Now what's taking so long?

1535
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:24,705
Do you see the head?

1536
01:02:29,208 --> 01:02:31,415
(coughing)

1537
01:02:33,417 --> 01:02:34,907
- I only see a tail.

1538
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,077
- Oh, shit!

1539
01:02:36,083 --> 01:02:37,948
It's turned the wrong way.

1540
01:02:37,958 --> 01:02:38,743
Get it out.

1541
01:02:40,625 --> 01:02:41,956
- Uh-oh.

1542
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:42,822
My watch came off.

1543
01:02:42,833 --> 01:02:44,164
- Now!

1544
01:02:44,167 --> 01:02:45,498
- It was a gift!

1545
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,706
- Do it!

1546
01:02:46,708 --> 01:02:47,743
(cow mooing)

1547
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:48,910
(groaning)

1548
01:02:48,917 --> 01:02:49,827
- Come on.

1549
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:52,324
(groaning)

1550
01:02:52,333 --> 01:02:53,118
Come on.

1551
01:02:54,167 --> 01:02:56,374
(groaning)

1552
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,285
(chuckﬁng)

1553
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,081
- Look what I did!

1554
01:03:12,083 --> 01:03:13,163
I made a cow.

1555
01:03:16,833 --> 01:03:17,822
This is unbelievable.

1556
01:03:20,083 --> 01:03:21,289
This is amazing.

1557
01:03:21,292 --> 01:03:22,702
- He looks like you.

1558
01:03:22,708 --> 01:03:23,538
(laughs)

1559
01:03:23,542 --> 01:03:25,123
- Look at him.

1560
01:03:25,125 --> 01:03:26,410
Yeah.

1561
01:03:26,417 --> 01:03:27,281
Get up.

1562
01:03:27,292 --> 01:03:28,873
(cow mooing)

1563
01:03:28,875 --> 01:03:29,739
- Oh, shit.

1564
01:03:31,167 --> 01:03:32,498
- Look, look at this.

1565
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,036
He's walking already.

1566
01:03:34,042 --> 01:03:35,031
He's a genius.

1567
01:03:36,042 --> 01:03:37,828
He gets that from my side of the family.

1568
01:03:37,833 --> 01:03:39,164
We all walked very early.

1569
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,082
I'm gonna name him Norman.

1570
01:03:44,083 --> 01:03:45,573
You know, because years ago...

1571
01:03:45,583 --> 01:03:46,789
(gun firing)

1572
01:03:46,792 --> 01:03:48,908
(horse neighing)

1573
01:03:48,917 --> 01:03:50,327
(dramatic music)

1574
01:03:50,333 --> 01:03:51,698
Why did you do that?

1575
01:03:51,708 --> 01:03:52,493
- She was dying.

1576
01:03:55,708 --> 01:03:56,788
And she was suffering.

1577
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:00,160
You saved the calf.

1578
01:04:05,917 --> 01:04:07,282
Good job, cowboy.

1579
01:04:07,292 --> 01:04:09,999
(dramatic music)

1580
01:04:21,875 --> 01:04:22,910
- [Mitch] There you
go, Norman, that is it.

1581
01:04:22,917 --> 01:04:24,453
You are only down a quart.

1582
01:04:24,458 --> 01:04:25,538
- That's really wonderful.

1583
01:04:25,542 --> 01:04:27,373
You got him to drink from the bottle.

1584
01:04:29,208 --> 01:04:32,075
- Yeah, thank God, because
my nipples were killing me.

1585
01:04:32,083 --> 01:04:34,369
(laughing)

1586
01:04:34,375 --> 01:04:35,285
- What do you think?

1587
01:04:35,292 --> 01:04:38,250
What would be the perfect
flavor with this meal?

1588
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:39,706
- Cherry vanilla?

1589
01:04:39,708 --> 01:04:40,538
- No-

1590
01:04:40,542 --> 01:04:42,328
If it was Chinese food,
right on the money.

1591
01:04:42,333 --> 01:04:43,163
But this?

1592
01:04:43,167 --> 01:04:44,156
Toasted almond.

1593
01:04:45,958 --> 01:04:47,949
(cow mooing)

1594
01:04:47,958 --> 01:04:49,073
- What's going on?

1595
01:04:49,083 --> 01:04:51,039
- Barry can pick out
the exact right flavor

1596
01:04:51,042 --> 01:04:53,408
of ice cream to follow any meal.

1597
01:04:53,417 --> 01:04:54,953
(laughing)

1598
01:04:54,958 --> 01:04:56,243
Go ahead.

1599
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:57,035
Challenge him.

1600
01:04:58,542 --> 01:04:59,372
- Challenge him?

1601
01:04:59,375 --> 01:05:00,160
- [Ira] Come on.

1602
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,365
- Franks and beans.

1603
01:05:04,375 --> 01:05:06,411
- Scoop of chocolate, scoop of vanilla.

1604
01:05:06,417 --> 01:05:07,907
Don't waste my time.

1605
01:05:09,292 --> 01:05:11,999
(dramatic music)

1606
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:17,535
Come on.

1607
01:05:18,833 --> 01:05:19,618
Push me.

1608
01:05:24,333 --> 01:05:25,789
- Sea bass.

1609
01:05:25,792 --> 01:05:26,577
- Grilled?

1610
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:28,865
- Sautéed.

1611
01:05:28,875 --> 01:05:29,660
- I'm with you.

1612
01:05:30,667 --> 01:05:31,782
- Potatoes au gratin.

1613
01:05:33,208 --> 01:05:36,325
(dramatic music)

1614
01:05:36,333 --> 01:05:37,539
Asparagus.

1615
01:05:37,542 --> 01:05:40,249
(dramatic music)

1616
01:05:45,167 --> 01:05:46,031
- Rum raisin.

1617
01:05:49,917 --> 01:05:50,906
- [Both] Woof!

1618
01:05:50,917 --> 01:05:52,498
- Woof, what?

1619
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:53,956
How do you know he's right?

1620
01:05:53,958 --> 01:05:55,573
- How do we know?

1621
01:05:55,583 --> 01:05:57,949
1,400 retail outlets across the country.

1622
01:05:57,958 --> 01:05:59,073
That's how we know.

1623
01:06:01,167 --> 01:06:02,077
- [Both] Woof!

1624
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:04,495
- Will you stop with Roberto Clemente?

1625
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,616
Henry Aaron was the greatest right fielder

1626
01:06:06,625 --> 01:06:07,740
of our generation.

1627
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:08,830
- Could he run like Clemente?

1628
01:06:08,833 --> 01:06:09,663
Could he throw like Clemente?

1629
01:06:09,667 --> 01:06:13,740
- Look, I'm gonna say one thing
to you, okay? 755 home runs.

1630
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:14,614
Good bye.

1631
01:06:14,625 --> 01:06:16,616
- Hey, Clemente was
killed in a plane crash.

1632
01:06:16,625 --> 01:06:18,240
- What, you're gonna blame that on Aaron?

1633
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:19,740
- No, I'm not blaming, I'm just saying.

1634
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:21,832
- Ugh, baseball.

1635
01:06:21,833 --> 01:06:22,663
(cow mooing)

1636
01:06:22,667 --> 01:06:23,998
- You've got something against baseball?

1637
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:24,830
- It's just I used to live with a guy

1638
01:06:24,833 --> 01:06:28,746
who was like a baseball
encyclopedia and I just got flashes.

1639
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:30,490
- You broke up with him
because of baseball?

1640
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:31,660
- Uh, no.

1641
01:06:31,667 --> 01:06:33,203
We had different needs.

1642
01:06:33,208 --> 01:06:35,244
I needed him to treat me
decently and get a job

1643
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:38,287
and he needed to empty my
bank account and leave.

1644
01:06:38,292 --> 01:06:39,077
- Ouch!

1645
01:06:40,625 --> 01:06:42,411
- So, do you hate baseball?

1646
01:06:42,417 --> 01:06:44,248
- No, I like baseball.

1647
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:45,740
I just never understood how you guys

1648
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:48,241
can spend so much time discussing it.

1649
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:50,491
I mean, I've been to
games, but I don't memorize

1650
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:54,448
who played third base
for Pittsburgh in 1960.

1651
01:06:54,458 --> 01:06:55,743
- [All] Don Hoak.

1652
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:56,990
- Beat you.

1653
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,332
- See, that's exactly what I mean.

1654
01:06:59,333 --> 01:07:03,747
- So, what do you and your
friends talk about out there?

1655
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:07,072
- Well, real life.

1656
01:07:07,083 --> 01:07:08,414
Relationships.

1657
01:07:08,417 --> 01:07:09,247
Are they working?

1658
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:10,581
Are they not?

1659
01:07:10,583 --> 01:07:11,413
Who's she seeing?

1660
01:07:11,417 --> 01:07:13,032
Is that working?

1661
01:07:13,042 --> 01:07:14,077
- No contest, we win.

1662
01:07:15,125 --> 01:07:16,410
- [Bonnie] Why?

1663
01:07:16,417 --> 01:07:20,740
- Honey, if that were as
interesting as baseball,

1664
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:23,457
they'd have cards for
it and sell it with gum.

1665
01:07:23,458 --> 01:07:25,665
(cow mooing)

1666
01:07:25,667 --> 01:07:28,625
- Ed, I see by the sun it's
time for you to hibernate again.

1667
01:07:29,875 --> 01:07:31,035
- You're right, I suppose.

1668
01:07:31,042 --> 01:07:33,624
I mean, I guess it is childish, but uh...

1669
01:07:34,958 --> 01:07:37,745
When I was about 18 and my
dad and I couldn't communicate

1670
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:42,494
about anything at all, we could
still talk about baseball.

1671
01:07:44,292 --> 01:07:45,407
You know, that was real.

1672
01:07:47,417 --> 01:07:49,783
(cow mooing)

1673
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,866
- You know what the secret of life is?

1674
01:07:53,875 --> 01:07:55,240
It's this.

1675
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:57,241
(cow mooing)

1676
01:07:57,250 --> 01:07:58,581
One thing.

1677
01:07:58,583 --> 01:07:59,572
Just one thing.

1678
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:01,785
- And what's that?

1679
01:08:01,792 --> 01:08:03,032
- I have no idea.

1680
01:08:03,042 --> 01:08:04,248
(chuckﬁng)

1681
01:08:06,917 --> 01:08:08,782
- Curly knows the secret of life?

1682
01:08:08,792 --> 01:08:10,077
- Yeah.

1683
01:08:10,083 --> 01:08:11,448
I'm gonna invite him over.

1684
01:08:11,458 --> 01:08:12,914
I mean, he's a very
interesting guy, you'll see.

1685
01:08:12,917 --> 01:08:13,781
- I'm sure he is.

1686
01:08:21,333 --> 01:08:23,995
- Hey, Curly.

1687
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,456
Curly?

1688
01:08:25,458 --> 01:08:26,288
Curl?

1689
01:08:26,292 --> 01:08:27,077
You got a minute?

1690
01:08:28,917 --> 01:08:30,498
He is a real cowboy.

1691
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:33,867
He sleeps with his eyes open
so he can still watch the herd.

1692
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,115
Curl.

1693
01:08:39,125 --> 01:08:40,365
(soft piano music)
Curly?

1694
01:08:55,083 --> 01:08:56,414
- Is this all right?

1695
01:08:56,417 --> 01:08:59,864
Do you need, like, a license
or something to bury somebody?

1696
01:08:59,875 --> 01:09:00,705
- No-

1697
01:09:00,708 --> 01:09:02,323
This is where Curly would wanna be buried.

1698
01:09:02,333 --> 01:09:04,244
- I mean, he said he was a dying breed.

1699
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:06,286
I didn't know he meant on this trip.

1700
01:09:06,292 --> 01:09:08,499
- The man ate bacon at every meal.

1701
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:10,582
I mean, you can't do that.

1702
01:09:10,583 --> 01:09:12,995
- [Steve] Well, I guess that's it.

1703
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,991
- [Ira] Wait a minute, shouldn't
somebody say something?

1704
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,240
I mean, you know, like a eulogy.

1705
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:17,535
- [All] Yeah.

1706
01:09:17,542 --> 01:09:19,658
- [Mitch] Cookie, you knew him best.

1707
01:09:25,083 --> 01:09:27,415
- Lord, we give you Curly.

1708
01:09:27,417 --> 01:09:28,748
Try not to piss him off.

1709
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:31,865
- That's it?

1710
01:09:31,875 --> 01:09:32,705
- What else is there?

1711
01:09:32,708 --> 01:09:34,448
I got chicken burning.

1712
01:09:34,458 --> 01:09:36,414
- You're a warm man, Cookie.

1713
01:09:36,417 --> 01:09:37,452
Wait a second, I'll...

1714
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:41,990
(sighs)

1715
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,285
What can I say about Curly?

1716
01:09:44,375 --> 01:09:46,832
I didn't know you well,
but I'll never forget you.

1717
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:51,868
You lived life on your terms:
simple, honest and brave.

1718
01:09:53,042 --> 01:09:56,205
I'm glad for this short
time that we spent together.

1719
01:09:56,208 --> 01:09:57,038
- Amen.

1720
01:09:57,042 --> 01:09:57,872
- Amen.
- Amen.

1721
01:09:57,875 --> 01:09:59,285
- Amen.
- Amen.

1722
01:09:59,292 --> 01:10:01,999
(dramatic music)

1723
01:10:07,083 --> 01:10:08,448
Do you think this is all right?

1724
01:10:08,458 --> 01:10:09,538
I mean, with them.

1725
01:10:09,542 --> 01:10:11,453
- All right, listen up.

1726
01:10:11,458 --> 01:10:14,245
Ben, I want you to take the
left flank with T.R. and Bonnie.

1727
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:16,616
I want you three boys,
you're gonna ride point.

1728
01:10:16,625 --> 01:10:19,287
I'm gonna push with Steve, Barry and Ira.

1729
01:10:19,292 --> 01:10:21,203
- Yeah, they're pros.

1730
01:10:21,208 --> 01:10:22,744
It'll be okay.

1731
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:24,957
(dramatic music)

1732
01:10:24,958 --> 01:10:29,907
- H
(ho yah!
rse neighing)

1733
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:35,457
(dramatic music)

1734
01:10:46,667 --> 01:10:47,622
- So long, cowboy.

1735
01:10:49,167 --> 01:10:51,874
(dramatic music)

1736
01:10:55,917 --> 01:10:58,374
(bird cawing)

1737
01:11:04,208 --> 01:11:06,415
(cows mooing)

1738
01:11:06,417 --> 01:11:08,248
You know, it makes you stop and think.

1739
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:09,911
- Stop the clock.

1740
01:11:09,917 --> 01:11:12,158
- That's 25 minutes, I win.
- Yup.

1741
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:13,407
- Win what?

1742
01:11:13,417 --> 01:11:15,783
- I had under a half an
hour before you started

1743
01:11:15,792 --> 01:11:17,532
to talk about death.

1744
01:11:17,542 --> 01:11:19,828
- Why would you think I
would talk about death?

1745
01:11:19,833 --> 01:11:20,663
- What, are you kidding?

1746
01:11:20,667 --> 01:11:22,032
We just came from a funeral.

1747
01:11:22,042 --> 01:11:23,578
And it's your favorite subject.

1748
01:11:23,583 --> 01:11:24,413
- It is not.

1749
01:11:24,417 --> 01:11:25,998
I just think that when you see a life end,

1750
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,912
it's a natural time to think
about your own mortality.

1751
01:11:28,917 --> 01:11:30,373
- No, it isn't.

1752
01:11:30,375 --> 01:11:32,115
Why do that to yourself?

1753
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:34,662
When somebody dies, I don't
change places with him.

1754
01:11:34,667 --> 01:11:37,204
I appreciate the fact that I'm not dead.

1755
01:11:37,208 --> 01:11:39,324
Look at this: it's a beautiful day,

1756
01:11:39,333 --> 01:11:40,869
I'm here with my two best friends

1757
01:11:40,875 --> 01:11:43,537
and we're driving a herd of
cattle across the plains.

1758
01:11:43,542 --> 01:11:44,748
Pretty goddamn great.

1759
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:47,116
It's one of the best days of my life.

1760
01:11:47,125 --> 01:11:50,242
- All right, what is the
best day of your life?

1761
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:51,239
- You mean ever?

1762
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:53,866
- Yeah, best day ever in your whole life.

1763
01:11:53,875 --> 01:11:56,036
And you can't do when your kids
were born. That's too easy.

1764
01:11:57,875 --> 01:11:58,660
- I got one.

1765
01:12:00,125 --> 01:12:03,288
I'm seven years old and my dad
takes me to Yankee Stadium.

1766
01:12:03,292 --> 01:12:04,077
My first game.

1767
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:08,663
We're going in this long, dark
tunnel underneath the stands

1768
01:12:08,667 --> 01:12:10,623
and I'm holding his
hand and we come up out

1769
01:12:10,625 --> 01:12:12,536
of the tunnel into the light.

1770
01:12:14,167 --> 01:12:15,077
It was huge.

1771
01:12:15,083 --> 01:12:17,699
How green the grass was.

1772
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:18,538
Brown dirt.

1773
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:21,582
And that great green
copper roof, remember?

1774
01:12:22,542 --> 01:12:23,702
We had a black-and-white TV,

1775
01:12:23,708 --> 01:12:25,994
so this was the first
game I ever saw in color.

1776
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:29,832
I sat there the whole game next to my dad.

1777
01:12:29,833 --> 01:12:31,323
He taught me how to keep score.

1778
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:33,410
Mickey hit one out.

1779
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:36,373
- Good day.

1780
01:12:36,375 --> 01:12:37,865
- And I still have the program.

1781
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:42,116
- All right, what was the
worst day you ever had?

1782
01:12:44,708 --> 01:12:46,289
- Worst day?

1783
01:12:46,292 --> 01:12:48,499
A couple of years ago,
Barbara finds a lump.

1784
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:49,330
- [Phil] What?

1785
01:12:49,333 --> 01:12:50,368
- Jesus.

1786
01:12:50,375 --> 01:12:51,911
- Yeah, it scared the shit out of me.

1787
01:12:51,917 --> 01:12:53,532
- You never said anything.

1788
01:12:53,542 --> 01:12:55,157
- Yeah, well, you know, it
turned out to be nothing.

1789
01:12:55,167 --> 01:12:57,078
But that whole day was...

1790
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:00,748
- Yeah, but that was a good day.

1791
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:01,739
- How?

1792
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:03,456
- Because it turned out to be nothing.

1793
01:13:03,458 --> 01:13:06,746
- Yeah, but the whole day
until then was horrible.

1794
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:08,991
- Yeah, but it came out good.

1795
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,787
You're a real the-glass-is-haIf-empty
kind of a guy,

1796
01:13:11,792 --> 01:13:13,123
you know that?

1797
01:13:13,125 --> 01:13:15,286
I don't know how Barbara can stand it.

1798
01:13:15,292 --> 01:13:16,702
- Yeah.

1799
01:13:16,708 --> 01:13:17,993
- All right, I got one.

1800
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,115
My best day.

1801
01:13:19,125 --> 01:13:20,365
- This isn't the one about Arlene

1802
01:13:20,375 --> 01:13:21,364
and that loose step, is it?

1803
01:13:21,375 --> 01:13:22,285
- No-

1804
01:13:22,292 --> 01:13:23,281
No, my wedding day.

1805
01:13:24,375 --> 01:13:25,205
- What?

1806
01:13:25,208 --> 01:13:26,038
- Yeah.

1807
01:13:26,042 --> 01:13:27,077
Remember that day?

1808
01:13:27,083 --> 01:13:28,664
Outdoor wedding.

1809
01:13:28,667 --> 01:13:29,747
Arlene looked great.

1810
01:13:31,292 --> 01:13:33,032
Those water pills really worked.

1811
01:13:33,042 --> 01:13:34,828
You guys were all smiling at me.

1812
01:13:34,833 --> 01:13:39,782
And my dad, in the front, gives
me a little wink, you know?

1813
01:13:42,083 --> 01:13:46,656
I mean, he's not the warmest
of men, but he winked.

1814
01:13:46,667 --> 01:13:47,531
You know, I was the first one of us

1815
01:13:47,542 --> 01:13:48,907
to get married and have a real job

1816
01:13:48,917 --> 01:13:52,785
and I remember thinking, "I'm grown-up."

1817
01:13:52,792 --> 01:13:53,656
You know?

1818
01:13:53,667 --> 01:13:55,658
"I'm not a goofball anymore, I made it."

1819
01:13:57,583 --> 01:13:58,413
I felt like a man.

1820
01:14:00,667 --> 01:14:02,157
It was the best day of my life.

1821
01:14:03,792 --> 01:14:05,248
- What was your worst day?

1822
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:07,536
- Every day since is a tie.

1823
01:14:07,542 --> 01:14:09,749
(laughing)

1824
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:12,364
- All right, Ed, your best day.

1825
01:14:12,375 --> 01:14:13,865
What is it, twins and a trapeze?

1826
01:14:13,875 --> 01:14:15,536
What?
- No, I don't wanna play.

1827
01:14:15,542 --> 01:14:16,497
- Come on, we did it.

1828
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:17,615
- I don't feel like it.

1829
01:14:19,417 --> 01:14:20,202
- Okay.

1830
01:14:26,125 --> 01:14:29,322
- I'm 14 and my mother and
father are fighting again.

1831
01:14:29,333 --> 01:14:31,540
You know, because she caught him again.

1832
01:14:31,542 --> 01:14:32,782
Caught him.

1833
01:14:32,792 --> 01:14:35,454
This time, the girl drove
by the house to pick him up.

1834
01:14:37,667 --> 01:14:41,330
And I finally realized he wasn't
just cheating on my mother,

1835
01:14:41,333 --> 01:14:43,039
he was cheating on us.

1836
01:14:43,042 --> 01:14:43,827
So I told him.

1837
01:14:47,625 --> 01:14:49,331
"We don't love you.

1838
01:14:49,333 --> 01:14:50,994
"I'll take care of my
mother and my sister.

1839
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,116
"We don't need you anymore."

1840
01:14:53,125 --> 01:14:55,958
And he made like he was gonna
hit me, but I didn't budge.

1841
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,286
Then he turned around and he left.

1842
01:14:59,292 --> 01:15:00,532
Never bothered us again.

1843
01:15:01,792 --> 01:15:05,455
But I took care of my mother
and my sister from that day on.

1844
01:15:05,458 --> 01:15:06,493
That's my best day.

1845
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:09,490
- What was your worst day?

1846
01:15:11,042 --> 01:15:11,827
- Same day.

1847
01:15:13,792 --> 01:15:16,499
(dramatic music)

1848
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:19,080
(mumbling)

1849
01:15:19,083 --> 01:15:20,448
He gets the sign from Berra.

1850
01:15:20,458 --> 01:15:22,619
He gets the sign from Berra, the pitch.

1851
01:15:22,625 --> 01:15:25,162
(all whooping)

1852
01:15:37,167 --> 01:15:39,283
J‘ Rolling, rolling, rolling J‘

1853
01:15:39,292 --> 01:15:41,374
J‘ Keep them doggies rolling J‘

1854
01:15:41,375 --> 01:15:43,161
J‘ Man, my ass is swollen J‘

1855
01:15:43,167 --> 01:15:46,364
J‘ Rawhide J‘ J‘ Get them up, move them out J‘

1856
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:47,330
J‘ Wake them up, get them dressed J‘

1857
01:15:47,333 --> 01:15:49,449
I Get them shaved, comb
their hair, rawhide J‘

1858
01:15:49,458 --> 01:15:50,493
J‘ Tie me down, tell me lies J‘

1859
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:52,115
J‘ Pull my hair, smack my thighs J‘

1860
01:15:52,125 --> 01:15:56,243
I With a big wet strap of rawhide J‘

1861
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,787
(harmonica music)

1862
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:05,285
- Hyah.

1863
01:16:07,583 --> 01:16:08,538
Hyah!

1864
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:11,411
- What is he doing?

1865
01:16:11,417 --> 01:16:12,532
- [Cookie] Hyah, hyah!

1866
01:16:12,542 --> 01:16:14,407
(laughing)

1867
01:16:14,417 --> 01:16:16,032
Oh, I'm walking alone.

1868
01:16:16,042 --> 01:16:17,623
- He's drunk, the old shithead.

1869
01:16:17,625 --> 01:16:20,367
- Where'd he get the liquor?
- How do I know that?

1870
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:22,832
God dammit, we better
get him out of there.

1871
01:16:22,833 --> 01:16:25,449
(country music)

1872
01:16:26,458 --> 01:16:28,323
- Is that a happy face?

1873
01:16:28,333 --> 01:16:29,163
- [Cookie] Hyah!

1874
01:16:29,167 --> 01:16:30,452
(laughing)

1875
01:16:30,458 --> 01:16:31,789
- He's nuts.

1876
01:16:31,792 --> 01:16:33,874
(screaming)

1877
01:16:33,875 --> 01:16:34,705
- [T.R.] Stop!

1878
01:16:34,708 --> 01:16:36,198
Jeff, get him!

1879
01:16:36,208 --> 01:16:37,414
- [Jeff] Cookie!

1880
01:16:37,417 --> 01:16:39,123
- He's throwing our food.

1881
01:16:39,125 --> 01:16:40,786
- Well, we'll...
- We'll what?

1882
01:16:40,792 --> 01:16:41,622
We'll order out?

1883
01:16:43,125 --> 01:16:44,615
(horses neighing)

1884
01:16:44,625 --> 01:16:47,332
(Cookie screams)

1885
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:52,365
- He's headed for the ravine.

1886
01:16:52,375 --> 01:16:53,831
- I'm sure he sees it.

1887
01:16:53,833 --> 01:16:57,325
(country music)

1888
01:16:57,333 --> 01:16:58,163
(screaming)

1889
01:16:58,167 --> 01:16:59,247
- [Both] Jump!

1890
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:01,536
(screaming)

1891
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:07,411
(thudding)

1892
01:17:12,708 --> 01:17:15,120
- [Mitch] What can you say
about Skyrocket and Buttercup?

1893
01:17:15,125 --> 01:17:16,786
- Don't say anything.
Let's just get out of here.

1894
01:17:16,792 --> 01:17:18,623
- Wait, let's just recap
what we've buried so far

1895
01:17:18,625 --> 01:17:19,580
on this trip.

1896
01:17:19,583 --> 01:17:21,448
Trail boss, two horses--

1897
01:17:21,458 --> 01:17:23,198
- I can't believe we buried horses.

1898
01:17:23,208 --> 01:17:25,244
- Well, the impact really
drove them into the ground.

1899
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:27,161
We just covered them up with some dirt.

1900
01:17:28,583 --> 01:17:30,369
- How we gonna move
the food and the tents?

1901
01:17:30,375 --> 01:17:31,865
- The tents roll up.

1902
01:17:31,875 --> 01:17:35,743
We can pack enough food in our
saddlebags to get us there.

1903
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:36,739
- Okay.

1904
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:38,035
Let's do it.

1905
01:17:38,042 --> 01:17:39,748
- The problem is Cookie.

1906
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:41,581
Let's not forget his legs are broken.

1907
01:17:41,583 --> 01:17:42,698
- Oh, God, they're gonna shoot him.

1908
01:17:42,708 --> 01:17:43,743
I know it, they're gonna shoot him.

1909
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:45,206
- Now, we put Cookie on this litter

1910
01:17:45,208 --> 01:17:47,449
so we could get him out of here.

1911
01:17:47,458 --> 01:17:51,030
Both me and T.R. are gonna
stay with you all and the herd.

1912
01:17:51,042 --> 01:17:54,239
We're gonna be hitting some
pretty rough mountain country.

1913
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:57,242
There's a town, it's about
half a day's ride out of here.

1914
01:17:57,250 --> 01:17:59,081
I can draw a map.

1915
01:17:59,083 --> 01:18:01,324
Somebody's gotta take Cookie.

1916
01:18:01,333 --> 01:18:02,288
Volunteers?

1917
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:07,116
(cow mooing)

1918
01:18:08,792 --> 01:18:10,328
- I guess Steve and I should go.

1919
01:18:11,375 --> 01:18:12,364
- Why?

1920
01:18:12,375 --> 01:18:15,037
- Because he's injured and
we have medical training.

1921
01:18:15,042 --> 01:18:15,872
- Dad, but we're dentists!

1922
01:18:15,875 --> 01:18:17,490
I mean, what are we gonna
do, give him a cleaning?

1923
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:20,742
- We have a better chance of
helping him than anyone, son.

1924
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:22,490
- But you're having fun.

1925
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:24,161
- Ride with me.

1926
01:18:24,167 --> 01:18:26,579
It will still be fun, huh?

1927
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,786
- That's really great of you, Ben, Steve.

1928
01:18:30,792 --> 01:18:31,827
- [Bonnie] Yeah, thanks a lot,

1929
01:18:31,833 --> 01:18:32,868
that's great.
- Thank you.

1930
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:33,705
- Thanks, Ben.

1931
01:18:33,708 --> 01:18:34,538
- Good luck.

1932
01:18:34,542 --> 01:18:35,657
- [Ira] Thank you, Dr. Jessup, that's...

1933
01:18:35,667 --> 01:18:37,498
- We would have gone, but...

1934
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:38,706
- Good.

1935
01:18:38,708 --> 01:18:41,199
I'll make up that map.

1936
01:18:41,208 --> 01:18:42,288
- Hey, look!

1937
01:18:42,292 --> 01:18:44,374
I found where Cookie
was hiding his whiskey.

1938
01:18:44,375 --> 01:18:45,455
- [Jeff] You old coot.

1939
01:18:45,458 --> 01:18:46,243
- Hey, Jeff!

1940
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:48,580
(gun firing)

1941
01:18:48,583 --> 01:18:49,823
(glass crashing)
(whooping)

1942
01:18:49,833 --> 01:18:50,993
- Shouldn't we do something?

1943
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,490
- Let them have their fun,

1944
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:53,535
then they'll sleep it off.

1945
01:18:53,542 --> 01:18:54,531
- [Jeff] Swig.

1946
01:18:54,542 --> 01:18:55,372
(gun firing)
(whooping)

1947
01:18:55,375 --> 01:18:56,330
(glass crashing)

1948
01:18:56,333 --> 01:18:58,699
- I knew it, I knew we
couldn't trust these guys.

1949
01:18:58,708 --> 01:18:59,948
- I said, "Tennis camp."

1950
01:18:59,958 --> 01:19:02,119
You said, "Let's drive cattle."

1951
01:19:02,125 --> 01:19:03,661
- Wait a minute, I got an idea.

1952
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:08,160
(gun firing)
(glass crashing)

1953
01:19:08,167 --> 01:19:09,247
- Look at this.

1954
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:10,035
- [T.R.] Norman.

1955
01:19:11,667 --> 01:19:12,452
Norman.

1956
01:19:13,708 --> 01:19:15,414
- What are they doing with Norman?

1957
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:17,203
- [Jeff] Mitchy!

1958
01:19:17,208 --> 01:19:19,494
Mitchy, come on out and play.

1959
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:20,580
- Don't go out there.

1960
01:19:20,583 --> 01:19:21,789
- What do you think, I'm nuts?

1961
01:19:21,792 --> 01:19:24,955
(dramatic music)

1962
01:19:24,958 --> 01:19:27,870
- [Jeff] Mitch, do you like calf brains?

1963
01:19:30,083 --> 01:19:32,039
- [Ed] This is over a cow.

1964
01:19:32,042 --> 01:19:34,124
- [Jeff] Here's your last chance.

1965
01:19:34,125 --> 01:19:35,911
- They're not gonna hurt me.
There's too many witnesses.

1966
01:19:35,917 --> 01:19:37,453
- Please be careful.

1967
01:19:37,458 --> 01:19:39,119
- They're just gonna embarrass me.

1968
01:19:40,125 --> 01:19:40,955
So I'll let them.

1969
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:48,367
Norman, have you been
bothering the cowboys again?

1970
01:19:49,417 --> 01:19:51,032
You know, you raise them, you try

1971
01:19:51,042 --> 01:19:52,282
to teach them right from wrong,

1972
01:19:52,292 --> 01:19:53,998
but they learn these
things from their friends.

1973
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,581
I mean, it's the school systems.

1974
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:02,660
You're grounded, mister.

1975
01:20:05,167 --> 01:20:06,577
These cows today, huh?

1976
01:20:10,958 --> 01:20:13,495
- You pansy-assed bastard.

1977
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,161
- Are you talking to me or Norman?

1978
01:20:15,167 --> 01:20:18,580
- You shit-nosed little faggot.

1979
01:20:18,583 --> 01:20:19,698
- Oh, me?
- Mm-hm.

1980
01:20:21,708 --> 01:20:23,824
- Listen, guys, we have
a group of people here

1981
01:20:23,833 --> 01:20:25,869
who came out for a good time,

1982
01:20:25,875 --> 01:20:28,457
and to say the least, it's
been a little bit strange.

1983
01:20:31,167 --> 01:20:33,749
But we're counting on you
to get us through this.

1984
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:35,957
So I'm asking you, please,

1985
01:20:35,958 --> 01:20:38,620
why don't you just go
and sleep it off, huh?

1986
01:20:39,708 --> 01:20:40,788
- Sleep this off!

1987
01:20:40,792 --> 01:20:44,910
(thudding)
(groaning)

1988
01:20:44,917 --> 01:20:48,830
(thudding)
(groaning)

1989
01:20:48,833 --> 01:20:50,448
Yee-haw!

1990
01:20:50,458 --> 01:20:53,700
(thudding)
(groaning)

1991
01:20:53,708 --> 01:20:56,415
(dramatic music)

1992
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:01,241
(panting)

1993
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:02,239
- Put the gun down!

1994
01:21:03,208 --> 01:21:05,995
Put down the goddamn gun!

1995
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,707
(dramatic music)

1996
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,661
- Phil.

1997
01:21:11,667 --> 01:21:13,328
- I'm not going to let
him bully us anymore.

1998
01:21:14,292 --> 01:21:15,953
My father-in-law's a bully.

1999
01:21:15,958 --> 01:21:16,788
- [Mitch] Phil.

2000
01:21:16,792 --> 01:21:17,656
- I hate bullies!

2001
01:21:20,333 --> 01:21:22,289
Because a bully doesn't just beat you up.

2002
01:21:23,625 --> 01:21:25,161
He takes away your dignity.

2003
01:21:25,167 --> 01:21:25,952
- Phil!

2004
01:21:26,833 --> 01:21:27,663
- I hate that.

2005
01:21:29,125 --> 01:21:31,582
I really hate that.
(cocking gun)

2006
01:21:31,583 --> 01:21:34,450
(Yalping)

2007
01:21:34,458 --> 01:21:35,823
- Sorry.

2008
01:21:35,833 --> 01:21:38,540
(dramatic music)

2009
01:21:42,208 --> 01:21:44,324
(panting)

2010
01:21:45,958 --> 01:21:48,165
All right, you two
assholes, go sleep it off!

2011
01:21:51,875 --> 01:21:54,491
(groaning)

2012
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:55,615
And let's have some peace

2013
01:21:55,625 --> 01:21:58,537
and quiet around here for Christ's sakes!

2014
01:21:58,542 --> 01:22:00,248
(cow mooing)

2015
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:01,911
I'm tired!

2016
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:03,498
I've been under a lot of stress.

2017
01:22:04,833 --> 01:22:05,788
I lost my wife.

2018
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:07,990
I lost my job.

2019
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:12,989
And I've got some sort of rash
from making in the bushes.

2020
01:22:20,125 --> 01:22:21,410
- [Ed] Are you okay?

2021
01:22:21,417 --> 01:22:22,202
- Yeah.

2022
01:22:36,458 --> 01:22:37,948
- [Ed] Phil, thanks.

2023
01:22:37,958 --> 01:22:39,073
(Phil cocks gun)
That was amazing.

2024
01:22:40,583 --> 01:22:41,948
- What?

2025
01:22:41,958 --> 01:22:42,993
- [Ed] You know, uh...

2026
01:22:44,375 --> 01:22:45,160
- Oh, that.

2027
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:47,285
Yeah.

2028
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:51,411
- Why don't you put
the gun down, Phil, hm?

2029
01:22:52,417 --> 01:22:53,953
- Oh, no, you don't have to worry.

2030
01:22:53,958 --> 01:22:55,243
I know how to handle a gun.

2031
01:22:56,208 --> 01:22:58,540
I used to keep one at the store.

2032
01:22:58,542 --> 01:22:59,497
You know, you lock up late at night,

2033
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:00,910
there's a lot of cash around.

2034
01:23:04,333 --> 01:23:08,030
You got to make sure that the
register totals match the cash

2035
01:23:08,042 --> 01:23:12,991
and checks and the coupons and
then you got the order forms

2036
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,786
to fill out for the next day.

2037
01:23:14,792 --> 01:23:16,453
You've got to check the stock.

2038
01:23:16,458 --> 01:23:18,449
I mean, there's a lot to do there.

2039
01:23:18,458 --> 01:23:21,950
It's a very responsible job.

2040
01:23:21,958 --> 01:23:24,665
(dramatic music)

2041
01:23:28,625 --> 01:23:30,490
Oh, Christ!
(sobbing)

2042
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:33,287
(dramatic music)

2043
01:23:33,292 --> 01:23:35,157
- Oh, Phil.

2044
01:23:35,167 --> 01:23:36,247
Come on, Philly.

2045
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:37,865
Come on, man, it's not that bad.

2046
01:23:39,167 --> 01:23:40,703
- [Phil] I'm at a dead end.

2047
01:23:40,708 --> 01:23:43,745
I'm almost 40 years old,
I've wasted my life.

2048
01:23:43,750 --> 01:23:46,787
- Yeah, but now you got
a chance to start over.

2049
01:23:46,792 --> 01:23:47,577
You know?

2050
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:53,537
Phil, remember when we were kids?

2051
01:23:53,542 --> 01:23:55,749
And we'd be playing ball and
the ball would get stuck up

2052
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:57,456
in a tree or something?

2053
01:23:57,458 --> 01:23:59,244
And we'd yell, "Do over!", huh?

2054
01:23:59,250 --> 01:24:00,114
- Yeah.

2055
01:24:01,250 --> 01:24:02,706
- Your life is a do over.

2056
01:24:03,708 --> 01:24:04,948
You got a clean slate.

2057
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:07,706
- I got no place to live.

2058
01:24:09,167 --> 01:24:11,032
I'm going to get wiped out in the divorce

2059
01:24:11,042 --> 01:24:12,578
because I committed adultery.

2060
01:24:14,292 --> 01:24:16,203
So I may never even see my kids again.

2061
01:24:18,083 --> 01:24:18,868
I'm alone.

2062
01:24:22,542 --> 01:24:23,782
How's that slate look now?

2063
01:24:26,917 --> 01:24:29,533
- Well, the fun continues.

2064
01:24:29,542 --> 01:24:30,577
They're gone.

2065
01:24:30,583 --> 01:24:31,413
- Who?

2066
01:24:31,417 --> 01:24:32,497
- Jeff and T.R.

2067
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:33,660
They skedaddled.

2068
01:24:35,792 --> 01:24:38,374
- They jumped on their
horses and took off.

2069
01:24:38,375 --> 01:24:39,831
- They probably thought
we'd get them in trouble.

2070
01:24:39,833 --> 01:24:40,993
- Which we would.

2071
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,036
- Does anybody know how
to get where we're going?

2072
01:24:43,958 --> 01:24:45,744
(crickets chirping)

2073
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:47,536
- So we're talking death?

2074
01:24:47,542 --> 01:24:49,624
- No, wait, won't Ben
and Steve send some help?

2075
01:24:49,625 --> 01:24:51,206
- Maybe they won't.

2076
01:24:51,208 --> 01:24:53,915
I mean, when they left, we
were still pretty much okay.

2077
01:24:53,917 --> 01:24:55,407
- Still, they might.

2078
01:24:55,417 --> 01:24:56,532
- Might?

2079
01:24:56,542 --> 01:24:59,158
We're hanging our lives on Might!

2080
01:24:59,167 --> 01:25:01,624
- Let's not get hysterical here, okay?

2081
01:25:01,625 --> 01:25:02,614
Calm down.

2082
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:06,822
Now, for four days, we've
been going in this direction.

2083
01:25:06,833 --> 01:25:08,448
I think we keep going in that direction.

2084
01:25:08,458 --> 01:25:09,789
- Isn't that a little vague?

2085
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:13,742
- Curly said there was
a river and a valley.

2086
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:15,490
We'll just have to do the best we can.

2087
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:17,786
- So you're saying we can drive this herd?

2088
01:25:17,792 --> 01:25:19,123
- Herd?

2089
01:25:19,125 --> 01:25:20,205
Are you delirious?

2090
01:25:21,125 --> 01:25:23,116
We leave the herd.

2091
01:25:23,125 --> 01:25:24,865
We'll go times as fast without them.

2092
01:25:25,833 --> 01:25:27,369
- Well, yeah, but there's
no pasture land up here.

2093
01:25:27,375 --> 01:25:28,911
There's no water.

2094
01:25:28,917 --> 01:25:31,078
I don't think they can survive up here.

2095
01:25:31,083 --> 01:25:33,995
- Well, not to sound cold-hearted,
but so-the-hell-what?

2096
01:25:35,333 --> 01:25:37,699
No, I mean, they give us a
trail boss with a coronary,

2097
01:25:37,708 --> 01:25:39,039
they give us a bunch of drunks,

2098
01:25:39,042 --> 01:25:41,624
and we're supposed to
worry about the cattle?

2099
01:25:41,625 --> 01:25:43,206
You're a nicer person than I am.

2100
01:25:44,167 --> 01:25:45,122
- No, you're right.

2101
01:25:46,167 --> 01:25:47,782
- Look, the rest of you go ahead.

2102
01:25:47,792 --> 01:25:48,907
I'll drive the herd.

2103
01:25:48,917 --> 01:25:50,407
- What are you talking about?

2104
01:25:50,417 --> 01:25:52,624
- I'm saying I think I
can bring in the herd.

2105
01:25:52,625 --> 01:25:53,740
- No, you can't.

2106
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:54,990
What, are you crazy?

2107
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,490
You couldn't even manage your stores.

2108
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:58,286
You had to bring in your cousin.

2109
01:25:58,292 --> 01:26:01,455
- Mitch, you were right about
all the weekend warrior shit.

2110
01:26:01,458 --> 01:26:03,494
The war games, the parachuting.

2111
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:04,910
That was all bullshit.

2112
01:26:04,917 --> 01:26:06,077
But this is real.

2113
01:26:06,083 --> 01:26:07,198
This is really happening.

2114
01:26:07,208 --> 01:26:09,290
No rules, no games.

2115
01:26:09,292 --> 01:26:10,873
Just, can I do it?

2116
01:26:10,875 --> 01:26:12,160
- It is a game.

2117
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:14,408
It's your regular game,
Ed, don't you see it?

2118
01:26:14,417 --> 01:26:16,248
Am I better than my father?

2119
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:18,241
Well, you are, okay?

2120
01:26:18,250 --> 01:26:19,831
- Look, I need to do this.

2121
01:26:19,833 --> 01:26:21,243
- It's impossible.

2122
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:22,285
- I'll do it with you.

2123
01:26:24,833 --> 01:26:26,039
- Phil.

2124
01:26:26,042 --> 01:26:27,657
Phil...

2125
01:26:27,667 --> 01:26:29,999
You have, like, a day's
worth of food and water left.

2126
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:30,830
- We'll be all right.

2127
01:26:30,833 --> 01:26:31,663
- Maybe you won't.

2128
01:26:31,667 --> 01:26:33,032
- Well, maybe we will, Mitch.

2129
01:26:33,042 --> 01:26:33,997
Why don't you just accept

2130
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,581
that maybe you don't know
what we're going through?

2131
01:26:35,583 --> 01:26:38,165
- I know exactly what
you're going through.

2132
01:26:38,167 --> 01:26:39,748
And you think that bringing in this herd

2133
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:41,240
is gonna make all the broken pieces

2134
01:26:41,250 --> 01:26:42,831
of your life come together?

2135
01:26:42,833 --> 01:26:44,698
- Hey, you don't want
to do it, don't do it.

2136
01:26:44,708 --> 01:26:45,868
We want to do it.

2137
01:26:45,875 --> 01:26:46,955
- I'm not doing it.

2138
01:26:46,958 --> 01:26:47,788
- Don't do it.

2139
01:26:47,792 --> 01:26:49,498
I'm not asking you to do it.

2140
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:50,455
- You have been talking me

2141
01:26:50,458 --> 01:26:52,244
into doing stuff like this my whole life,

2142
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:54,115
and I am not doing this!

2143
01:26:54,125 --> 01:26:55,035
- What, are you deaf?

2144
01:26:55,042 --> 01:26:56,828
I'm not asking you to do it!

2145
01:26:56,833 --> 01:26:57,618
- Great!

2146
01:26:59,333 --> 01:27:00,118
- Come on, Phil.

2147
01:27:04,167 --> 01:27:05,577
(dramatic music)

2148
01:27:05,583 --> 01:27:06,368
- It's crazy.

2149
01:27:07,333 --> 01:27:10,040
(dramatic music)

2150
01:27:30,958 --> 01:27:34,780
We'll ride out together tomorrow
morning, without the herd.

2151
01:27:37,667 --> 01:27:39,248
They can do whatever they want.

2152
01:27:39,250 --> 01:27:41,957
(dramatic music)

2153
01:27:50,417 --> 01:27:53,124
(bird chirping)

2154
01:27:58,667 --> 01:28:01,625
- Come on, we've got cattle to move.

2155
01:28:05,708 --> 01:28:07,448
- [Phil] Hey, hey, hey, hey!

2156
01:28:07,458 --> 01:28:09,119
(whistling)
- [Ed] What are you doing?

2157
01:28:09,125 --> 01:28:10,160
- [Phil] I'm not listening to you!

2158
01:28:10,167 --> 01:28:11,327
- [Ed] Fine, listen to the cows, then.

2159
01:28:11,333 --> 01:28:13,198
- Goddamn cattle drive!
- Just do your job!

2160
01:28:13,208 --> 01:28:15,039
- [Phil] Don't tell me, I'm
not listening to you anymore.

2161
01:28:15,042 --> 01:28:15,997
- Listen to the cows!

2162
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,490
- Come on, you damn little doggies!

2163
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:18,330
Move it!
- Come on, let's go!

2164
01:28:18,333 --> 01:28:20,540
- [Phil] Hey, stop that!

2165
01:28:20,542 --> 01:28:21,622
Cut that out!

2166
01:28:21,625 --> 01:28:22,740
- Phil, what are you doing?

2167
01:28:22,750 --> 01:28:23,739
- They're not cooperating.

2168
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:25,490
This is like herding my children.

2169
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:27,036
- You take those, I'll take these.

2170
01:28:27,042 --> 01:28:28,657
- Hey, hey, come back here!

2171
01:28:28,667 --> 01:28:30,077
(Whistles)

2172
01:28:30,083 --> 01:28:32,039
Hey, stop!

2173
01:28:32,042 --> 01:28:33,157
Stop it!

2174
01:28:33,167 --> 01:28:33,997
Stop!

2175
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,365
Get back here!

2176
01:28:35,375 --> 01:28:36,911
Ah, the hell with you!

2177
01:28:36,917 --> 01:28:39,454
Who needs you, anyway?!

2178
01:28:39,458 --> 01:28:41,699
(cows mooing)

2179
01:28:41,708 --> 01:28:44,620
(playful music)

2180
01:28:44,625 --> 01:28:45,740
What the heck!

2181
01:28:47,417 --> 01:28:48,873
How did I do that?

2182
01:28:50,542 --> 01:28:52,749
(thrilling music)

2183
01:28:52,750 --> 01:28:54,206
Hey, Mitch!

2184
01:28:54,208 --> 01:28:56,915
(horse neighing)

2185
01:28:59,167 --> 01:28:59,997
It's Mitch!

2186
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:00,955
(horse neighing)

2187
01:29:00,958 --> 01:29:02,414
Mitchy the Kid!

2188
01:29:02,417 --> 01:29:05,375
- Curly said there's nothing
like bringing in the herd.

2189
01:29:05,375 --> 01:29:09,072
(thrilling orchestral music)

2190
01:29:17,333 --> 01:29:18,448
- Nice hat, partner.

2191
01:29:21,625 --> 01:29:22,455
(horse neighing)

2192
01:29:22,458 --> 01:29:23,288
Come on.

2193
01:29:23,292 --> 01:29:25,203
- Hey, there's my little man.

2194
01:29:25,208 --> 01:29:27,824
Sorry I was late, but
there was so much traffic.

2195
01:29:27,833 --> 01:29:28,788
Let's go, hyah!

2196
01:29:28,792 --> 01:29:31,579
(thrilling music)

2197
01:29:34,417 --> 01:29:37,580
There's nothing to be ashamed
of, I had the same problem.

2198
01:29:37,583 --> 01:29:38,663
- [Phil] Didn't you feel stupid?

2199
01:29:38,667 --> 01:29:40,248
I mean...

2200
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:42,912
Didn't you feel inadequate?

2201
01:29:42,917 --> 01:29:45,374
- [Mitch] Yeah, for a while,
but then I overcame it.

2202
01:29:46,333 --> 01:29:47,664
Can I explain it you again?

2203
01:29:47,667 --> 01:29:49,828
I mean, promise me you won't get upset.

2204
01:29:49,833 --> 01:29:51,289
- [Phil] Okay.

2205
01:29:51,292 --> 01:29:52,748
It's not going to do any good.

2206
01:29:53,667 --> 01:29:54,577
- Okay.

2207
01:29:54,583 --> 01:29:56,244
If you want to watch one show,

2208
01:29:56,250 --> 01:29:58,206
but record another show at the same time,

2209
01:29:58,208 --> 01:30:00,870
the television set does not
have to be on channel three.

2210
01:30:00,875 --> 01:30:01,705
- It does.

2211
01:30:01,708 --> 01:30:02,538
- No, it doesn't.
- It does.

2212
01:30:02,542 --> 01:30:03,782
- No, if you're watching
what you're recording,

2213
01:30:03,792 --> 01:30:04,998
then it has to be on three.

2214
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,412
- Wait, the TV or the machine?

2215
01:30:07,417 --> 01:30:08,748
- The TV.

2216
01:30:08,750 --> 01:30:09,990
- You're saying I can record something

2217
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:10,955
I'm not even watching?

2218
01:30:10,958 --> 01:30:11,993
- Yes, that's the point.

2219
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,366
You don't even need a TV to record.

2220
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:15,205
- How would I see it?

2221
01:30:15,208 --> 01:30:17,415
- Well, to see it, you need a TV, but--

2222
01:30:17,417 --> 01:30:18,247
- Shut up.

2223
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:19,080
Just shut up!

2224
01:30:19,083 --> 01:30:20,539
He doesn't get it!

2225
01:30:20,542 --> 01:30:21,907
He'll never get it.

2226
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:23,032
It's been four hours.

2227
01:30:23,042 --> 01:30:25,374
The cows can tape something by now.

2228
01:30:25,375 --> 01:30:27,832
Forget about it, please!

2229
01:30:27,833 --> 01:30:29,869
(cows mooing)

2230
01:30:29,875 --> 01:30:31,240
- How do you do the clock?

2231
01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:32,205
- You're dead.

2232
01:30:32,208 --> 01:30:33,038
You are dead!

2233
01:30:33,042 --> 01:30:37,991
(all whooping)
(playful music)

2234
01:30:44,167 --> 01:30:46,624
(cows mooing)

2235
01:30:50,917 --> 01:30:53,784
(thunder rumbling)

2236
01:30:56,250 --> 01:30:57,615
- Ya, ya, ya, ya!

2237
01:30:58,833 --> 01:30:59,663
Let's go!

2238
01:30:59,667 --> 01:31:01,953
Come on, Norman, keep up, boy, keep up!

2239
01:31:01,958 --> 01:31:03,073
Norman,
(Norman bleats)

2240
01:31:03,083 --> 01:31:03,947
stay with the class.

2241
01:31:03,958 --> 01:31:05,118
Come on, boy!

2242
01:31:05,125 --> 01:31:05,989
- Oh, shit.

2243
01:31:07,542 --> 01:31:08,782
- What do we do now?

2244
01:31:08,792 --> 01:31:10,453
- [Mitch] Like I should know?

2245
01:31:10,458 --> 01:31:11,914
- Come on, let's keep the herd together.

2246
01:31:11,917 --> 01:31:13,032
- Yeah, let's go.

2247
01:31:13,042 --> 01:31:14,703
Norman, hello!

2248
01:31:14,708 --> 01:31:15,663
Let's go, Norman.

2249
01:31:15,667 --> 01:31:17,908
Norman, what are you, Gene Kelly?

2250
01:31:17,917 --> 01:31:18,997
Let's go.

2251
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,457
(cows mooing)

2252
01:31:27,708 --> 01:31:30,905
(thunder rumbling)

2253
01:31:30,917 --> 01:31:31,747
Ah!

2254
01:31:31,750 --> 01:31:34,366
Whoa, whoa, easy, boy, easy boy!

2255
01:31:36,750 --> 01:31:37,580
Move it!

2256
01:31:37,583 --> 01:31:38,368
Go, go!

2257
01:31:40,333 --> 01:31:43,040
(dramatic music)

2258
01:31:45,917 --> 01:31:49,239
(cows mooing)

2259
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:50,490
- We're doing great, guys.

2260
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:51,489
We're driving them.

2261
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:52,865
- Oh, that's perfect.

2262
01:31:52,875 --> 01:31:54,581
We're lost, but we're making good time.

2263
01:31:54,583 --> 01:31:55,789
- This is the way, guys.

2264
01:31:55,792 --> 01:31:57,157
I can feel it.

2265
01:31:57,167 --> 01:31:59,874
(dramatic music)

2266
01:32:06,083 --> 01:32:07,289
(horse neighing)

2267
01:32:07,292 --> 01:32:10,159
(thunder rumbling)

2268
01:32:15,417 --> 01:32:16,953
- Is there a way around?

2269
01:32:16,958 --> 01:32:18,164
- That could be 100 miles.

2270
01:32:18,167 --> 01:32:19,532
It could take days.

2271
01:32:19,542 --> 01:32:21,498
- Is this supposed to be here?

2272
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:24,697
- There's probably an easy place
to cross, but we missed it.

2273
01:32:24,708 --> 01:32:27,074
- This could be the easy place!

2274
01:32:27,083 --> 01:32:28,368
- Oh, God.

2275
01:32:28,375 --> 01:32:30,366
- Look, we did the best we could.

2276
01:32:30,375 --> 01:32:33,208
Let's just leave the herd and
get the hell out of here, huh?

2277
01:32:33,208 --> 01:32:34,869
- No-

2278
01:32:34,875 --> 01:32:37,207
A cowboy doesn't leave his herd.

2279
01:32:37,208 --> 01:32:39,665
- You are a sporting goods salesman!

2280
01:32:42,167 --> 01:32:43,373
- Not today.

2281
01:32:43,375 --> 01:32:46,082
(dramatic music)

2282
01:32:49,458 --> 01:32:50,288
Easy.

2283
01:32:50,292 --> 01:32:51,281
Okay.

2284
01:32:51,292 --> 01:32:53,328
I'm gonna lean back.

2285
01:32:53,333 --> 01:32:56,655
I started this, and
I'm going to finish it.

2286
01:32:56,667 --> 01:32:58,453
(horse neighing)
I'm going to finish it.

2287
01:32:58,458 --> 01:33:01,165
(dramatic music)

2288
01:33:06,333 --> 01:33:08,119
It's fast, but it's not deep.

2289
01:33:08,125 --> 01:33:10,161
Come on, bring them down!

2290
01:33:11,292 --> 01:33:12,077
Come on!

2291
01:33:13,042 --> 01:33:14,031
Let's go!

2292
01:33:14,042 --> 01:33:16,749
(dramatic music)

2293
01:33:19,875 --> 01:33:20,660
- Oh, God.

2294
01:33:22,125 --> 01:33:24,707
- [Ed] Oh, yeah, oh, yeah!

2295
01:33:24,708 --> 01:33:26,824
Move it, move it, move it!

2296
01:33:28,417 --> 01:33:29,702
Come on.

2297
01:33:29,708 --> 01:33:30,493
Come on.

2298
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:32,285
Yeah.

2299
01:33:34,167 --> 01:33:35,282
- [Phil] Come on!

2300
01:33:35,292 --> 01:33:36,452
Come on!

2301
01:33:36,458 --> 01:33:39,165
(dramatic music)

2302
01:33:45,333 --> 01:33:46,413
- Come on, move!

2303
01:33:46,417 --> 01:33:47,372
Move it!

2304
01:33:47,375 --> 01:33:48,956
Come on!

2305
01:33:48,958 --> 01:33:51,324
(Whistles)

2306
01:33:51,333 --> 01:33:53,494
- [Ed] Come on, move it!

2307
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:54,285
Yah, yah!

2308
01:33:55,667 --> 01:33:57,623
- Move it, cow, come on!

2309
01:33:58,750 --> 01:34:02,618
(horse neighing)
Whoa!

2310
01:34:02,625 --> 01:34:04,240
Shit!

2311
01:34:04,250 --> 01:34:05,706
- [Phil] Ya!

2312
01:34:05,708 --> 01:34:06,538
Come on!

2313
01:34:06,542 --> 01:34:08,203
Come on, let's move it!

2314
01:34:08,208 --> 01:34:09,414
Get over there.

2315
01:34:11,167 --> 01:34:12,623
- [Mitch] Come on!

2316
01:34:15,083 --> 01:34:16,198
- [Ed] Ya, ya!

2317
01:34:19,750 --> 01:34:20,660
- Come on, boys!

2318
01:34:20,667 --> 01:34:21,702
Come on, now.

2319
01:34:21,708 --> 01:34:22,868
Move it!

2320
01:34:22,875 --> 01:34:23,864
Moo, cow!

2321
01:34:23,875 --> 01:34:25,115
- Go, baby!

2322
01:34:25,125 --> 01:34:25,955
Go, baby!

2323
01:34:25,958 --> 01:34:30,748
- Phil, I'm 39 and I'm
saying moo cow in a river.

2324
01:34:30,750 --> 01:34:32,160
Do you believe this?

2325
01:34:32,167 --> 01:34:33,407
(laughing)

2326
01:34:33,417 --> 01:34:34,577
- We did it!

2327
01:34:34,583 --> 01:34:35,698
- Hey!

2328
01:34:35,708 --> 01:34:38,825
(dramatic music)

2329
01:34:38,833 --> 01:34:40,949
- [Mitch] Ya, ya, come on!

2330
01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:43,205
Ya, come on!

2331
01:34:44,125 --> 01:34:46,832
(dramatic music)

2332
01:34:47,917 --> 01:34:49,623
Yeah, baby, woo, woo!

2333
01:34:50,958 --> 01:34:51,743
- Ya!

2334
01:34:56,667 --> 01:34:57,577
Here we go!

2335
01:34:57,583 --> 01:35:00,370
(Norman bleating)

2336
01:35:03,292 --> 01:35:04,327
- Norman!

2337
01:35:04,333 --> 01:35:06,665
(dramatic music)

2338
01:35:06,667 --> 01:35:07,827
Oh, God.

2339
01:35:07,833 --> 01:35:08,663
Hyah!

2340
01:35:08,667 --> 01:35:10,874
(bleating)

2341
01:35:17,083 --> 01:35:18,744
Hyah, hyah.

2342
01:35:18,750 --> 01:35:20,081
Come on, come on.

2343
01:35:20,083 --> 01:35:22,290
(bleating)

2344
01:35:27,875 --> 01:35:28,660
Yeah!

2345
01:35:30,083 --> 01:35:32,790
(dramatic music)

2346
01:35:42,458 --> 01:35:43,288
(horse neighing)

2347
01:35:43,292 --> 01:35:44,122
Whoa!

2348
01:35:44,125 --> 01:35:46,241
(splashing)

2349
01:35:46,250 --> 01:35:48,957
(horse neighing)

2350
01:35:53,708 --> 01:35:54,493
Norman!

2351
01:35:57,917 --> 01:35:58,702
Norman!

2352
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:03,032
Norman!

2353
01:36:03,042 --> 01:36:03,827
Norman!

2354
01:36:05,458 --> 01:36:06,243
Norman!

2355
01:36:08,042 --> 01:36:10,658
(bleating)

2356
01:36:10,667 --> 01:36:11,452
Got you.

2357
01:36:12,750 --> 01:36:13,580
Help!

2358
01:36:13,583 --> 01:36:14,618
- Oh, my God.

2359
01:36:14,625 --> 01:36:15,489
Mitch!

2360
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:16,330
Hey, Ed!

2361
01:36:16,333 --> 01:36:17,493
- [Mitch] Help!

2362
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:18,285
Help me!

2363
01:36:20,708 --> 01:36:21,823
- Hyah, hyah!

2364
01:36:21,833 --> 01:36:22,618
- Oh, no!

2365
01:36:28,583 --> 01:36:29,368
- Mitch!

2366
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:32,786
(screaming)

2367
01:36:39,958 --> 01:36:40,993
(bleating)

2368
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,331
(thudding)

2369
01:36:42,333 --> 01:36:45,825
(dramatic music)

2370
01:36:45,833 --> 01:36:48,415
(groaning)

2371
01:36:48,417 --> 01:36:49,281
- Oh, Shit!

2372
01:37:15,250 --> 01:37:16,285
- [Ed] Mitch!

2373
01:37:19,042 --> 01:37:21,283
(bleating)

2374
01:37:21,292 --> 01:37:22,077
Mitch!

2375
01:37:23,292 --> 01:37:25,704
- [Phil] I'm coming!

2376
01:37:25,708 --> 01:37:26,572
I'm
c

ming

2377
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:32,365
(bleating)
- Help, help!

2378
01:37:32,375 --> 01:37:35,082
- I got you, I got you!

2379
01:37:35,083 --> 01:37:36,368
Come on, come on!

2380
01:37:36,375 --> 01:37:37,865
Come on, come on!

2381
01:37:37,875 --> 01:37:39,740
Come on, come on, come on!

2382
01:37:39,750 --> 01:37:42,036
(screaming)

2383
01:37:43,250 --> 01:37:44,160
- [Ed] I've got you.

2384
01:37:44,167 --> 01:37:45,623
I've got you.

2385
01:37:45,625 --> 01:37:47,832
(bleating)

2386
01:37:48,958 --> 01:37:51,165
(groaning)

2387
01:37:56,833 --> 01:37:57,788
- [Phil] Give me your hand!

2388
01:37:57,792 --> 01:37:59,328
Give me your hand!

2389
01:37:59,333 --> 01:38:01,540
(groaning)

2390
01:38:05,333 --> 01:38:06,789
(laughing)

2391
01:38:06,792 --> 01:38:08,077
- You're crazy.

2392
01:38:08,083 --> 01:38:10,324
You talk about me, but you're crazy.

2393
01:38:12,167 --> 01:38:13,498
- You could have been killed!

2394
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:15,081
- We almost lost you, pal.

2395
01:38:16,083 --> 01:38:18,199
(panting)

2396
01:38:24,958 --> 01:38:25,868
- Nice catch.

2397
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:30,786
It was like Mays in the '54 World Series.

2398
01:38:31,875 --> 01:38:33,581
- Vic Wertz.
- Vic Wertz.

2399
01:38:37,042 --> 01:38:39,328
(chuckﬁng)

2400
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:03,947
(soft instrumental music)

2401
01:39:11,125 --> 01:39:13,582
(cows mooing)

2402
01:39:30,917 --> 01:39:34,455
(intense orchestral music)

2403
01:39:47,583 --> 01:39:50,199
(Norman bleats)

2404
01:39:51,333 --> 01:39:52,573
- Let's bring them in.

2405
01:39:52,583 --> 01:39:53,789
- Yee-haw!

2406
01:39:53,792 --> 01:39:54,952
- Yee-haw!
- Yee-haw!

2407
01:39:54,958 --> 01:39:59,907
(chiming)
(thrilling music)

2408
01:40:03,917 --> 01:40:05,953
- Great gobs of goose shit!

2409
01:40:07,125 --> 01:40:07,955
- It's them!

2410
01:40:07,958 --> 01:40:09,664
Ira, Ira, camera, camera!

2411
01:40:09,667 --> 01:40:11,282
(laughing)

2412
01:40:11,292 --> 01:40:12,452
- Yahoo!

2413
01:40:12,458 --> 01:40:13,994
Yeah!

2414
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:17,288
(all hum Bonanza theme)

2415
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,207
(whooping)

2416
01:40:40,333 --> 01:40:45,282
(whooping)
(lively orchestral music)

2417
01:40:57,167 --> 01:40:59,374
(laughing)

2418
01:41:00,750 --> 01:41:02,957
(whooping)

2419
01:41:08,167 --> 01:41:08,997
(whistling)

2420
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:09,830
- Come on!

2421
01:41:09,833 --> 01:41:10,788
Yeah!

2422
01:41:10,792 --> 01:41:11,577
- Yeah!

2423
01:41:20,750 --> 01:41:21,580
- [Ben] Mitch!

2424
01:41:21,583 --> 01:41:24,120
(all cheering)

2425
01:41:26,042 --> 01:41:27,157
- Yahoo!

2426
01:41:27,167 --> 01:41:28,407
- Hey, the drinks!

2427
01:41:28,417 --> 01:41:31,864
(lively orchestral music)

2428
01:41:32,917 --> 01:41:34,282
- Way to go, guys.

2429
01:41:34,292 --> 01:41:37,034
(murmuring)

2430
01:41:41,667 --> 01:41:43,783
- [Clay] All right.

2431
01:41:43,792 --> 01:41:45,783
- [Millie] You did great.

2432
01:41:45,792 --> 01:41:47,578
- Oh, Lordy, Lord, Lord.

2433
01:41:50,583 --> 01:41:52,164
(sighs)

2434
01:41:52,167 --> 01:41:53,247
- Here's your herd.

2435
01:41:53,250 --> 01:41:56,322
- I'm telling you, I'm as happy
as a puppy with two peters.

2436
01:41:56,333 --> 01:41:58,699
We had a search party
out looking for you boys.

2437
01:41:58,708 --> 01:42:00,539
- [Ed] They didn't find us.

2438
01:42:00,542 --> 01:42:03,158
- Un-by-God-believable!

2439
01:42:03,167 --> 01:42:05,123
Bunch of tenderfeet bringing
in a herd like that.

2440
01:42:05,125 --> 01:42:07,537
Two weeks ago, you boys were
as worthless as hen shit

2441
01:42:07,542 --> 01:42:08,952
on a pump handle.

2442
01:42:08,958 --> 01:42:09,913
And look at you now.

2443
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,082
I'm giving your money back!

2444
01:42:13,083 --> 01:42:14,198
Oh, this one's on me.

2445
01:42:14,208 --> 01:42:16,324
- Now you're talking, Clay!

2446
01:42:16,333 --> 01:42:17,448
- Hey, uh--
- That's right.

2447
01:42:17,458 --> 01:42:18,573
- Instead of the money, you think

2448
01:42:18,583 --> 01:42:20,448
that my dad and I could come back

2449
01:42:20,458 --> 01:42:23,370
and take the cattle back to New Mexico?

2450
01:42:23,375 --> 01:42:24,239
- [Ben] Really, son?

2451
01:42:24,250 --> 01:42:26,206
- Ordinarily, that'd be great,

2452
01:42:26,208 --> 01:42:28,449
but this herd's not going back.

2453
01:42:28,458 --> 01:42:29,698
- What do you mean?

2454
01:42:29,708 --> 01:42:31,949
- I'm getting top dollar
from the meat company.

2455
01:42:33,625 --> 01:42:35,286
- You mean these cows are...

2456
01:42:35,292 --> 01:42:37,408
- I thought you just
moved them back and forth?

2457
01:42:37,417 --> 01:42:40,079
- Usually do, but prices are sky high,

2458
01:42:40,083 --> 01:42:41,198
and I can't pass it up.

2459
01:42:42,167 --> 01:42:44,624
(cows mooing)

2460
01:42:47,208 --> 01:42:48,744
Look, folks, it's not like any

2461
01:42:48,750 --> 01:42:51,036
of them have a lot to live for.

2462
01:42:51,042 --> 01:42:53,124
They don't have much of a life, anyway.

2463
01:42:53,125 --> 01:42:55,582
- Neither does Phil, but
we're not prepared to eat him.

2464
01:42:55,583 --> 01:42:56,948
- That's right.

2465
01:42:56,958 --> 01:42:58,949
- This is our business, son.

2466
01:42:58,958 --> 01:43:01,074
This is not an endangered species.

2467
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:05,082
It's what these animals are bred for.

2468
01:43:05,083 --> 01:43:07,449
All that meat under
cellophane in the supermarket,

2469
01:43:07,458 --> 01:43:09,574
where do you think that comes from?

2470
01:43:09,583 --> 01:43:11,039
Come on, fellows, just relax.

2471
01:43:11,958 --> 01:43:14,324
You've done real good, cowboys.

2472
01:43:14,333 --> 01:43:15,288
Let's get some grub.

2473
01:43:16,708 --> 01:43:18,949
- [Barry] Bet you guys could use a nap?

2474
01:43:19,917 --> 01:43:21,123
(cows mooing)

2475
01:43:21,125 --> 01:43:21,955
You look dirty.

2476
01:43:21,958 --> 01:43:22,788
- [Ben] Did you mean that, son?

2477
01:43:23,958 --> 01:43:27,655
- [Steve] Yeah, we'll
come back that's great.

2478
01:43:33,375 --> 01:43:34,706
- These cows trusted us.

2479
01:43:35,833 --> 01:43:36,868
- They trusted us?

2480
01:43:37,917 --> 01:43:39,453
They don't even know us!

2481
01:43:39,458 --> 01:43:42,200
They followed us because we yelled Yah!

2482
01:43:42,208 --> 01:43:43,618
They're cattle.

2483
01:43:43,625 --> 01:43:46,332
(dramatic music)

2484
01:43:56,292 --> 01:43:58,624
(cows mooing)

2485
01:43:58,625 --> 01:44:01,332
(dramatic music)

2486
01:44:15,917 --> 01:44:17,373
(Norman bleats)

2487
01:44:17,375 --> 01:44:20,082
(dramatic music)

2488
01:44:28,167 --> 01:44:30,078
(Norman bleats)

2489
01:44:30,083 --> 01:44:32,790
(dramatic music)

2490
01:44:36,292 --> 01:44:37,873
- What?

2491
01:44:37,875 --> 01:44:40,582
(dramatic music)

2492
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,616
(Norman bleats)

2493
01:45:15,458 --> 01:45:17,790
- I've got to stop being a schmuck.

2494
01:45:18,875 --> 01:45:20,285
You know, you were right, Mitch.

2495
01:45:21,333 --> 01:45:22,618
My life is a do over.

2496
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,206
It's time to get started.

2497
01:45:27,792 --> 01:45:28,577
- I hope I can help.

2498
01:45:31,917 --> 01:45:32,997
- I'm going to go home

2499
01:45:34,250 --> 01:45:36,332
and I'm going to get Kim pregnant.

2500
01:45:36,333 --> 01:45:37,743
- I hope I can help.

2501
01:45:37,750 --> 01:45:42,699
- Oh, Mitchy the Kid's in trouble.

2502
01:45:43,250 --> 01:45:44,410
What about you?

2503
01:45:44,417 --> 01:45:45,907
- [Mitch] Hm?

2504
01:45:45,917 --> 01:45:47,657
- You going to be okay?

2505
01:45:47,667 --> 01:45:49,828
- Yeah, because I know what he meant.

2506
01:45:49,833 --> 01:45:50,663
- [Phil] Who?

2507
01:45:50,667 --> 01:45:51,827
- Curly.

2508
01:45:51,833 --> 01:45:53,198
I know what this is.

2509
01:45:53,208 --> 01:45:54,243
- [Ed] What?

2510
01:45:54,250 --> 01:45:55,205
- That's what you have to figure out.

2511
01:45:55,208 --> 01:45:56,948
- I'm going to deck you, pal.

2512
01:45:56,958 --> 01:45:58,198
- No, that's what it is.

2513
01:45:58,208 --> 01:45:59,823
It's something different for everybody.

2514
01:45:59,833 --> 01:46:02,074
It's whatever's most important to you.

2515
01:46:02,083 --> 01:46:04,574
For me, when I was in the river,

2516
01:46:04,583 --> 01:46:06,665
I was only thinking about one thing.

2517
01:46:06,667 --> 01:46:09,249
All that other stuff just went away.

2518
01:46:09,250 --> 01:46:11,036
Only one thing really mattered to me.

2519
01:46:12,792 --> 01:46:13,656
- [Both] Dad!

2520
01:46:13,667 --> 01:46:15,703
- [Danny] Daddy, you're home!

2521
01:46:15,708 --> 01:46:17,915
(laughing)

2522
01:46:18,917 --> 01:46:20,077
- Oh, God.

2523
01:46:20,083 --> 01:46:21,072
- [Holly] I love you.

2524
01:46:22,833 --> 01:46:23,868
- These faces.

2525
01:46:23,875 --> 01:46:25,081
I missed these faces.

2526
01:46:25,083 --> 01:46:26,414
- We missed you too, Dad.

2527
01:46:26,417 --> 01:46:27,702
- It's no fun without you.

2528
01:46:28,917 --> 01:46:29,872
- Hey, buckaroos.

2529
01:46:32,208 --> 01:46:34,164
Next year, the North Pole.

2530
01:46:34,167 --> 01:46:34,997
- What?

2531
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,082
- We hire dog sleds and
we follow the same route

2532
01:46:37,083 --> 01:46:38,493
as Admiral Byrd.

2533
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:39,580
- Uh-huh.

2534
01:46:39,583 --> 01:46:42,700
Next Tuesday, coffee and cake.

2535
01:46:42,708 --> 01:46:43,868
- Better.

2536
01:46:43,875 --> 01:46:45,081
Come here.

2537
01:46:45,083 --> 01:46:47,620
(Kim chuckles)

2538
01:46:49,708 --> 01:46:50,663
- Hey, Phil!

2539
01:46:50,667 --> 01:46:51,998
You need a ride?

2540
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:53,240
- No, thanks, I got a cab.

2541
01:46:54,875 --> 01:46:57,742
(people murmuring)

2542
01:47:03,750 --> 01:47:06,457
(dramatic music)

2543
01:47:09,708 --> 01:47:11,744
- So, how are you?

2544
01:47:11,750 --> 01:47:12,785
- Good.

2545
01:47:12,792 --> 01:47:14,453
Things are good.

2546
01:47:14,458 --> 01:47:15,322
Look what I found.

2547
01:47:18,167 --> 01:47:20,032
- Mm, that's nice.

2548
01:47:20,042 --> 01:47:21,282
Where was it?

2549
01:47:21,292 --> 01:47:22,828
- Colorado.

2550
01:47:22,833 --> 01:47:24,824
I mean, it's always the
last place you look.

2551
01:47:24,833 --> 01:47:26,915
(laughing)

2552
01:47:26,917 --> 01:47:28,407
- Mitch, I've been thinking.

2553
01:47:29,667 --> 01:47:32,659
If you really hate your job,
why don't you get out of there?

2554
01:47:32,667 --> 01:47:33,577
We'll be all right.

2555
01:47:34,625 --> 01:47:35,535
- No-

2556
01:47:35,542 --> 01:47:37,123
I'm not going to quit my job.

2557
01:47:37,125 --> 01:47:38,661
I'm just going to do it better.

2558
01:47:38,667 --> 01:47:40,328
I'm going to do everything better.

2559
01:47:41,833 --> 01:47:43,164
- Everything?

2560
01:47:43,167 --> 01:47:45,874
(dramatic music)

2561
01:47:59,958 --> 01:48:00,743
- See?

2562
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,365
- Oh, I missed you.

2563
01:48:03,375 --> 01:48:04,706
- [Mitch] I missed you, too.

2564
01:48:06,167 --> 01:48:07,077
- Let's go home.

2565
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,787
- Today is my best day.

2566
01:48:10,792 --> 01:48:13,499
(dramatic music)

2567
01:48:16,875 --> 01:48:17,660
- Mr. Robbins!

2568
01:48:18,708 --> 01:48:20,289
- Yeah, right here.

2569
01:48:20,292 --> 01:48:21,953
(playful music)

2570
01:48:21,958 --> 01:48:22,743
This is great.

2571
01:48:25,042 --> 01:48:26,748
There you go, thanks.

2572
01:48:27,667 --> 01:48:29,498
- What, did you get a dog?

2573
01:48:29,500 --> 01:48:31,661
- We got a dog?
- All right!

2574
01:48:31,667 --> 01:48:32,998
- Come on, little man.

2575
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:36,367
(Norman bleats)

2576
01:48:36,375 --> 01:48:38,957
Everyone, this is Norman.

2577
01:48:41,250 --> 01:48:42,706
- It's a cow.

2578
01:48:42,708 --> 01:48:46,075
- Uh, he's a calf, actually.

2579
01:48:46,083 --> 01:48:46,868
- Mitch!

2580
01:48:47,917 --> 01:48:49,953
You're going to put him in the van?

2581
01:48:49,958 --> 01:48:51,949
- Oh, yeah, and then the den.

2582
01:48:51,958 --> 01:48:52,788
- [Barbara] Mitch, you're not going

2583
01:48:52,792 --> 01:48:53,872
to take him home.
(Norman bleats)

2584
01:48:53,875 --> 01:48:55,786
- See, kids, he just said hellooo.

2585
01:48:55,792 --> 01:48:56,872
(kids laugh)

2586
01:48:56,875 --> 01:48:58,957
Well, just for a little while.

2587
01:48:58,958 --> 01:49:00,448
Then we'll put him in a petting zoo,

2588
01:49:00,458 --> 01:49:01,743
so he can be with your mother.

2589
01:49:01,750 --> 01:49:02,956
- [Barbara] Mitch!

2590
01:49:02,958 --> 01:49:04,994
(Barbara laughs)

2591
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:05,830
- I'm kidding.

2592
01:49:05,833 --> 01:49:07,414
I'm just kidding!
- All right.

2593
01:49:11,208 --> 01:49:12,163
- All right.

2594
01:49:13,083 --> 01:49:13,913
(kids laugh)

2595
01:49:13,917 --> 01:49:15,782
Okay, seat belts, Norman, seat belts.

2596
01:49:15,792 --> 01:49:16,907
- Mitch!

2597
01:49:16,917 --> 01:49:18,373
- I hope you went to the bathroom, mister.

2598
01:49:18,375 --> 01:49:20,206
We got a long ride.
(kids laugh)

2599
01:49:20,208 --> 01:49:21,038
- Mitch.

2600
01:49:21,042 --> 01:49:22,282
- Let's go home.

2601
01:49:22,292 --> 01:49:23,247
Ah!

2602
01:49:23,250 --> 01:49:26,697
(lively orchestral music)

2603
01:50:16,375 --> 01:50:19,993
J‘ Where did my heart 90 J‘

2604
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:23,572
J‘ When did it lose the way I

2605
01:50:23,583 --> 01:50:26,290
J‘ How did I let J‘

2606
01:50:26,292 --> 01:50:31,241
J‘ You slip away J‘

2607
01:50:32,208 --> 01:50:37,157
J‘ Why is it so hard to say J‘

2608
01:50:38,125 --> 01:50:41,697
J‘ Words that might touch you J‘

2609
01:50:41,708 --> 01:50:45,280
J‘ Make you believe that I'm J‘

2610
01:50:45,292 --> 01:50:48,250
I More than it seems I

2611
01:50:48,250 --> 01:50:52,539
J‘ That I am today I

01:50:52,542 --> 01:50:55,909

J‘ All these dreams J‘

2615
01:51:02,917 --> 01:51:06,535
J‘ That I keep inside J‘

2616
01:51:06,542 --> 01:51:11,366
J‘ Now, it's gonna take a while I

2617
01:51:11,375 --> 01:51:15,618
J‘ But I've got to learn to smile J‘

2618
01:51:15,625 --> 01:51:17,581
J‘ Again I

2619
01:51:28,750 --> 01:51:32,288
J‘ Once it was easy J‘

2620
01:51:32,292 --> 01:51:35,910
J‘ I never had to try J‘

2621
01:51:35,917 --> 01:51:38,624
J‘ I never had J‘

2622
01:51:38,625 --> 01:51:43,574
J‘To say a lie J‘

2623
01:51:44,583 --> 01:51:49,532
J‘ Never thought I'd see you cry J‘

2624
01:51:50,292 --> 01:51:53,955
J‘ But now I know better J‘

2625
01:51:53,958 --> 01:51:57,405
J‘ I've got to find a way J‘

2626
01:51:57,417 --> 01:52:02,116
J‘ I don't wanna hear you say J‘

2627
01:52:02,125 --> 01:52:04,912
J‘ Goodbye J‘

2628
01:52:04,917 --> 01:52:08,205
II can run J‘

2629

J‘ That fills your heart with laughter J‘

2637
01:52:37,625 --> 01:52:40,788
J‘ I don't wanna find a way J‘

2638
01:52:40,792 --> 01:52:45,741
I To get along after you I

2639
01:52:47,333 --> 01:52:51,372
J‘ I wanna be the man J‘

2640
