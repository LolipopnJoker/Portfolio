1
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,432
ANGEL:
Almost got hung myself once.

2
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:44,353
Didn't care for it much.

3
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,106
How about you?

4
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,693
We'll leave you now.

5
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:55,030
Don't want anyone to see me here...

6
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:58,534
...get the crazy notion that I was
somehow connected with your...

7
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,285
...accidental death.

8
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,163
On the other hand...

9
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:06,875
...it's not good for a man
to be out here alone.

10
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,211
The mind can do terrible things.

11
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,299
Enjoy the company.

12
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,028
Oh, snakes.

13
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,908
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

14
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:47,291
Don't go without me,
all right, Ollie?

15
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,792
Lord...

16
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,171
...whatever I've done
to piss you off...

17
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,590
...if you'd just
get me out of this...

18
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:58,427
...let me know what it was,
I'll rectify the situation.

19
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,680
BRET: It had just been a shitty week
for me from the beginning.

20
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,017
It all started when I was heading
into Crystal River...

21
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,269
...to take some money
from the bank.

22
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,564
I should've known there was
bad luck on the horizon...

23
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,274
...when my horse got stolen...

24
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:16,445
...and I had to replace it with
something less than a thoroughbred.

25
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,536
My luck had to change fast.

26
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:28,790
The poker game of the century
was four days away in St. Louis...

27
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:32,961
...and I was still $3,000 short
of the entrance fee.

28
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,964
There was no way in hell
I would miss that game.

29
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,218
Not just because there was
a half-million dollar pot to be won...

30
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,387
...although that kind of money
certainly demands attention...

31
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:46,642
...but because I needed to know
how good I really was.

32
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,685
Once and for all.

33
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,745
I had to hole up here
for the night.

34
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,248
Business would have to wait
till morning.

35
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,005
Whoa, big fella.

36
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,591
- Hello, sir.
- Hi, son.

37
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,719
How much?

38
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,262
By the day, week or month?

39
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:52,225
No, no. Not how much to take care of him,
how much to just take him. Permanently.

40
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:55,729
Pa! This man wants to know
if you wanna buy a burro.

41
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,523
MAN:
That burro ain't worth a dollar.

42
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,943
BRET: Well, sir,
I say you got yourself a deal.

43
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,447
Here's your dollar.

44
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:09,618
He doesn't eat much,
but he's a regular jackass.

45
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,164
And he-aw, he-aw, he always likes
to be called Arthur.

46
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:18,835
From the moment I slapped eyes
on this hombre, I smelled trouble...

47
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,046
...and refried beans.

48
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:25,967
Something else told me that this
was not just a chance meeting.

49
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:58,417
WOMAN:
I'll see your 10 and I'll raise you 10.

50
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,339
MAN 1:
I call.

51
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,216
MAN 2: What do you got?
WOMAN: Full house.

52
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,427
MAN 2:
That beats me.

53
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:11,847
MAN 3:
Damn. You are a lucky lady.

54
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,237
Is this seat taken?

55
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,489
It is now.

56
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,868
My name is Annabelle Bransford.

57
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,578
What do they call you?

58
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:37,080
Bret Maverick.
I'm pleased to meet you.

59
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,166
I like the game the way it is.

60
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:43,962
Well, I bring all sorts
of pluses to the table.

61
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:47,507
I hardly ever bluff
and I never, ever cheat.

62
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,719
I don't believe it.

63
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,345
Neither do I.

64
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,890
I like the game just the way it is.

65
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,766
What good is an empty chair?

66
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,560
Indeed.

67
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,687
I'll bet I can change your mind.

68
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:05,108
I promise that I will lose
for at least an hour.

69
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,319
- I like that.
- Sounds good.

70
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,945
MAN:
My kind of player.

71
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,989
We're playing five-card draw.

72
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,532
Please, sit down.

73
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,952
My name is
Mrs. Annabelle Bransford.

74
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,915
I caught that before, ma'am.
Except the "Mrs."

75
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,750
MAN 1:
Ante up.

76
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,251
ANGEL:
I'm in.

77
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:24,920
MAN 1:
Same game. Chips, sir.

78
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,380
MAN 2:
You can lose as much as you want.

79
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,759
BRET:
Two hundred.

80
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:36,306
- You did say you'd lose for an hour.
- I'm a man of my word.

81
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,557
I know.

82
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,316
MAN 1:
Place your bets.

83
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,450
It's about time.

84
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,544
JOHNNY:
I'll see you...

85
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,922
...and raise you 20.

86
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,508
BRET: Slow down,
I'm running low on chips.

87
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,844
I'll see your bet and...

88
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,556
...I'll call.

89
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,308
JOHNNY:
Two pair. Aces over queens.

90
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,977
Lucky for me, I had 3 sixes.

91
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:50,690
Sorry.

92
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,320
MAN:
Nice pot.

93
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,905
Broke your losing streak.

94
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,032
That one shouldn't count.

95
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,034
Beg your pardon?

96
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,161
I don't think
that hand should count.

97
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,790
You got any logical reasons
why not?

98
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,793
My mind wasn't on the game.

99
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,461
His mind wasn't on the...

100
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:15,965
What's your name, son?

101
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:18,718
- Johnny.
- You got a last name?

102
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,470
Johnny Hardin.

103
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,894
What's your occupation?

104
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,229
I'm a gunfighter.

105
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,362
I have to assume
since you're still alive...

106
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,948
...and playing cards with us...

107
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,283
...that you're good at it.

108
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,953
Care to find out?

109
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:52,085
Gentlemen, this hand definitely
does not count. Take it all.

110
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:56,464
Whatever you think's fair, and
I'll be content with the leavings.

111
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,091
You always been gutless?

112
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,556
I think so. For as long
as I can remember, at any rate.

113
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,768
My old pappy used to say,
"He who fights and runs away...

114
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,187
...can run away another day."

115
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,862
What?

116
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,405
Look, I don't see...

117
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,867
Whoa, whoa!

118
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,577
Slow down there.

119
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,079
Where's the fire, son?

120
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:34,002
Slow down. Don't shoot me, okay?
I'm just trying to expound.

121
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,505
I was saying, I don't see
what's so great about being brave.

122
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:40,592
I mean, I'm a card player.
You know, I play cards.

123
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,178
Call me a gambler.
I want to become an old gambler.

124
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,180
You are a gunfighter.

125
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,516
An exceptional one at that,
from what I hear.

126
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:52,562
If I went up against you, what
chance would I have had? Answer?

127
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,689
Zero.

128
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,441
CROWD:
Ooh!

129
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,697
Absolutely none whatsoever.

130
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,326
Wanna see it again?

131
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,625
Damn thing won't stay
in the holster.

132
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,461
Whoop! I must have a spring in there.

133
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,797
Come on, let's just play poker.

134
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,466
Who wants to play poker?

135
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,136
Who wants to see
someone get killed?

136
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:28,389
No. Let's play poker.

137
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,809
I'd rather be rich than dead.

138
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,190
Was that fast?
I thought that was fast.

139
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,400
Was it fast? Was it?

140
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,361
Yeah.

141
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:45,073
Now, what was it? Stud?

142
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,284
I think I prefer draw!

143
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,287
Just kidding.

144
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,123
Sorry. I couldn't resist it.

145
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,836
My ante's in.

146
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,770
- I'll raise you 75.
- Oh, 75.

147
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,274
Well, that's...
That more than takes care of your bet.

148
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:23,444
And I'll raise you whatever that is,
looks like 100.

149
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,827
Shit! I fold.

150
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,624
Hey, you never paid to look...

151
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,501
ANGEL:
You said you never bluffed.

152
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,211
I had a pair of aces!

153
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:44,340
No, I said I never cheated
and I also said I hardly ever bluff.

154
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,134
This is one of the "hardlys."

155
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,511
You've been cheating
the whole game.

156
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:52,140
What do you think I was doing
during that first hour?

157
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,934
I was learning your tells.

158
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:58,313
Your weakness comes
when you get your hand...

159
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,400
...shuffle the cards back and forth
and act a little fidgety.

160
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,194
I just called you a cheat.

161
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:08,323
You also called me gutless...

162
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,284
...but I figured
you were just teasing.

163
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,786
Get your hands off him!

164
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,497
We get him first!

165
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:21,169
When I seen you through the window,
I believed in the Almighty.

166
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,587
BRET:
You were drinking.

167
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:25,590
A lot. And you played bad.
Whose fault is that?

168
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:29,677
Yours, you bastard!
It's all your fault!

169
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,388
It's our time now.

170
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:49,197
- I think there's gonna be a fight.
BRET: Come here, son.

171
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,408
I want you
to hold onto this for me.

172
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,828
If they get to whupping me...

173
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,705
...you have my permission
to shoot me.

174
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,415
BOY: Shoot you?
- Shoot me.

175
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,376
See this gets no dirt on it.
Thank you.

176
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,170
BOY:
Good luck! I get to hold it.

177
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,687
I'm going to cut you up...

178
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:21,896
...fancy man!

179
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,280
BOY: You're a pretty good fighter.
BRET: Thank you.

180
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,699
BOY: I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.
- Me too.

181
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,368
BOY: By the way, I won 20 cents.
- Twenty cents?

182
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,455
Thanks to my lucky shirt.

183
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:21,998
BOY:
Speaking of my 20 cents...

184
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:46,564
All right. All right! My shirt's damaged!
Damn!

185
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,567
What the hell else bad
can happen? You!

186
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:53,029
What did you say before?
You called me something.

187
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,907
- Nothing important.
- He called you a gutless coward.

188
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,285
I did not say that. I might've said
a gutless cheat...

189
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,788
...but not a coward.
- Cheat? Cheat?

190
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,331
I was teasing.

191
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,416
- Teasing?
- Teasing.

192
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,255
I don't like being teased.

193
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,468
Hey. My friend, I'm sorry.

194
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,555
Now I'm teasing you.

195
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,392
Let's play poker.

196
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:28,523
Oh, ma'am. Here. Let me get your chair.

197
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,651
That was truly amazing.

198
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,529
I just get lucky sometimes.

199
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,574
Whose deal was it? Mine?

200
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:42,286
Excuse me. Think I'm through
with y'all for the evening.

201
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,205
- Good night, ma'am.
- Good night.

202
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,749
Good night, son.

203
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,668
Five-card draw all right?

204
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,545
Whatever.

205
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,588
Mind if I take six?

206
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,718
Little poker humor.
I'm just teasing you again.

207
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,617
Who is it?

208
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,161
ANNABELLE:
Annabelle Bransford.

209
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,260
I shouldn't be doing this.

210
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,638
You're just standing
in the hallway.

211
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,932
That's still legal in this state.

212
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:49,270
If only I weren't a married woman.

213
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,284
I couldn't help myself.

214
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:07,121
My very being cried out
to hold you.

215
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,624
Stop by anytime.

216
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,461
I know we may never
see each other again...

217
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:16,088
...so I think it's safe to say...

218
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,341
...you are the most...

219
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:22,470
...blindingly attractive man
that I've ever seen.

220
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,559
Goodbye.

221
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,070
How can I possibly go on...

222
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,655
...without my wallet?

223
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,660
If you don't give back my money,
I'll have your ass in jail.

224
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,161
Damn!

225
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,997
Don't get mad at me. I can't help it
if you're a miserable thief.

226
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:54,335
I'm a very good thief.
I just been having bad luck.

227
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,504
I know what that's all about.

228
00:20:56,797 --> 00:21:00,675
Where're you from?
Your accent could use some work too.

229
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:06,180
- Most gentlemen enjoy my Southern.
- That's not in dispute.

230
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,600
But I'll bet there is
no Mr. Bransford, is there?

231
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:14,313
No, and there never will be,
thank you very much.

232
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:19,860
Now what do we do?
You're not going to turn me in, are you?

233
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:22,613
I am law-abiding.
It's my duty to turn you in.

234
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,032
I'm afraid I'll have to...

235
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:30,579
What the hell. I got my money back
and there's no harm done.

236
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,707
Let's just call it square,
shall we?

237
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:40,798
Damn!

238
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:42,883
What?

239
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:47,471
You're just so irritating
and likable.

240
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,057
I have to work on that, I guess.

241
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,892
There you go, all likable again.

242
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,814
You know, I...

243
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:02,945
I think that had we known each other
under different circumstances...

244
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,239
...we'd have hated each other.

245
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,580
There's no Mrs. Maverick?

246
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,458
I'm sure I would've remembered.

247
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,337
May I?

248
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,780
I wish we'd never met.

249
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:50,951
Goodbye.

250
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,760
Ow!

251
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:17,853
She did it.

252
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,315
Son of a bitch.

253
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:31,909
BRET:
Can I be of some help?

254
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:35,830
What?

255
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,833
You have to admit
I was much better the second time.

256
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,293
Not just better.
You were good.

257
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,421
- I was?
- Very good.

258
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,131
Thank you.

259
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:49,468
And now
it's time you do something I want.

260
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:53,013
How dare you? I'm a lady.
Not in a million years!

261
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,850
Not if you or I were 100 years old...

262
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,227
Shut up! I don't want
to go to bed with you.

263
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,062
Why not?

264
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:03,524
Why not?
I'd be too frightened!

265
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,527
If I dozed, God knows
what parts of me you'd steal.

266
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,072
I'd wake up
with all sorts of things missing.

267
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,159
But I don't know
how to clean this...

268
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,578
...and, obviously,
you must know how to.

269
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:18,706
The laundry's closed,
I leave early and you owe me.

270
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,207
Easy on the starch.

271
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:27,631
If I can't touch you,
I can touch your shirt and dream.

272
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,925
BRET: Want a hand?
ANNABELLE: Yes, thank you.

273
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,396
BRET:
Thank you.

274
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,190
Good night, Bert.

275
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,941
Bret.

276
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:48,402
Bret. That's my name.
Bret.

277
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,647
BRET: Good morning.
ROBERT: Morning.

278
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,400
BRET: Is Eugene in?
ROBERT: Yes, sir, but he's bus...

279
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,119
Eugene?

280
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,747
Get up,
you bald-headed reprobate!

281
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,123
- On your feet!
- Don't shoot.

282
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:46,418
- I need some cash.
EUGENE: I know a desert flower...

283
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:47,962
Shut up!

284
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:49,922
- Put the cash on the table.
EUGENE: I don't have any.

285
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,215
ROBERT:
Robbery!

286
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:55,970
EUGENE: Robert, no!
It's all right.

287
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:58,556
It's my friend Bret saying hello.

288
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,600
- Tell everybody everything's okay.
ROBERT: Yes, sir.

289
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:04,562
EUGENE: Son of a bitch.
BRET: Silly bastard.

290
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:08,524
- How are things going?
- Things couldn't be worse.

291
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,526
I know I owe you $1,000.

292
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,529
- That's what I came for.
- Would you take 100?

293
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:17,491
I've never welshed on a debt.
Give me to year's end.

294
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,288
The end of the?
I need that money right now.

295
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:23,664
Oh, for the?

296
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,791
For the poker championship,
the All Rivers.

297
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,459
How much to enter?

298
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,504
Twenty-five thousand dollars.

299
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:33,507
I'm $3,000 short,
but with Joseph and you...

300
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,175
Pork Chop Slim owed me...

301
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:38,012
...but his widow used the money
for his funeral.

302
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:40,139
They never found the body.

303
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:43,017
- What?
- They never found his body.

304
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,353
The widow Pork Chop conned me.

305
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,856
What's with people nowadays?

306
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:53,277
I know. You can't trust them.
Take my last 100.

307
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,405
I can't.
What about Matilda and the kid?

308
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,993
- Bank robbery!
- I told you...

309
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,828
ROBBER 1: You heard him!
Bank robbery!

310
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:06,707
I'll take this, gunslinger.

311
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:09,376
Empty your pockets, old man.

312
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,670
I got a silver dollar.

313
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,256
ROBBER 1: Do better!
My trigger finger's itchy.

314
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:17,343
All right, don't shoot, don't shoot.

315
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,930
EUGENE: Take it.
ROBBER 1: What? Look at this.

316
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:24,475
Well, I'll be. Jesus.

317
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,728
BRET:
Hundreds and thousands.

318
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,356
- You said you were broke!
- I am now! He's got it.

319
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:33,525
ROBBER 1: And I'll get the rest too!
- I don't have any more.

320
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:37,071
ROBBER 1: Pull those pockets out.
Turn around!

321
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:39,448
- Hurry up! Hey!
BRET: I'm sorry.

322
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:42,910
ROBBER 1:
Give me that!

323
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:51,585
ROBBER 1: Nah.
BRET: Nah.

324
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:54,171
ROBBER 1:
Let's blow the safe!

325
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:57,424
- Light up!
ROBBER 2: Heads down, everybody!

326
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:04,181
BRET: I'm younger than you.
EUGENE: I should be under...

327
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,190
ROBBER 1: Ugh.
I'm getting too old for this shit.

328
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,445
Hi-yah! Yah!

329
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:27,955
EUGENE: You sons of bitches
beat me by a day!

330
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,291
BRET:
Eugene!

331
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,293
You're holding out.

332
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:36,714
Bret, that's all I got left!

333
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:39,925
EUGENE:
Maverick!

334
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:44,138
THUG:
Hey!

335
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:46,473
Bret Maverick!

336
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,934
MAN:
Nothing to worry about.

337
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,979
THUG:
We want to talk to you, pal.

338
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:55,023
Where are you going?

339
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,359
Got you now!

340
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,488
BRET: Anybody see you?
THUG: Not a soul.

341
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:04,283
You fellas come in any later last night...

342
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,160
...that monster would've eaten me alive.

343
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,787
We saw that.
Anybody suspect anything?

344
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,998
Not a thing. You were great!

345
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,833
We enjoyed it.

346
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,501
No kidding.

347
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:16,170
Thanks for taking it easy on us.

348
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:19,715
Easy?
Those were my best shots.

349
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,760
The one there rung my bell a little bit.

350
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,511
That's good.

351
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,013
You owe us $5 apiece.

352
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:29,558
- Five bucks.
- Damn right, $5 a beating.

353
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:34,313
You boys may or
may not believe this.

354
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:38,400
They cleaned the bank and me out.
I'll have to owe you.

355
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,486
Are you saying...

356
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:44,490
...you don't have our money
for taking your best shots?

357
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:48,619
BRET: Killing me won't make you richer.
- Sure gonna make me feel better.

358
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,872
You got a point there.

359
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,791
Let's see here.

360
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,920
I'm sorry. I forgot!

361
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,546
I honestly forgot.

362
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,007
I always keep something pinned
inside my vest...

363
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,051
...for such a rainy day occasion.

364
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:07,054
It's a good thing.
It was clouding up pretty quick.

365
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,141
BRET:
That's a $100 bill.

366
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:16,104
THUG: A $100 bill?
BRET: But I do need some change.

367
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:20,567
BRET: Eighty will be close enough, 75...
THUG: Let's see what we got.

368
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:25,197
- I got 17 here.
- Seventeen dollars?

369
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,366
- That's right.
- You owe me $8 for a month.

370
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:30,536
- We'll settle that later.
- You always cheat me.

371
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:32,579
- I can't believe you!
BRET: Close enough.

372
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:36,750
You came out better
than you think. Nice working with you.

373
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,378
You keep this
under your hats, okay?

374
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:41,338
News travels fast in the old West.

375
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:45,342
A $100 bill! That's...

376
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:48,470
...25 apiece.

377
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:11,034
BRET: Ever since I was a kid,
I believed I had a gift.

378
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:14,162
That if I thought hard enough
about a card...

379
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:16,999
...I'd be able
to cut straight to it.

380
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,671
My old pappy always said
I was a damn fool.

381
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:27,467
But I knew if I really believed
and made it happen, then that...

382
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:30,929
...would be
nothing short of magic.

383
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,435
Damn!

384
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,978
Of course, it didn't always work.

385
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,396
What do I expect?

386
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,275
In fact, it had never worked.

387
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,953
You sweet woman.

388
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,669
Lucky shirt. Yes.

389
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:16,350
Mrs. Bransford. Mrs. Bransford!

390
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,853
Wait! You!

391
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:23,774
Wait there. I'm... No! You...
Wait!

392
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,412
BRET: Hold up the ferry!
Don't go without me!

393
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,384
You did this on purpose.

394
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,469
You bet I did.

395
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,304
This is my lucky shirt.

396
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,556
Do your own laundry then.

397
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,476
My underwear comes from New York.

398
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,229
Got any idea
where this shirt was made?

399
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,982
Paris, France, that's where!

400
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:08,360
I can't go to the nearest dry goods store
to pick up another one!

401
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:11,905
Why don't you try
the kiddie department?

402
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,282
Remove your hands from the lady.

403
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:20,122
When you least expect it,
your hero arrives. Mister?

404
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:23,125
Zane Cooper.
Folks call me Coop.

405
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,252
- Suits me just fine.
- Coop.

406
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:28,714
This creature's named Maverick.
I'm Annabelle Bransford.

407
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:32,050
- I'll be taking this coach.
COOP & BRET: So am I.

408
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,011
BRET:
That ought to be fun.

409
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:38,390
Lord knows what that ruffian might've done
had we been alone on the stage for two days.

410
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:41,935
I hope you can relax
and enjoy the journey now.

411
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:46,273
My feeling is that
if there weren't any women...

412
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,400
...none of us would be here.

413
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:51,945
What kind of sense does that make?

414
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:54,781
If there were no men,
we wouldn't be here either.

415
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,533
Are you mocking me?

416
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,619
Don't get ruffled.
I was agreeing with you...

417
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:02,122
...in a totally unusual way.

418
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:06,585
What would this world come to
without gentlemen like yourself?

419
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:12,299
BRET: A passenger!
Come ahead.

420
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,802
Right this way, sir. Want a hand?

421
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,806
I'm the driver.

422
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,601
Are you all right?

423
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,936
Why does everybody ask me that?

424
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:28,398
Get me up there so
we can get this thing going.

425
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:49,669
I think it's about time
we get to know each other.

426
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:53,131
Mr. Maverick has aspirations
to be a card player.

427
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:56,885
I'm not ignorant of cards.
Can't be in my line of work.

428
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,888
- And pray, what might that be?
- Lawman.

429
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:04,643
I bet you're the best there is.
I can tell things about a man.

430
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:08,814
I can't quite place your accent.
Where in the South are you from?

431
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:11,358
Ever been to Mobile?

432
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:13,401
That's where I'm from.

433
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:15,987
Mobile, Alabama?
Hell, I been there.

434
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:19,074
I'll bet we know the same people.
You start.

435
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,452
I've tried so hard
to forget that place.

436
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,996
I endured
such personal tragedy there.

437
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:31,169
A woman's suffering
is not a funny thing, Bertie.

438
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,421
There are exceptions.

439
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:37,175
Watch your billfold.

440
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,398
BRET:
Hey, old-timer!

441
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:55,068
The thief and the old guy
find it bumpy back here!

442
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:33,565
How could you face them all down?
Nine men, all of them armed?

443
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:38,111
A man gives his word to do his job,
he's honor bound to do it.

444
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,113
- Weren't you afraid?
- A mite.

445
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,700
Maverick doesn't believe in bravery.

446
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:47,120
I think bravery's a fine thing...

447
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:51,124
...just overrated is all,
and doesn't suit me personally.

448
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,294
- I just realized something.
- What's that?

449
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:56,379
You're spineless.

450
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,799
That's right.
It's kept me alive a long time.

451
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:17,275
ANGEL:
You fellas got a problem?

452
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,152
Heavens to Betsy, no!

453
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,739
What's the joke?

454
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,742
JOHN: You, Pancho. You're the joke.
- Explain that.

455
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,828
You'll have to pay us
more money than Maverick did.

456
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:34,918
He paid you to fall down?

457
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,795
Paid us good too.

458
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:39,339
That's right. A $100 bill.

459
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,342
- That's a good day's work.
MAN: That's right.

460
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,762
You fellas ought to see me first.

461
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,640
I'd have let you fall down for free.

462
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:11,663
Maverick is mine, anyway.

463
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,665
But this time it's personal.

464
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,845
Hundred dollar bill. Ha!

465
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,696
Is he taking a short cut?

466
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:58,376
Hey, old-timer, wake up!
Wake...

467
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:06,217
- Is he asleep?
- It's more serious than that.

468
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:08,094
- He's dead.
- Dead?

469
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,763
Yeah.

470
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:13,641
- Get up and stop the stage.
- Me? I just put a fresh shirt on.

471
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:16,478
- You stop the stage!
- Because this wheel's loose.

472
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:19,731
If it comes off, we're all dead.
Stop the stage.

473
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,359
- I'll take care of the wheel.
BRET: All right.

474
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:26,446
- Give me your hat.
- It better fit when I come back.

475
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:42,879
Now, Bert, stop playing around
and stop those horses.

476
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,006
BRET: Help!
- This is serious!

477
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:58,686
- He'll be fine. He looks handy.
- He is?

478
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:14,035
- Why don't you fix the wheel?
- The wheel is perfect.

479
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:17,455
Then help him.
He'll kill you when he gets back.

480
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:20,542
No, in the long run,
he'll thank me in his prayers.

481
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,432
Ow!

482
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:38,184
What's he doing back there?

483
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,424
BRET:
Sorry!

484
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:13,887
COOP: Stop fooling around!
BRET: You poked me in the eye!

485
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:16,556
COOP:
Get up there and stop the horses!

486
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:19,726
BRET:
Whoa, horses! Stop!

487
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,537
Whoa! Stop!

488
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,311
Whoa!

489
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,111
Ow.

490
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,624
COOP: Let me help you.
BRET: I got it.

491
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:30,171
COOP:
Here.

492
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:35,552
So, what's with the wheel?

493
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:39,472
- Oh! It's fine.
- Nothing was wrong with it. It...

494
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:42,308
I know. I got a real good...

495
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:45,061
...close look at the wheels
from underneath.

496
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:48,273
Don't you feel better
about yourself for being so brave?

497
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:51,651
- Wasn't that exciting?
BRET: Ha-ha. I get it.

498
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:54,153
This was all for my benefit.

499
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,656
- Yes!
BRET: To help me build character.

500
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:59,158
- Exactly.
- He's bursting with pride.

501
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:03,288
That's funny.
You'd think I'd be mad, wouldn't you?

502
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:06,916
Give me your hand.

503
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:12,171
Don't you ever try
and help me again.

504
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,091
You either.

505
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:18,386
Now back off.
Go ahead, back off!

506
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,096
Go away.

507
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,016
ANNABELLE:
Ungrateful.

508
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:40,658
Help.

509
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:42,869
COOP :
What?

510
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:47,999
BRET:
Help.

511
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:55,882
What did you say?

512
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,343
Please help me.

513
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:01,262
Oh! Okay, take my hand.

514
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,640
You take my hand.

515
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:13,900
Take my other hand.

516
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:18,029
- Easy.
- Oh, watch the cactus!

517
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:21,574
I don't care about it.
Just get me up there.

518
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:23,368
COOP:
You're doing good.

519
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:29,749
Now get your hands off me!

520
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:36,297
Ungrateful.

521
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:49,268
COOP: Somebody ought to say
something nice about the deceased.

522
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:52,230
How do we know he was nice?
We don't know anything about him.

523
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:55,942
The only thing in his wallet
is names of whorehouses.

524
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:03,866
BRET :
Amazing grace

525
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:08,621
ALL :
How sweet the sound

526
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:13,626
That saved a wretch

527
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:16,713
Like me

528
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:39,652
ANGEL:
"Don't let Maverick reach the game."

529
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:55,752
COOP:
Trouble.

530
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,846
BRET:
Pull up! Whoa!

531
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:25,031
MARGARET: We sing praises
unto the Lord, our God!

532
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:38,377
BRET:
Here.

533
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:42,215
COOP:
We'll do everything we can.

534
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:44,842
Though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

535
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,886
COOP:
Maverick!

536
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:50,181
- They got hit by Indians.
- Yeah, they were Injuns.

537
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,642
Ma'am, it was not Indians.

538
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:55,728
I seen them.
They were wearing war paint...

539
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,188
If it was Indians...

540
00:46:57,356 --> 00:47:00,191
COOP: I said we'd take them
to Cristal City.

541
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:02,819
- That's backtracking.
- Just a day.

542
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:06,906
- I have a game to get to.
- I know what you have to get to.

543
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:10,034
- Took my girl's music box.
- My favorite!

544
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:12,078
And the wagon with our money.

545
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:15,915
Hold it. Simmer down. Simmer down.

546
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:17,750
Exactly how much money?

547
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,585
- What kind of animal are you?
- Vulture.

548
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:21,504
Exactly how much money?

549
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,047
Thirty thousand dollars.

550
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:25,883
We were starting a mission.

551
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:29,887
If I get it back,
is it worth 10 percent to you?

552
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:32,473
Five. Five percent.

553
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:37,061
No, 10 percent, Mary Margaret.
I want my wedding dress back...

554
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:39,105
...for when I find a husband.

555
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,441
All right. Can you do it?

556
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:46,946
- I know we can.
BRET: What's this "we" stuff? Ma'am.

557
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:51,659
I'll give you 10 percent,
but make those savages suffer.

558
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:55,746
I'm telling you, there are
no hostile Indians around here.

559
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:03,504
Oh, my God! Come on...

560
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:06,757
COOP: Drums.
Those are definitely drums.

561
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:09,385
Right again, Bert.

562
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:12,513
It's Bret.

563
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:14,515
Hm.

564
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:27,612
ANNABELLE: Well?
- They may look like dimples in dirt to you.

565
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:32,825
But they're shod horse tracks. Indians don't
shoe their ponies. So it wasn't Indians.

566
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:35,995
They're Indians.
They probably stole the ponies.

567
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:39,498
- Not everybody's like you.
- What is it with you and Indians?

568
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:44,670
Nothing. I try to shoot one a day. If possible,
before noon. How about you, Coop?

569
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:49,634
It's their fault for being
on our land before we got here.

570
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,515
- What are you doing here?
ANNABELLE: We're partners. 50-50.

571
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:59,310
Sounds like 50-50 to me.

572
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:01,729
You want 50% too?

573
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,023
I want those ladies
to get their money.

574
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:08,194
BRET: Oh, fine!
I don't split my bounty with anybody.

575
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,446
ANNABELLE:
Would 60-40 be agreeable?

576
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:14,533
BRET: What'll you do for your 40 percent?
ANNABELLE: I'll help.

577
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,456
BRET:
Oh.

578
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:29,006
Seventy-thirty?

579
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:34,053
Now, Mrs. Bransford, 70-30,
I don't know.

580
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:37,223
You're not exactly
an experienced tracker.

581
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:43,270
Some tracker you are,
following horses. Anybody can do that.

582
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:44,897
Anybody? Oh...

583
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:46,482
...you see that hawk?

584
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:49,610
ANNABELLE: No!
- I won't shoot the hawk.

585
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:53,364
- You know what that hawk means?
ANNABELLE: What?

586
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:55,741
Nothing. But you didn't know that.

587
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,576
- I did!
- You didn't.

588
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:59,745
- Children!
BRET: Shh!

589
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:04,083
What?
Smell some Indians in Montana?

590
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:07,920
No. Now be quiet.

591
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,505
What is it?

592
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:18,097
- What do you hear?
- Huh? Nothing.

593
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:23,561
I thought I'd nap before sundown.
Sneak up on them in the dark.

594
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:30,109
What are you laughing at?

595
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,205
BRET :
Here you go.

596
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:45,708
COOP : There's 6 horses.
It's got to be them.

597
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,669
BRET: You got good eyes.
COOP: We got to tie these up.

598
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:52,173
ANNABELLE : Can you
teach me to be a better poker player?

599
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:55,342
BRET: What? Now?
ANNABELLE: You might be dead later.

600
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:58,637
You're all heart.
Poker's about observing.

601
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:01,974
Observe the U.S. Cavalry brand
and the shoes.

602
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:04,560
They're not Indian.
These are tells.

603
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:06,103
- You got tells too.
- Do not.

604
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:09,065
- You play with your hair at cards.
- I never...

605
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:12,276
Would you two shut up?
Just listen!

606
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:17,198
Sounds like a music box,
doesn't it?

607
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:23,287
Oh, hey. There they are.

608
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:27,958
There's the music box she talked about.

609
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:30,669
And look at that fella in the back.

610
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:33,339
He's wearing your sweetheart's
wedding dress, Mary Margaret.

611
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:36,092
Margaret Mary. She's not...

612
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:38,177
You're on a first-name basis.

613
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,346
Would you two be quiet!

614
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,306
Be quiet!

615
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:44,058
You're crazy.

616
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:47,186
Did you see any money over there?

617
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:49,814
BRET:
No.

618
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:51,524
Can't see anything.

619
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:54,860
We could take them easy.
They're half drunk...

620
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:58,823
That's a strange new word in your
vocabulary, "we." This is your show.

621
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:02,743
You'd just stand there
and let me face six guys with six guns?

622
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:03,953
Yeah.

623
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:07,623
I have one gun, that's six bullets.
They got six guns, that's 36 bullets.

624
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:11,544
What if they got 2? That's 72 bullets.
Maybe they got rifles.

625
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:14,839
Shut up. You're babbling.

626
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:16,173
You're babbling.

627
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:18,884
- No, I wasn't.
ANNABELLE: You are babbling.

628
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,053
Don't worry,
they're probably drunk.

629
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:24,557
Coop faced nine men dead sober,
didn't you?

630
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:26,225
BRET:
He's always dead sober.

631
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:28,394
COOP: She didn't mean that.
- That's what she said.

632
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:30,187
I said the outlaws were sober!

633
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,231
BRET & COOP:
Shh!

634
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:35,359
BRET :
Shut up!

635
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,283
ANNABELLE:
Here he comes.

636
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:04,180
What if there's trouble? Seriously.

637
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:07,892
- I'm right behind you.
BRET: You are?

638
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:09,935
No "wheels coming off" shit.

639
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:13,272
That was broken bones.
This is dying.

640
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:14,940
Other way.

641
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:16,984
Dying. Right.

642
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:19,653
- Give it to me.
- What?

643
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:21,947
It may be my last chance.
Hand it over.

644
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,909
- How dare you?
- I need all I can get.

645
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:28,245
- No, just take your own.
- Got to be under there.

646
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:30,956
- All right, 50 percent.
- Fifty percent?

647
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,750
- No!
- Fifty-fifty.

648
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:36,003
- No.
- Sixty-forty. Sixty-forty.

649
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:38,422
BRET: Sixty-forty.
- All right, 60-40.

650
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:43,469
You're the fastest draw.
Why do you need my tiny gun?

651
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,887
Who said that?

652
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:47,264
It's true. I am fast, but...

653
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:52,144
...I can't hit shit, especially when
I aim at people, so I need bullets.

654
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:54,230
- You back me up?
COOP: Yeah.

655
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:57,274
- Bert.
- Bret. My name is Bret.

656
00:53:57,484 --> 00:54:00,986
You're Annabelle, he's Coop.
It's like you're shooting me.

657
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:03,656
Be careful, okay?

658
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:06,492
Of course. You too.

659
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:37,648
BRET:
Hey, everyone.

660
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:41,318
Wake up!
No need to get alarmed.

661
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:44,655
I saw your fire and thought
I'd come visit for a while.

662
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:46,532
Who are you?

663
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,866
Bert Maverick.

664
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:54,498
No. I'm Bret Maverick, and I'm here
to say each one of you has a gun...

665
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,208
...pointed at your heads.

666
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:01,547
Just whistle, so they can hear you.

667
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:02,881
You're surrounded.

668
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:13,100
BRET: Did another wheel come off?
Clap if you can't whistle!

669
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,731
BRET:
See? They're out there.

670
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:22,443
Marshal Zane Cooper will blow
your brains out. Probably heard of him.

671
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:26,530
I know you're thinking he's old, decrepit,
gums his food and his women.

672
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:28,407
But he can still shoot straight.

673
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,784
After you is Ugly Annie Bransford.

674
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:34,371
When she was born, she came out
backwards and no one noticed.

675
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:38,751
Her parents had to tie a pork chop
to her so the dog would play with her.

676
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:42,629
When making love, she has to pretend
she's somebody else.

677
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:47,551
You're all right, Bart.

678
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:49,470
Admit it. That was funny.

679
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:51,263
I didn't think so.

680
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:54,266
Well, some Indians
attacked a wagon train.

681
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:58,270
They said it might be whites acting
like Indians, but I don't believe it.

682
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,733
If you come along with me, we'll settle
this matter. We can all get some more sleep.

683
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:05,361
So if you just follow me.
Get up.

684
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:09,698
Get up. Get in a straight line and let's go.
Come on.

685
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:11,575
I'll give you something to remember!

686
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:22,795
- Aren't you helping him?
- A man could get killed like that.

687
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:34,390
Did you just help him?

688
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:41,814
THIEF 1:
Shot my whiskey bottle!

689
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:49,488
THIEF 2:
Ow! My hand!

690
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,115
Oh, that's my gun!

691
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:55,494
THIEF 3:
Damn you!

692
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:02,209
Oh, isn't he wonderful?

693
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:03,544
Oh, yeah.

694
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:07,506
ANNABELLE:
Look at that!

695
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:10,175
They're all gone.
Isn't it wonderful?

696
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:13,011
- It's wonderful. I'll be rich!
BRET: It was nothing, really.

697
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:18,559
COOP: I'll tell you what you did wrong.
ANNABELLE: Now where's the money?

698
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:21,019
You tell me where it is.

699
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,563
There it is!

700
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:27,860
I've never seen
such beautiful money!

701
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:30,529
- Take off that dress!
ANNABELLE: How dare you!

702
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:32,865
- Not you. Him.
BRET: Put that cash down!

703
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:35,701
- I found it!
BRET: I nearly got blown away!

704
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:38,537
COOP: I'll take the money.
ANNABELLE: I'll count it for you.

705
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:40,205
BRET:
Don't let her touch it!

706
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:43,709
COOP: Where are you going?
Stay and clean up your mess.

707
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,378
Be mature.
Clean up this mess.

708
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:49,548
Get back!
Put those guns down and line up.

709
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:52,384
Don't let her get
within 10 yards of that cash!

710
00:57:56,890 --> 00:58:00,726
MARGARET: I have found you.
For He said, "Seek and ye shall find."

711
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:05,397
And I have found you. Oh, rejoice!

712
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:10,903
Bless you for finding my wedding dress.
Now I can get married.

713
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:14,031
The Lord says it's good
to bear children. The Lord says...

714
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,074
COOP: It's a beautiful dress.
MARGARET: Thank you.

715
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:17,701
COOP:
I'm sure you'll find a husband.

716
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,578
Two thousand five hundred...

717
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:22,080
...$2,600...

718
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:23,499
...$2,800...

719
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:25,125
Two thousand seven hundred,
ma'am.

720
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:27,085
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

721
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:28,629
She'd know.

722
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:33,509
MARY: Two thousand seven hundred,
2,800...

723
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:35,052
...900.

724
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:41,808
Three thousand dollars.
Here you go, the 10 percent we promised.

725
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:48,440
That leaves us
with $27,000, Margaret Mary.

726
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:50,901
That's not enough to start a mission.

727
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:54,279
MARY: Don't worry. We are honorable
women. We promised Mr. Maverick...

728
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:58,784
...$3,000 and we delivered.
The Lord will provide for us.

729
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:18,804
My pappy used to say:

730
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:24,476
"Never sneeze when you hide
or smile when you lie.

731
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:26,478
And never,
under any circumstances...

732
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:30,774
...take money from women who've lost
a dog, a wedding dress and a wagon."

733
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:32,943
Hallelujah!

734
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:34,820
I lost a wedding dress! Bret!

735
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:42,494
MARY: We have got
our money back. Saint Maverick!

736
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:45,205
You owe me my 30 percent.

737
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:50,002
I'm a man of my word.
You can have 30 percent of whatever I got.

738
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:56,091
I hate to interrupt,
but I got a problem.

739
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:59,011
If those renegades
weren't real Indians...

740
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:01,471
...who was beating those drums?

741
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:03,140
Maybe it was them.

742
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:24,995
I'll take care of this.

743
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:36,673
Anybody get that?

744
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:39,926
You know about Indians.
Can you speak to him?

745
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:42,220
BRET:
I'll do my best.

746
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:02,908
What's he say?

747
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:07,579
It seems
we've committed a terrible sin.

748
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:09,873
We're on sacred ground.

749
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:13,293
We didn't know that.
Can't you tell him?

750
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,087
BRET:
Yeah.

751
01:01:29,977 --> 01:01:31,770
His gods demand a sacrifice.

752
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:34,439
There's no other way.
Sacred ground is sacred ground.

753
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:36,066
Sacrifice?

754
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:38,402
Human.

755
01:01:57,130 --> 01:02:01,091
We can go if one of us
passes a bravery test...

756
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:02,634
...but one of us
must go with him.

757
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:04,720
What's the bravery test?

758
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:10,934
He cuts off your hands.
If you don't make a sound, you pass.

759
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:47,679
I'll die before I let him touch you.

760
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:49,848
There's too many of them.
You can't protect me.

761
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:53,518
You're right. Don't show fear.
It makes them crazy.

762
01:02:56,522 --> 01:02:59,024
One of us must go,
or there'll be bloodshed.

763
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:00,942
- I'll go.
- No, I'll go.

764
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:04,780
I owe you.
I almost got you killed twice.

765
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:09,367
I can't do what you can.
You get these people to safety.

766
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:12,829
I'll go, but it's okay.
Third time lucky.

767
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:16,374
Oh, Bret.

768
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:21,004
I liked it just now
when you called me Bret.

769
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:24,508
- One thing.
- What, Bret?

770
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:28,678
When you bluff, never tap
your fingernails on your teeth.

771
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:31,181
That's your second giveaway.
You gotta work on that.

772
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:35,560
Even at a time like this,
you think of others.

773
01:03:55,206 --> 01:03:57,207
Goodbye, my lady.

774
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:04,214
BRET:
You were right, Coop.

775
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:07,342
I never felt better
than I do right now.

776
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:10,220
Take care of yourself.

777
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:13,139
Now when they...

778
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:16,434
...heh-heh, cut my hands off,
my lucky shirt'll fit.

779
01:04:19,772 --> 01:04:22,232
- Bye.
- Bye, Bret.

780
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:33,451
JOE : What was
that about? My throat's killing me.

781
01:04:33,786 --> 01:04:35,912
BRET : Tell you later.
JOE: Tell me later.

782
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,581
Bye.

783
01:04:37,748 --> 01:04:40,292
BRET:
I could die happy right now.

784
01:05:05,526 --> 01:05:08,612
BRET: I'm just trying to...
Will you slow down?

785
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:12,741
I can't get my... Where'd you get
this useless piece of junk?

786
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:16,661
JOE: I won it off a Russian guy in
a card game. Okay, okay. Watch out!

787
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:18,788
My bicycle. Look at that.

788
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:21,541
I'll stick with a horse.

789
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:23,960
What are they laughing at?

790
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:25,670
Nobody's ever ridden it before.

791
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:31,343
BRET:
You sure do pick the spots.

792
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:33,511
Yeah, I know.

793
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:36,765
Next time you people drive us off,
I'll find...

794
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:39,935
...some swampland so awful
you'll leave us alone.

795
01:06:05,002 --> 01:06:07,087
- Is that good?
JOE: Nah.

796
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:14,886
BRET: What's with the drums
and war paint and horses?

797
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:17,472
We had a lousy year.

798
01:06:17,723 --> 01:06:22,060
Not much left to hunt. So when this
Russian archduke, where I got the bike...

799
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:25,981
...came and wanted to see
the real West, I said, "Okay."

800
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:27,357
He pays well.

801
01:06:29,276 --> 01:06:33,363
We get dressed up in war paint
and whoop around like idiots.

802
01:06:33,572 --> 01:06:37,283
He wants me to speak like
they say in books, "How, white man."

803
01:06:37,576 --> 01:06:40,203
You people are such assholes.

804
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:43,540
And he's got to hear
the war drums all the time!

805
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:44,874
Gets on my nerves.

806
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:48,753
You'll move on, you'll have
the cash. What's eating you?

807
01:06:49,588 --> 01:06:52,424
- Uh, Bret.
BRET: What?

808
01:06:52,633 --> 01:06:54,884
I don't have the $1,000 I owe you.

809
01:06:55,052 --> 01:06:57,387
Oh, I knew you'd say that.

810
01:06:57,555 --> 01:07:01,433
I'm sorry. You'll get it as soon
as I change my rubles into dollars.

811
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:04,769
When will that be? I've got
a few days to make it to that big game.

812
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:09,482
Oh, the big game, the big game. You need
$25,000 to get into that. You're crazy.

813
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:14,779
I know that.
I suppose I have to win the $3,000.

814
01:07:15,072 --> 01:07:17,782
If I get your $1,000 in time,
I'll only have to win $2,000.

815
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:19,701
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.
- What?

816
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:23,913
You've got $22,000?

817
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:26,791
Cash?

818
01:07:26,959 --> 01:07:28,293
It's not frog skins.

819
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:31,921
I've never seen $22,000.

820
01:07:32,089 --> 01:07:34,966
I've never seen 25.
This is terrible!

821
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:37,052
Where is it? Can I see it?

822
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:38,970
Why not?

823
01:07:39,138 --> 01:07:41,097
- Can I touch it?
- You can roll in it.

824
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:43,933
JOE: Where is it?
- Where else?

825
01:07:45,936 --> 01:07:47,937
What is this stuff?

826
01:07:50,649 --> 01:07:53,526
- Oh, ha, ha, ha. Very funny.
- What?

827
01:07:55,696 --> 01:07:58,281
It's... It's newspaper.

828
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:06,081
JOE: You all right? Was it the food?
BRET: No, no, no!

829
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:08,583
I'm gonna kill her.
I'm gonna kill her. Annabelle.

830
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:10,376
- What?
- Annabelle.

831
01:08:10,544 --> 01:08:14,297
How could she rob me of $22,000
when I was off to face my doom?

832
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:16,674
You were gonna cut my hands off,
she robbed me anyway!

833
01:08:16,842 --> 01:08:18,510
- What are you talking about?
- No decency!

834
01:08:18,677 --> 01:08:23,098
Pull yourself together!
Everyone's looking.

835
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:26,726
I got your money.
I wanted to see how you'd react.

836
01:08:27,019 --> 01:08:28,686
I was just teasing you.

837
01:08:34,151 --> 01:08:37,320
Teasing? I don't like being teased.

838
01:08:37,488 --> 01:08:39,614
I'll kill you.
You'll be dead, I'll be happy.

839
01:08:39,865 --> 01:08:41,199
JOE: Wait!
- What?

840
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:43,368
JOE: Did you say dead?
- Yes.

841
01:08:45,496 --> 01:08:47,247
I just got an idea.

842
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,949
JOE :
Big asshole.

843
01:09:37,089 --> 01:09:38,631
JOE:
How, white man!

844
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:41,759
Hello, noble savage.
I've had a terrible day.

845
01:09:42,052 --> 01:09:45,597
I kill every animal in sight
and it's boring me.

846
01:09:45,806 --> 01:09:47,056
JOE:
Boring?

847
01:09:47,224 --> 01:09:53,438
Maybe His Largeness be interested
in greatest Western thrill of all.

848
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:55,523
What is it? What?

849
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:57,442
Come, come!

850
01:10:07,786 --> 01:10:10,622
What is greatest Western thrill?

851
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:14,083
Kill Injun.

852
01:10:14,251 --> 01:10:15,960
- Kill...?
JOE: Shh!

853
01:10:16,128 --> 01:10:17,420
Is it legal?

854
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:22,342
White man been doing it for years,
but much wampum needed.

855
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:25,637
How much?

856
01:10:25,804 --> 01:10:29,015
Uh... One thousand.

857
01:10:29,433 --> 01:10:30,975
ARCHDUKE:
One thousand?

858
01:10:31,143 --> 01:10:34,020
Don't tie him.
That wouldn't be sporting.

859
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:37,523
No, he'll lose, but easy hit.
Dying anyway.

860
01:10:37,691 --> 01:10:39,734
Smoke too much tobacco.

861
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,071
Very sick. Put out of misery.
Deal?

862
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:44,948
Deal.

863
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:49,994
JOE: Me go find
and give him courage.

864
01:10:50,162 --> 01:10:53,498
Indian law say death private thing.
You wait here.

865
01:11:00,005 --> 01:11:01,839
BRET:
Psst! Hey!

866
01:11:02,841 --> 01:11:06,135
JOE: Bret?
- Who else? Did you fix his gun?

867
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:08,304
JOE: I couldn't.
He wouldn't let go of it.

868
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:10,807
Great
What's in it for me if I die?

869
01:11:11,016 --> 01:11:13,851
I got him up to $500.

870
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:17,105
Five hundred? Worth the risk.
Let's get it over with.

871
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:18,856
Two-fifty a piece.

872
01:11:19,024 --> 01:11:22,026
I'm the one taking all the risk.
Why do you need $250?

873
01:11:22,194 --> 01:11:23,778
JOE:
Shh!

874
01:11:24,029 --> 01:11:25,863
So, Arch!

875
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:27,699
Look sick.

876
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:32,954
ARCHDUKE:
Tell him to run.

877
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:34,998
No, no, no. Wrong!

878
01:11:35,207 --> 01:11:37,709
What's wrong?
I don't want to lose the light.

879
01:11:37,876 --> 01:11:42,839
Injun shot by white man's weapon
not reach Happy Hunting Ground.

880
01:11:43,048 --> 01:11:45,717
Injun die by Indian way.

881
01:11:45,884 --> 01:11:50,221
ARCHDUKE: I never used one of those.
JOE: Psst!

882
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:52,473
Real easy, see?

883
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:16,414
No wonder you people
were so easy to conquer. Give me it!

884
01:12:17,207 --> 01:12:18,541
Two thousand dollars.

885
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:21,210
Two thousand dollars?

886
01:12:21,378 --> 01:12:23,129
Two thousand. Give me that.
Two thousand.

887
01:12:27,217 --> 01:12:29,260
Come, come!

888
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:35,850
Oh, shit.

889
01:12:41,106 --> 01:12:44,484
ARCHDUKE:
I killed him. Heh-heh. I killed him.

890
01:12:44,651 --> 01:12:45,943
I really killed him.

891
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:51,115
Are you just going to leave him
for the vultures?

892
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:57,830
Never liked him much anyway.
Come, we get the money now.

893
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:09,384
JOE:
Partner, we did it!

894
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:12,595
We did it. Yeah, "we" did it.

895
01:13:12,763 --> 01:13:14,764
You son of a bitch.
He could have killed me.

896
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:19,310
- Arrows missing, bullets whiz...
- We had to make it look real.

897
01:13:19,603 --> 01:13:22,313
Real? You knew
he'd miss me by this much!

898
01:13:22,606 --> 01:13:24,190
- Shoot this.
BRET: You shoot it.

899
01:13:24,483 --> 01:13:25,983
You shoot it. I'll show you something.

900
01:13:26,276 --> 01:13:28,277
You go run.
I'll give you a 5-second start.

901
01:13:28,445 --> 01:13:31,155
- Hey, gratitude! I saved your life!
- What?

902
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:33,157
Shoot it. I'll show you.

903
01:13:37,621 --> 01:13:39,622
- Ow!
- Ha-ha-ha!

904
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:41,707
- That's not funny.
- Hurts, doesn't it?

905
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,837
Anybody who uses my bow
can't use their hand for half a day.

906
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:52,677
And fresh from the mint.
All yours. You earned it.

907
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:55,430
I'd kiss you if there weren't
so many people.

908
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:57,348
JOE:
Don't do that.

909
01:13:57,641 --> 01:14:00,518
So I guess
you'll be going now.

910
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:03,855
How will I explain I got away...

911
01:14:04,148 --> 01:14:06,441
...with my hands still attached?

912
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:10,445
Tell them you got us drunk
and escaped in the confusion.

913
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:13,197
Nobody'll believe that.
It's stupid.

914
01:14:13,490 --> 01:14:17,869
You people believe anything.
Besides, that's not $500.

915
01:14:18,036 --> 01:14:22,248
- I got the big dunce up to $1,000.
- From $500 to $1,000?

916
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:26,002
- Who's the best?
- He would've gone for $2,000.

917
01:14:26,211 --> 01:14:28,337
Uh, no! That's pushing it, really.

918
01:14:28,505 --> 01:14:30,840
All I need now is another $2,000
and I'm in the game.

919
01:14:31,049 --> 01:14:32,508
With your luck, you'll win it soon.

920
01:14:32,676 --> 01:14:35,052
With my luck,
I'll lose this 1,000.

921
01:14:35,387 --> 01:14:37,763
- Hey, what's this?
- What?

922
01:14:37,931 --> 01:14:41,726
You insult me by counting it
in front of me? It's all there.

923
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:47,690
I'm sorry Joseph, but lately,
even my close friends...

924
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:49,942
...have stiffed me.

925
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:52,862
Oh, hey, Mav!
What are friends for?

926
01:14:57,618 --> 01:14:59,577
Yeah. It's all there, isn't it?

927
01:15:05,292 --> 01:15:07,543
BRET: It was high time I hotfooted it
out of there...

928
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:11,005
...because I knew it wouldn't be long
before Joseph had a scheme...

929
01:15:11,256 --> 01:15:14,759
...to help me reinvest
my newly-acquired thousand.

930
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:21,265
CHILDREN:
Goodbye, Bert.

931
01:15:21,558 --> 01:15:24,435
BRET: The $2,000 wasn't the only thing
I was short on.

932
01:15:24,645 --> 01:15:27,271
I was really getting short on time.

933
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:09,313
BRET:
Hey!

934
01:16:13,652 --> 01:16:14,694
BRET:
Hey!

935
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:27,999
ANGEL: Should've paid your cowhands
a little more.

936
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:30,543
Lucky for you,
I don't mind being made a fool of.

937
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:32,878
I'd never let you make that poker game.

938
01:16:33,046 --> 01:16:36,299
But if you hadn't done
what you did, I might've let you live.

939
01:16:42,347 --> 01:16:44,181
But now I won't.

940
01:16:47,394 --> 01:16:51,856
BRET: It occurred to me, before I
blacked out, he might be teasing.

941
01:16:53,817 --> 01:16:55,318
And then again...

942
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:57,028
...maybe not.

943
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:03,576
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

944
01:17:03,744 --> 01:17:06,162
Whoa. Whoa.

945
01:17:08,248 --> 01:17:09,624
All right, Lord.

946
01:17:10,667 --> 01:17:14,378
That's enough. I've... I've found humility.

947
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:18,382
If you could get me out of this,
I don't mean to be...

948
01:17:19,051 --> 01:17:20,843
...too presumptuous, but...

949
01:17:21,053 --> 01:17:22,762
Whoa.

950
01:17:33,398 --> 01:17:36,150
Let's go! Go, Ollie, go!

951
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:39,278
Thank you, Lord.

952
01:17:39,571 --> 01:17:41,447
All right, Ollie.
You can stop now.

953
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:43,908
Ollie, you can stop.

954
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:46,243
You can stop, Ollie.

955
01:17:46,536 --> 01:17:49,246
You can stop. Attaboy, attaboy.

956
01:18:14,398 --> 01:18:16,232
All right, Ollie.

957
01:18:19,486 --> 01:18:21,612
Don't go, Ollie. Please don't.

958
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:24,073
Stay there, pal. Come on!

959
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:31,288
No!
No, no. Don't run!

960
01:18:42,426 --> 01:18:43,801
Ollie!

961
01:19:07,534 --> 01:19:10,119
ANNABELLE:
Bret! Bret!

962
01:19:10,287 --> 01:19:13,289
Bret Maverick. Look at you.

963
01:19:13,457 --> 01:19:16,292
- My hero's alive and well.
- You actually seem glad to see me.

964
01:19:16,501 --> 01:19:18,335
Well, I am.

965
01:19:18,545 --> 01:19:21,505
How ever did you escape
from those hostiles?

966
01:19:24,843 --> 01:19:27,970
I'm not exactly
a whole man anymore.

967
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:50,826
Oh, Bret.
My beautiful, beautiful, perfect male.

968
01:19:51,161 --> 01:19:53,788
I don't want to seem forward, but...

969
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:56,916
...I was wondering,
could you loan me $4,000?

970
01:19:57,083 --> 01:20:02,004
I've only broken even
at the poker tables these last few days.

971
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:04,882
That means you can't enter.

972
01:20:05,091 --> 01:20:09,220
Mrs. B., if it was within my power,
I'd give you that money in a heartbeat.

973
01:20:09,429 --> 01:20:11,722
The problem is,
I'm $2,000 short myself.

974
01:20:12,015 --> 01:20:15,392
And my poor, pure heart
was just set on it.

975
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:19,396
ARCHDUKE:
This wine is for peasants!

976
01:20:23,902 --> 01:20:26,904
BRET:
Set on this, Mrs. Bransford.

977
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:32,952
Just stay as pure as you are
right now and I'll be back soon.

978
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:40,835
WOMAN: Hunting savages,
wasn't that dangerous?

979
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:44,255
ARCHDUKE: It's primitive,
but I like killing.

980
01:20:44,422 --> 01:20:46,841
Excuse me, sir,
could I have a word with you?

981
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:48,759
ARCHDUKE:
Do you know who I am?

982
01:20:49,052 --> 01:20:52,471
No, but I know who I am.
Maverick, Indian Affairs.

983
01:20:58,603 --> 01:21:02,106
It's over for you, Dukey.
Joseph talked.

984
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:04,859
I know no one with that name.

985
01:21:05,026 --> 01:21:10,030
Funny. That's exactly what he said of you
when I started investigating the murder.

986
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:13,158
But once in jail,
he told the truth, and so will you.

987
01:21:13,451 --> 01:21:15,703
But I no American.

988
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:18,831
Murder's murder, Dukey.
You're looking at...

989
01:21:18,999 --> 01:21:21,959
...a minimum of 10 years in jail
and a $6,000 fine.

990
01:21:22,168 --> 01:21:23,961
Six? Wait, wait! I have...

991
01:21:24,170 --> 01:21:26,171
...six... Six... Six thousand.

992
01:21:26,464 --> 01:21:28,340
I have 6,000.
Please help me.

993
01:21:28,508 --> 01:21:32,219
Do you know the penalty involved
in bribing someone from Indian Affairs?

994
01:21:32,387 --> 01:21:36,557
No, please, I'm going home.
Please. Take the 6. Fix it. Please.

995
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:38,309
- Take, take!
- All right.

996
01:21:38,518 --> 01:21:41,478
The courts are overworked.
I'll give you a break.

997
01:21:42,606 --> 01:21:44,315
Don't shoot any more Indians.

998
01:21:44,524 --> 01:21:46,692
- All right?
- No, no.

999
01:21:52,824 --> 01:21:55,451
BRET: Excuse me,
has there been an accident?

1000
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:59,038
Miss Annabelle, can I speak with you?
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1001
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:02,666
- Good luck, Miss Annabelle.
- Gentlemen.

1002
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:05,628
I got something to show you.

1003
01:22:07,672 --> 01:22:09,298
Close your eyes, Annabelle.

1004
01:22:13,053 --> 01:22:14,637
You're in the game!

1005
01:22:14,846 --> 01:22:17,681
Ah! I'm in the game!

1006
01:22:17,974 --> 01:22:20,684
- Best be quiet.
- Is there no end to your goodness?

1007
01:22:20,852 --> 01:22:22,311
Apparently not.

1008
01:22:23,063 --> 01:22:27,024
Heaven will kiss you for this one,
Mr. Maverick.

1009
01:22:28,151 --> 01:22:30,319
I just realized something.

1010
01:22:30,987 --> 01:22:32,196
What?

1011
01:22:32,822 --> 01:22:34,698
You can't help it, can you?

1012
01:22:36,368 --> 01:22:38,702
You are irresistible.

1013
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:48,045
If by some small chance you happen
to win, I'll expect my 50 percent.

1014
01:22:48,338 --> 01:22:51,882
Then I'll be expecting
50 percent of your winnings.

1015
01:22:52,717 --> 01:22:55,552
Perhaps we should
consider that a loan.

1016
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:28,377
ANGEL:
Let him go!

1017
01:23:34,592 --> 01:23:36,802
How'd you get here? Tell me!

1018
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:39,054
No, you tell me...

1019
01:23:39,556 --> 01:23:42,891
...what did you mean when you said
you'd never let me make it to this game?

1020
01:23:43,101 --> 01:23:45,561
Who's trying to stop me?

1021
01:23:45,729 --> 01:23:48,856
It's gonna be a pleasure
playing you again.

1022
01:23:49,482 --> 01:23:51,734
The pleasure's all yours.

1023
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:53,527
Come on.

1024
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:04,496
All right, all right!

1025
01:24:06,124 --> 01:24:08,042
All right, come on.

1026
01:24:10,795 --> 01:24:12,171
DUVALL:
Hey!

1027
01:24:12,839 --> 01:24:14,298
My, my, my.

1028
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:20,971
Hit it!

1029
01:24:25,101 --> 01:24:28,771
Welcome to my ship,
the Lauren Belle.

1030
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:31,815
And welcome to the first annual...

1031
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:34,234
...All River's
Draw Poker Championship.

1032
01:24:38,990 --> 01:24:40,282
Rules are simple.

1033
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:43,160
We play till we drop.
Winner takes all.

1034
01:24:43,328 --> 01:24:45,829
The dealer can call one break
of one hour.

1035
01:24:45,997 --> 01:24:47,664
As soon as you're busted, you're gone.

1036
01:24:49,834 --> 01:24:53,587
Twenty of us playing, which means
there's going to be 19 broken hearts.

1037
01:24:55,507 --> 01:24:57,800
Let's make it a great contest.

1038
01:24:58,009 --> 01:25:00,677
An honest, great contest.

1039
01:25:00,845 --> 01:25:02,137
For that reason...

1040
01:25:02,305 --> 01:25:06,683
...I've imported one of the West's
most remarkable lawmen.

1041
01:25:06,851 --> 01:25:08,644
Marshal Zane Cooper.

1042
01:25:08,812 --> 01:25:10,270
He'll show us how to run things.

1043
01:25:12,816 --> 01:25:16,151
Come on up here, Coop.
Tell us how you're gonna do it.

1044
01:25:19,239 --> 01:25:22,032
Thank you, Commodore Duvall.

1045
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,910
Now players,
anyone caught cheating...

1046
01:25:25,203 --> 01:25:28,205
...will forfeit his entry fee
and be banned.

1047
01:25:28,373 --> 01:25:30,207
See these?

1048
01:25:30,834 --> 01:25:35,045
They're the only two allowed here.
Anyone breaking rules...

1049
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:38,465
...better be a faster draw than me.
And better learn how to swim.

1050
01:25:45,265 --> 01:25:46,723
Thank you, sir.

1051
01:25:49,269 --> 01:25:51,019
- Commodore.
- All right, gamblers...

1052
01:25:51,187 --> 01:25:53,981
...step right up
and bring your money.

1053
01:25:55,567 --> 01:25:57,568
BRET:
After you.

1054
01:25:58,528 --> 01:25:59,945
Twenty-five thousand dollars.

1055
01:26:00,113 --> 01:26:01,572
HIGHTOWER:
That's correct. Here.

1056
01:26:01,739 --> 01:26:03,574
COOP:
Make your mark right here.

1057
01:26:04,742 --> 01:26:06,326
Thank you, sir.

1058
01:26:06,494 --> 01:26:09,079
Put in the money
and make your mark, gentlemen.

1059
01:26:09,247 --> 01:26:11,039
Good luck to you.

1060
01:26:11,207 --> 01:26:12,916
There it is.

1061
01:26:13,084 --> 01:26:15,002
I'll take good care of it.

1062
01:26:16,546 --> 01:26:19,173
Count that, would you?

1063
01:26:19,883 --> 01:26:22,759
- It's all there.
- I'm sure it is.

1064
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:37,065
The games will begin in 10 minutes.

1065
01:26:39,068 --> 01:26:44,323
Ladies and gentlemen, if we had
$25,000 more, we'd have a half-million.

1066
01:26:44,616 --> 01:26:47,326
- We're minus one entry fee.
DUVALL: What?

1067
01:26:47,493 --> 01:26:49,286
I believe it's yours.

1068
01:26:56,336 --> 01:26:58,712
COOP:
Do I need to count it?

1069
01:27:00,632 --> 01:27:02,424
DUVALL:
I don't think so.

1070
01:27:03,426 --> 01:27:05,636
Even half-million.

1071
01:27:07,597 --> 01:27:10,974
This safe was brought in
specially for this contest.

1072
01:27:11,226 --> 01:27:15,520
I selected the combination.
I'm the only one that knows it.

1073
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:19,650
Commodore, the money's as protected
as I can make it.

1074
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:22,945
DUVALL:
There it is. Gamblers...

1075
01:27:23,154 --> 01:27:27,115
...find your designated table
and let's play some poker!

1076
01:27:57,855 --> 01:27:59,398
Four aces.

1077
01:28:29,345 --> 01:28:30,721
Five thousand.

1078
01:28:47,905 --> 01:28:49,740
DEALER:
Mr. Maverick wins the pot.

1079
01:28:57,373 --> 01:28:59,249
Dumb ass.

1080
01:29:04,422 --> 01:29:05,756
ANGEL:
I'll call you.

1081
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:08,091
GAMBLER 1:
Gentlemen...

1082
01:29:08,259 --> 01:29:09,885
...four kings.

1083
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:14,473
COOP: All right, young man.
Let's go.

1084
01:29:14,766 --> 01:29:17,642
WOMAN:
Hey! A cheater!

1085
01:29:17,935 --> 01:29:19,561
GAMBLER 2:
You cheating son of a bitch!

1086
01:29:19,729 --> 01:29:21,938
Sit down! I'll handle this.

1087
01:29:22,148 --> 01:29:23,940
GAMBLER 3:
I knew it was him!

1088
01:29:24,108 --> 01:29:25,734
GAMBLER 1:
Don't touch my chips!

1089
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:38,789
GAMBLER 1: Hang on a second.
Hang on a second!

1090
01:29:38,956 --> 01:29:40,957
Where are you taking me?

1091
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:43,877
I can't swim!

1092
01:29:50,093 --> 01:29:51,927
Gentlemen, my pleasure.

1093
01:29:59,811 --> 01:30:02,604
Kings over tens, gentlemen.

1094
01:30:03,481 --> 01:30:04,940
Ripped my shirt!

1095
01:30:05,149 --> 01:30:09,319
Time to go for a swim.
Divide the chips among the players.

1096
01:30:09,654 --> 01:30:11,154
GAMBLER:
You son of a bitch!

1097
01:30:13,533 --> 01:30:15,158
COOP:
Sorry, old-timer, that's it.

1098
01:30:21,582 --> 01:30:24,751
COOP: Sir.
- If you don't mind.

1099
01:30:24,919 --> 01:30:28,213
- At your pleasure.
- Thank you, Mr. Coop.

1100
01:30:40,351 --> 01:30:41,852
GAMBLER 1:
Thank you, gentlemen.

1101
01:30:50,945 --> 01:30:54,698
GAMBLER 2: Good game, Hightower.
DEALER: Hightower retires.

1102
01:30:57,243 --> 01:30:58,702
Oh.

1103
01:31:06,210 --> 01:31:07,794
Four queens.

1104
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:15,469
Congratulations.

1105
01:31:15,636 --> 01:31:19,973
Chips'll be waiting at the main table.
Good luck in the final game.

1106
01:31:25,271 --> 01:31:26,563
Full house, kings over ace.

1107
01:31:26,856 --> 01:31:30,233
That's a good hand.
That beats one...

1108
01:31:30,401 --> 01:31:31,902
...two...

1109
01:31:32,069 --> 01:31:33,987
...three sevens.

1110
01:31:34,739 --> 01:31:36,239
But not four.

1111
01:31:36,407 --> 01:31:37,657
What?

1112
01:31:40,411 --> 01:31:42,746
I didn't...

1113
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:45,081
Sir, why don't we go get a drink?

1114
01:31:45,291 --> 01:31:48,585
Get some fresh air.
You'll feel better if you get fresh air.

1115
01:31:48,753 --> 01:31:50,795
There we go. Watch your step.

1116
01:31:57,303 --> 01:32:02,057
- I hate those sad losers.
COOP: Don't play if you can't afford it.

1117
01:32:02,266 --> 01:32:03,642
DUVALL:
How's it look?

1118
01:32:03,935 --> 01:32:06,853
COOP: It looks like you,
Mrs. Bransford, the Spaniard...

1119
01:32:07,021 --> 01:32:10,524
...and, unless a miracle happens,
Maverick.

1120
01:32:10,691 --> 01:32:12,817
Maverick, huh?

1121
01:32:12,985 --> 01:32:16,571
When it's decided,
call a break for an hour...

1122
01:32:19,617 --> 01:32:22,118
...and let's set it up at that table.

1123
01:32:23,329 --> 01:32:26,540
I was going to leave you
something, but I'm cleaned out.

1124
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:28,792
You're a hell of a player.

1125
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:31,586
Ma'am, that's the most I ever
enjoyed losing.

1126
01:32:36,425 --> 01:32:39,261
- A thousand for you.
- Thank you, ma'am.

1127
01:32:39,470 --> 01:32:45,225
Congratulations. I'll see that your chips
are set up for the next game.

1128
01:33:21,971 --> 01:33:24,222
GAMBLER:
Good luck to you, son.

1129
01:33:25,641 --> 01:33:30,145
Leave your chips here, I'll make sure
they're transferred for the final game.

1130
01:33:30,896 --> 01:33:32,647
Congratulations.

1131
01:33:42,116 --> 01:33:44,909
The players can take
a one-hour break.

1132
01:33:45,202 --> 01:33:49,831
Anyone not back in their seat at
the stroke of 5 forfeits their winnings.

1133
01:34:04,930 --> 01:34:07,515
BRET : Annabelle.
ANNABELLE : Bret.

1134
01:34:07,683 --> 01:34:09,726
BRET :
Annabelle

1135
01:34:10,061 --> 01:34:12,062
I thought you were...

1136
01:34:12,271 --> 01:34:13,897
Good morning.

1137
01:34:23,324 --> 01:34:24,699
BRET:
Sorry.

1138
01:34:58,067 --> 01:35:00,610
BELLMAN:
Thirty minutes, everybody.

1139
01:35:01,195 --> 01:35:03,613
Thirty minutes to the final game.

1140
01:35:10,996 --> 01:35:13,415
He's a good four minutes fast.

1141
01:35:13,582 --> 01:35:14,916
BELLMAN:
30 minutes...

1142
01:35:17,336 --> 01:35:18,795
CHIP MAN:
Positions, sir?

1143
01:35:19,088 --> 01:35:21,715
Dealer over there.
Give me the cards.

1144
01:35:25,928 --> 01:35:28,138
BELLMAN:
Fifteen minutes, everybody.

1145
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:32,517
- Fifteen minutes.
BRET: Maybe we better get serious.

1146
01:35:32,810 --> 01:35:34,978
CATHY: Ooh!
WAYLON: Uh-oh. Here.

1147
01:35:35,312 --> 01:35:36,813
I got it, if you don't mind.

1148
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:39,899
Madam, we have rules
about that on board ship.

1149
01:35:40,067 --> 01:35:41,317
That's my gun.

1150
01:35:41,485 --> 01:35:43,236
- It's your gun?
- Yeah, it's mine.

1151
01:35:43,404 --> 01:35:44,654
Do you swim?

1152
01:35:44,822 --> 01:35:47,741
Swim? No.
But she does and it's her gun.

1153
01:35:47,908 --> 01:35:49,367
And this one?

1154
01:35:49,535 --> 01:35:51,411
- Is this hers too?
- I'm carrying it for her.

1155
01:35:51,579 --> 01:35:53,830
- What?
COOP: Madam, is this your husband?

1156
01:35:53,998 --> 01:35:56,583
WAYLON: How about a little boat?
COOP: A little boat?

1157
01:36:30,117 --> 01:36:34,204
Well, you look particularly
ravishing for 5 in the morning.

1158
01:36:34,413 --> 01:36:37,874
Nice glow about you.
Five minutes, Mr. Maverick!

1159
01:36:44,882 --> 01:36:48,760
COOP: Four minutes!
Four minutes to game time, folks!

1160
01:37:34,056 --> 01:37:35,515
COOP:
Dealer...

1161
01:37:35,683 --> 01:37:38,059
...start dividing up Maverick's chips.

1162
01:37:38,227 --> 01:37:40,728
- Looks like he's a no-show.
- Yes, sir.

1163
01:38:14,763 --> 01:38:16,556
BRET:
Wait!

1164
01:38:18,475 --> 01:38:19,809
Excuse me.

1165
01:38:32,698 --> 01:38:35,617
Dealer, you can start the game.

1166
01:38:35,784 --> 01:38:38,036
DEALER:
Ante up, everyone, 50 dollars.

1167
01:38:50,841 --> 01:38:53,509
BRET:
A thousand and two more.

1168
01:38:55,304 --> 01:38:59,140
I'll see your 2,000 and, uh...

1169
01:38:59,308 --> 01:39:01,434
Can I bid everything I have left?

1170
01:39:01,602 --> 01:39:03,478
DEALER:
Yes, ma'am.

1171
01:39:04,730 --> 01:39:06,981
That'll be $12,000.

1172
01:39:10,736 --> 01:39:13,821
- Too rich for my blood.
- I'm out.

1173
01:39:17,826 --> 01:39:20,954
What the hell.
I feel like being silly. I'll call.

1174
01:39:26,210 --> 01:39:28,586
It's just a pair of sixes.

1175
01:39:28,754 --> 01:39:31,881
If you can beat that,
you got me licked.

1176
01:39:32,049 --> 01:39:34,968
That's not a totally unpleasant prospect.

1177
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:44,060
I'm out of the game.

1178
01:39:44,353 --> 01:39:46,396
You put me out of the game.

1179
01:39:46,563 --> 01:39:47,897
Yes, I did.

1180
01:39:48,065 --> 01:39:49,857
I didn't do any of my tells.

1181
01:39:50,025 --> 01:39:52,026
I didn't twirl my hair
or flick my teeth.

1182
01:39:54,238 --> 01:39:56,280
You held your breath.

1183
01:39:56,448 --> 01:39:58,574
No, I wasn't.

1184
01:39:59,493 --> 01:40:01,661
- Did I hold my breath?
DUVALL: Yes.

1185
01:40:01,829 --> 01:40:03,413
Did I hold my breath?

1186
01:40:03,580 --> 01:40:04,872
Did I?

1187
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:06,666
See?

1188
01:40:06,834 --> 01:40:09,502
Sorry. See, usually...

1189
01:40:09,670 --> 01:40:12,547
...when you get excited,
you breathe heavily.

1190
01:40:12,715 --> 01:40:16,009
How do you? Oh.

1191
01:40:20,014 --> 01:40:24,726
I'll just pretend I was playing
with somebody else's money.

1192
01:40:24,893 --> 01:40:28,021
BRET: Shouldn't be hard.
ANNABELLE: Gentlemen.

1193
01:40:30,399 --> 01:40:32,942
You did hold your breath.

1194
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:34,694
DEALER:
Ante up.

1195
01:41:43,597 --> 01:41:46,099
It's up to you, commodore, to open.

1196
01:41:46,266 --> 01:41:47,892
I'll open for 5,000.

1197
01:41:48,060 --> 01:41:50,520
HIGHTOWER:
Five thousand?

1198
01:41:52,356 --> 01:41:54,649
ANGEL:
I'll see your 5...

1199
01:41:55,609 --> 01:41:56,984
...and raise you 5.

1200
01:41:57,152 --> 01:41:58,611
Ten thousand to you, Mr. Maverick.

1201
01:41:58,779 --> 01:42:00,446
Call.

1202
01:42:00,614 --> 01:42:03,533
DUVALL:
And 5 more to me.

1203
01:42:05,119 --> 01:42:06,994
DEALER:
Cards, gentlemen.

1204
01:42:07,162 --> 01:42:09,497
Two cards, please.

1205
01:42:12,709 --> 01:42:15,336
DEALER: Sir?
- Two.

1206
01:42:50,539 --> 01:42:52,582
Mr. Maverick.

1207
01:42:53,083 --> 01:42:56,419
One card, but not from you.
Put the deck down.

1208
01:42:57,171 --> 01:42:58,921
What?

1209
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:02,758
I'd like a new deck,
new cut and a new shuffle.

1210
01:43:02,926 --> 01:43:05,094
I'm sorry, that isn't permitted.

1211
01:43:05,262 --> 01:43:07,471
You can have a new dealer if you'd like,
but that's it.

1212
01:43:10,392 --> 01:43:14,061
In that case,
I'd like you to deal.

1213
01:43:14,229 --> 01:43:18,316
- Me?
- Just one from the top would be sufficient.

1214
01:43:18,942 --> 01:43:21,110
I like that.

1215
01:43:21,278 --> 01:43:23,112
Shows trust.

1216
01:43:37,294 --> 01:43:41,297
The commodore has four of a kind,
Angel has a small straight flush...

1217
01:43:41,506 --> 01:43:43,925
...and I don't have the least idea
what Maverick has.

1218
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:48,554
DEALER:
It's up to you, commodore.

1219
01:43:49,973 --> 01:43:55,478
Since it looks like I'm sucking hind tit,
I think I'll just bet my whole tray.

1220
01:43:55,646 --> 01:43:58,314
The Commodore wagers $25,000.

1221
01:44:07,032 --> 01:44:09,450
ANGEL:
I'll see your 25.

1222
01:44:12,037 --> 01:44:13,829
I guess we're even.

1223
01:44:16,124 --> 01:44:19,627
I'll raise you everything I've got.

1224
01:44:23,006 --> 01:44:26,050
That's half a million dollars
to the winner.

1225
01:44:33,976 --> 01:44:36,102
BRET:
That should cover the commodore.

1226
01:44:37,854 --> 01:44:39,981
Aren't you gonna look at your card?

1227
01:44:40,148 --> 01:44:41,565
No need.

1228
01:44:41,733 --> 01:44:45,027
What are you playing at?
Look at it.

1229
01:44:45,195 --> 01:44:47,780
I'd look at my card if I were you.

1230
01:44:47,948 --> 01:44:51,450
DEALER:
This is your portion of the pot.

1231
01:44:51,618 --> 01:44:55,705
What kind of poker you playing?
Look at that card!

1232
01:44:59,501 --> 01:45:02,837
Cards have been called, commodore.
Show your cards.

1233
01:45:06,675 --> 01:45:08,843
I have two small pair.

1234
01:45:11,555 --> 01:45:13,306
Eights...

1235
01:45:13,473 --> 01:45:15,391
...and eights.

1236
01:45:22,399 --> 01:45:23,816
Thank you.

1237
01:45:30,824 --> 01:45:32,992
You're not gonna look at your card?

1238
01:45:39,583 --> 01:45:41,542
Well...

1239
01:45:43,754 --> 01:45:47,256
...how you gonna know
if you can beat my straight flush?

1240
01:45:56,683 --> 01:45:57,975
MAN:
Unbeatable!

1241
01:46:06,651 --> 01:46:08,444
DEALER:
Ten of spades.

1242
01:46:08,612 --> 01:46:10,237
Jack of spades.

1243
01:46:10,781 --> 01:46:15,117
Queen of spades
and king of spades.

1244
01:46:15,285 --> 01:46:16,619
A possible royal flush.

1245
01:46:19,956 --> 01:46:21,791
Quiet! Quiet!

1246
01:47:22,519 --> 01:47:24,645
You beat him.

1247
01:47:24,813 --> 01:47:28,149
You miserable, cheating son of a bitch!

1248
01:47:52,716 --> 01:47:54,216
BRET: Huh!
ANNABELLE: You all right?

1249
01:47:54,551 --> 01:47:56,552
I can't believe
I pulled that card. I...

1250
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:59,263
Did I ever tell you how I was in the desert?
The snakes...

1251
01:47:59,431 --> 01:48:01,098
You're babbling.

1252
01:48:01,266 --> 01:48:03,100
Shh. You're babbling.

1253
01:48:04,728 --> 01:48:06,896
DUVALL:
Your security isn't worth a damn!

1254
01:48:07,063 --> 01:48:09,064
Everybody's got a gun!

1255
01:48:24,206 --> 01:48:25,664
DUVALL:
Ladies and gents...

1256
01:48:25,832 --> 01:48:30,085
...for our presentation of one-half
million dollars to our winner...

1257
01:48:30,420 --> 01:48:32,087
...Mr. Maverick!

1258
01:48:37,719 --> 01:48:42,431
COOP: I want to congratulate you
on a game well played.

1259
01:48:42,766 --> 01:48:45,309
I wish your moment
could last longer...

1260
01:48:45,477 --> 01:48:47,603
...but I see all this money.
Hell, I just...

1261
01:48:47,771 --> 01:48:49,271
...got to take it.

1262
01:48:49,439 --> 01:48:51,023
What?

1263
01:48:51,191 --> 01:48:55,778
I'll have regrets, I'm sure,
but I'm going to take it nevertheless.

1264
01:48:55,946 --> 01:48:57,780
Move down the steps.

1265
01:49:00,784 --> 01:49:04,286
- Cut it out.
- This is no time to be brave, Bertie boy.

1266
01:49:04,454 --> 01:49:06,914
Down the stairs, now.

1267
01:49:07,123 --> 01:49:09,458
You too, commodore. Move it!

1268
01:49:09,793 --> 01:49:12,336
BELLHOP: I'll take your bag.
COOP: Get your hands off.

1269
01:49:12,504 --> 01:49:15,756
Get away from here!
Down the stairs. Move!

1270
01:49:16,132 --> 01:49:17,925
BRET:
You sidewinding son of a bitch!

1271
01:49:18,093 --> 01:49:20,970
I worked my ass off for that.
I'll be coming for it.

1272
01:49:21,137 --> 01:49:22,805
I'll look for you.

1273
01:49:22,973 --> 01:49:25,015
Look real hard! That's my money.

1274
01:49:25,183 --> 01:49:26,976
Was your money.

1275
01:49:28,645 --> 01:49:30,729
DUVALL:
Do as he said!

1276
01:49:33,108 --> 01:49:36,569
COOP: I don't want to see any faces
looking this way.

1277
01:49:39,281 --> 01:49:40,698
DUVALL: Captain!
CAPTAIN: Yes, sir?

1278
01:49:40,991 --> 01:49:42,950
- Get my gun.
- Yes, sir.

1279
01:49:44,953 --> 01:49:46,620
He's headed for the lifeboat.

1280
01:49:46,788 --> 01:49:48,789
- Try and stop him!
- Yes, sir.

1281
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,835
DUVALL: Out of my way!
I'll kill that son of a bitch.

1282
01:49:53,003 --> 01:49:55,087
COOP:
Go, go, go!

1283
01:50:07,350 --> 01:50:09,643
Aha.

1284
01:50:15,108 --> 01:50:16,525
There he is.

1285
01:50:16,693 --> 01:50:18,193
BRET:
Let him go!

1286
01:50:18,361 --> 01:50:21,280
- Let him go?
BRET: The man saved my life!

1287
01:50:21,448 --> 01:50:23,198
I can always win more money.

1288
01:50:23,491 --> 01:50:27,202
Anyway, I found out
what I came here for.

1289
01:50:27,370 --> 01:50:32,082
Do I have to remind you
that's $500,000 that bastard's taking?

1290
01:50:32,250 --> 01:50:35,753
And it grieves me,
but it's my half million.

1291
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:37,171
It's only money, right?

1292
01:50:37,339 --> 01:50:40,007
CROWD:
Right!

1293
01:50:40,175 --> 01:50:42,760
- Only money?
- It's not worth killing a man.

1294
01:50:42,927 --> 01:50:44,553
CROWD:
No!

1295
01:50:44,721 --> 01:50:47,681
I won't swear out
a warrant against him.

1296
01:50:47,891 --> 01:50:50,559
Well, I'll be damned!

1297
01:50:52,228 --> 01:50:54,396
I will be damned.

1298
01:50:55,732 --> 01:50:57,608
Let's toast our champion.

1299
01:50:58,860 --> 01:51:01,528
Our champion!

1300
01:51:28,890 --> 01:51:30,641
DUVALL:
Fiddle that Coop!

1301
01:51:30,809 --> 01:51:32,184
Goodbye!

1302
01:51:41,111 --> 01:51:42,569
ANNABELLE:
Well...

1303
01:51:44,114 --> 01:51:46,198
BRET:
Oh, here.

1304
01:51:46,950 --> 01:51:50,285
I meant to give you this.
I took it from you on the stage.

1305
01:51:50,578 --> 01:51:53,080
You should have it.

1306
01:51:53,248 --> 01:51:56,125
I meant to give you this cufflink...

1307
01:51:56,334 --> 01:51:58,377
...I took before you left
with the Indians.

1308
01:51:58,545 --> 01:52:02,756
I been looking for it.
Yeah, I have. It's all right.

1309
01:52:04,592 --> 01:52:05,926
ANNABELLE:
Well...

1310
01:52:08,012 --> 01:52:09,805
...bye.

1311
01:52:22,777 --> 01:52:27,156
You gonna miss me?

1312
01:52:28,324 --> 01:52:31,118
You are gonna miss me.

1313
01:52:32,746 --> 01:52:34,913
- How do you know?
- You were holding your breath.

1314
01:52:35,081 --> 01:52:36,498
I was not.

1315
01:52:40,170 --> 01:52:42,796
Maybe I was.

1316
01:53:03,401 --> 01:53:05,277
Well, I...

1317
01:53:06,404 --> 01:53:10,532
I guess I better go make my stage.

1318
01:53:28,218 --> 01:53:30,761
See you in Abilene.

1319
01:53:32,180 --> 01:53:34,848
New Orleans, wasn't it?

1320
01:53:35,016 --> 01:53:37,267
Either.

1321
01:54:16,224 --> 01:54:17,724
Where have you been?

1322
01:54:19,894 --> 01:54:22,271
I had to say goodbye
to a lot of people.

1323
01:54:22,438 --> 01:54:25,566
I didn't want them thinking
I was off to meet someone.

1324
01:54:25,733 --> 01:54:29,903
And I did a lot of twists and turns
and backtracked a lot...

1325
01:54:30,071 --> 01:54:33,240
...to keep anyone from following me.

1326
01:54:33,408 --> 01:54:35,492
I thought
we were in this together.

1327
01:54:35,660 --> 01:54:39,371
You win, I do nothing.
Someone else wins, I do what I did.

1328
01:54:39,539 --> 01:54:42,165
You didn't tell me
Angel was in it too.

1329
01:54:43,293 --> 01:54:45,669
Oh.

1330
01:54:45,837 --> 01:54:48,463
If Angel had won,
we'd split it the same way.

1331
01:54:48,631 --> 01:54:50,132
The reason I brought him in...

1332
01:54:50,300 --> 01:54:54,011
I telegraphed him
to keep Maverick out of the game.

1333
01:54:54,178 --> 01:54:56,138
He messed up on that.

1334
01:54:56,389 --> 01:54:58,181
Poor, dead bastard.

1335
01:55:00,310 --> 01:55:03,562
I don't like secrets.

1336
01:55:03,730 --> 01:55:06,523
Yes, well, you're probably not gonna like
this one either.

1337
01:55:06,941 --> 01:55:10,277
I don't know what it is,
I guess it's my greedy nature.

1338
01:55:10,445 --> 01:55:12,779
But I've decided...

1339
01:55:12,947 --> 01:55:15,532
...not to share it with you.

1340
01:55:25,627 --> 01:55:27,169
Uncock it.

1341
01:55:34,344 --> 01:55:36,053
Sit down, gentlemen.

1342
01:55:38,014 --> 01:55:39,848
Let's get real cozy.

1343
01:55:40,224 --> 01:55:42,351
Parlay some.

1344
01:55:46,022 --> 01:55:48,440
Put your hands down.
You look ridiculous.

1345
01:55:51,527 --> 01:55:53,862
I admit, you had me fooled.

1346
01:55:54,030 --> 01:55:56,114
Not many can.

1347
01:55:56,282 --> 01:56:00,077
But you did save my life.
It wouldn't be neighborly to kill you.

1348
01:56:00,244 --> 01:56:01,703
Besides...

1349
01:56:01,955 --> 01:56:04,873
...everybody knows
what you are now, anyway.

1350
01:56:05,041 --> 01:56:07,960
All your life's work,
all the good you did...

1351
01:56:08,127 --> 01:56:10,545
...it's all been wiped away.

1352
01:56:10,713 --> 01:56:12,673
Was it worth it?

1353
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:15,217
You got nothing to show for it.

1354
01:56:17,011 --> 01:56:19,012
What you said is all true.

1355
01:56:19,180 --> 01:56:22,182
I traded every decent thing I know
for that money.

1356
01:56:22,350 --> 01:56:23,976
You can't leave me alive.

1357
01:56:24,143 --> 01:56:25,644
I don't care where you go...

1358
01:56:25,812 --> 01:56:27,688
...one night you'll relax.

1359
01:56:27,855 --> 01:56:29,398
Guess who'll be waiting.

1360
01:56:33,653 --> 01:56:36,571
You couldn't
sneak up on a corpse, Coop.

1361
01:56:36,739 --> 01:56:38,240
Not anymore.

1362
01:56:38,408 --> 01:56:40,909
You're a decrepit old has-been.

1363
01:56:41,703 --> 01:56:44,746
Well, what're you going to do?

1364
01:56:44,914 --> 01:56:47,124
Maybe the fairest thing would be...

1365
01:56:47,291 --> 01:56:49,418
...let one of you kill the other.

1366
01:56:51,421 --> 01:56:53,422
I'll let you decide which.

1367
01:56:59,012 --> 01:57:00,429
DUVALL:
Give me that!

1368
01:57:03,224 --> 01:57:06,685
That, as they say, is that!

1369
01:57:09,272 --> 01:57:11,106
Oh, shit. Uh!

1370
01:57:17,113 --> 01:57:20,032
You dirty, rotten, double-crossed...

1371
01:57:20,199 --> 01:57:23,285
I've never committed
a cold-blooded murder in my life.

1372
01:57:27,415 --> 01:57:29,166
And I won't.

1373
01:57:30,084 --> 01:57:32,544
Not till I find Maverick.

1374
01:58:07,288 --> 01:58:10,791
Decrepit old has-been?
Couldn't sneak up on a corpse?

1375
01:58:11,334 --> 01:58:14,836
You got $500,000 in that satchel
and your gun is 8 feet away.

1376
01:58:15,088 --> 01:58:16,880
Not smart.
Not smart at all.

1377
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:19,966
Guess not.

1378
01:58:22,095 --> 01:58:24,429
It's plain to see
who won the toss-up.

1379
01:58:24,680 --> 01:58:26,306
You shoot the commodore
in the back?

1380
01:58:26,516 --> 01:58:27,808
No.

1381
01:58:27,975 --> 01:58:29,518
Good idea, but no.

1382
01:58:30,311 --> 01:58:33,021
I really enjoyed
nailing that bastard.

1383
01:58:33,189 --> 01:58:35,524
No room in poker for cheats.

1384
01:58:36,025 --> 01:58:39,945
He won't be able to touch a deck of cards
this side of the Mississippi.

1385
01:58:40,196 --> 01:58:42,572
My old pappy used to say:

1386
01:58:42,865 --> 01:58:47,202
"There is no more deeply moving
religious experience...

1387
01:58:47,411 --> 01:58:49,204
...than cheating a cheater."

1388
01:58:49,413 --> 01:58:54,251
I never said that once.
You've misquoted me all your life.

1389
01:58:54,418 --> 01:58:57,254
BRET: Are we quibbling fine points?
COOP: I'm sick of it!

1390
01:59:02,844 --> 01:59:06,763
The things you said were so dumb
I had to improve on them.

1391
01:59:07,056 --> 01:59:09,057
Dumb, huh?

1392
01:59:09,225 --> 01:59:11,393
BRET:
Will you cut that out, Pappy!

1393
01:59:11,602 --> 01:59:13,979
These are a buck apiece.
You taught me to save money.

1394
01:59:14,230 --> 01:59:16,565
COOP:
Really? Let me have one.

1395
01:59:16,941 --> 01:59:19,234
- Yeah, those are the good ones.
- They are?

1396
01:59:19,443 --> 01:59:21,069
You got a match?

1397
01:59:31,581 --> 01:59:36,418
Bret, Coop, everything good?
Enough cigars, brandy, hot water?

1398
01:59:36,627 --> 01:59:39,796
- Yell if you need anything.
COOP: Yes, Mrs. D.

1399
01:59:57,315 --> 02:00:00,066
ANNABELLE: I certainly hope
this shirt fits you.

1400
02:00:00,234 --> 02:00:02,944
It's from the best
shirtmaker in San Francisco.

1401
02:00:04,655 --> 02:00:06,114
COOP:
Isn't she sweet?

1402
02:00:06,407 --> 02:00:08,158
BRET: Hell of a shirt,
but she's robbing us.

1403
02:00:08,451 --> 02:00:12,662
Look! Here's a lot of money
and your gun is 6 feet away.

1404
02:00:12,955 --> 02:00:14,331
BRET & COOP:
Eight.

1405
02:00:14,624 --> 02:00:16,625
What a remarkable family.

1406
02:00:17,043 --> 02:00:19,461
BRET: How'd she...?
How'd you figure that?

1407
02:00:19,712 --> 02:00:22,297
You don't have
the exclusive on tells.

1408
02:00:22,506 --> 02:00:26,218
You both have the same
height and build. You both...

1409
02:00:26,469 --> 02:00:28,803
...kiss the same way,
you both...

1410
02:00:29,013 --> 02:00:33,141
...draw your guns alike and sing
the wrong words to "Amazing Grace."

1411
02:00:33,643 --> 02:00:35,227
BRET & COOP:
We do not.

1412
02:00:36,729 --> 02:00:38,521
ANNABELLE:
Hm.

1413
02:00:38,689 --> 02:00:40,815
Hm.

1414
02:00:40,983 --> 02:00:42,317
My! Such...

1415
02:00:42,485 --> 02:00:45,153
...splendid similarities.

1416
02:00:47,865 --> 02:00:51,826
From the looks of things, the lady
better bring more hot water.

1417
02:00:53,037 --> 02:00:54,329
Bye.

1418
02:01:09,345 --> 02:01:11,888
Bret, son, you know
what we ended up with?

1419
02:01:12,056 --> 02:01:13,515
What?

1420
02:01:13,683 --> 02:01:16,518
A half-a-million-dollar silk shirt.

1421
02:01:17,395 --> 02:01:20,730
Nope. We ended up with
a quarter-of-a-million-dollar silk shirt...

1422
02:01:21,023 --> 02:01:23,858
...because my old pappy used to say,
"Never put the cart..."

1423
02:01:24,068 --> 02:01:27,821
No. "Don't count..." No.
"Don't put your eggs in one basket."

1424
02:01:27,989 --> 02:01:29,698
Now that, I said.

1425
02:01:30,533 --> 02:01:34,035
- So I have a boot for you.
- A boot?

1426
02:01:36,038 --> 02:01:38,748
And the other one's twice as heavy.

1427
02:01:40,918 --> 02:01:43,753
Ah, Bret, that's my boy.

1428
02:01:44,088 --> 02:01:46,214
What are kids for?
I'd like the boot back, though.

1429
02:01:46,382 --> 02:01:47,382
Be my guest.

1430
02:01:47,550 --> 02:01:48,800
Thank you.

1431
02:01:50,052 --> 02:01:53,263
I don't know why I left
the other half in the satchel.

1432
02:01:53,431 --> 02:01:56,141
- I do.
- So do I.

1433
02:01:56,392 --> 02:01:59,227
It'll be lots of fun getting it back.

1434
02:02:00,396 --> 02:02:02,897
- Bret.
- Yes, sir?

1435
02:02:03,524 --> 02:02:05,817
Something I got to know, son.

1436
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:12,324
How did you come up
with that ace of spades?

1437
02:02:14,035 --> 02:02:15,285
You won't believe me.

1438
02:02:15,661 --> 02:02:17,662
I'm your father, I'll believe you.

1439
02:02:25,588 --> 02:02:26,921
Magic.

1440
02:02:28,090 --> 02:02:29,424
Magic?

1441
02:02:31,260 --> 02:02:32,635
Magic.

1442
02:02:40,436 --> 02:02:41,978
I believe you.

1443
02:02:43,689 --> 02:02:45,106
Thanks.
