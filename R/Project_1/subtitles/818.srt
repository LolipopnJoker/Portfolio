1
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,599
I just feel really close to you.

2
00:00:50,934 --> 00:00:52,367
You are really close to me.

3
00:00:54,605 --> 00:00:58,097
Well, this way we can share everything.

4
00:01:03,347 --> 00:01:05,338
Wow, that's so good.

5
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:09,145
Look.

6
00:01:09,786 --> 00:01:11,913
They're still so in love.

7
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:18,420
How great is that?

8
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,562
So, where do you see us going?

9
00:01:27,704 --> 00:01:30,434
Well, tonight I see us
going back to my place.

10
00:01:45,121 --> 00:01:46,088
Wow!

11
00:01:46,255 --> 00:01:48,189
-This is your house?
-Yeah.

12
00:01:48,624 --> 00:01:49,648
It's beautiful!

13
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,056
Thank you.

14
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,185
I like to come home to a nice place.

15
00:02:00,002 --> 00:02:02,197
I'm happy. Are you happy?

16
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:06,273
Oh, yeah. Happy is what I'm all about.

17
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:10,779
Tripp, as long as you're up, Son...

18
00:02:11,781 --> 00:02:15,512
Come on, Pop! Whoa, man.
Don't you knock?

19
00:02:15,618 --> 00:02:16,585
What?

20
00:02:16,686 --> 00:02:19,382
Your momma's...
She's snoring like a rhino.

21
00:02:19,488 --> 00:02:21,888
And then this music got started...

22
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:25,489
Hey, you must be Melody.

23
00:02:26,195 --> 00:02:27,219
Melissa.

24
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,127
Oh! It's Melissa!

25
00:02:30,966 --> 00:02:33,799
It's Melissa. Okay. All right.

26
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,200
Y'all have a good time.

27
00:02:35,304 --> 00:02:36,794
Night, Pop.

28
00:02:40,976 --> 00:02:42,967
You live with your parents?

29
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,706
Is that a problem?

30
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,673
Are you kidding me?

31
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:48,444
And she's leaving.

32
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:49,813
Stomping down the steps.

33
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,784
Unbelievable! Parents?

34
00:02:51,887 --> 00:02:53,047
Putting on her coat.

35
00:02:53,155 --> 00:02:55,089
Did you move that umbrella stand?

36
00:02:55,191 --> 00:02:56,920
Oh, shit!

37
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:01,226
We gotta get rid of that thing.
You know we're gonna get sued?

38
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,388
Damn it!

39
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:04,399
And she's out.

40
00:03:06,301 --> 00:03:07,825
Another one bites the dust.

41
00:03:07,936 --> 00:03:09,904
And he is still here.

42
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,000
FAILURE TO LAUNCH

43
00:04:04,058 --> 00:04:05,525
-Morning, Mom.
-Morning.

44
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,718
What do you say, Pop?

45
00:04:06,828 --> 00:04:07,920
Good morning, Son.

46
00:04:08,029 --> 00:04:09,724
Get any sleep last night?

47
00:04:26,514 --> 00:04:30,348
-Okay, honey, here you go.
-You're the best, Mom.

48
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:43,494
Are you kidding me?

49
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,795
-Have a good day.
-You, too.

50
00:04:48,902 --> 00:04:51,336
-Don't forget your snack.
-Thanks.

51
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,337
-Think fast!
-Bye!

52
00:05:19,132 --> 00:05:20,690
So you dumped Melissa?

53
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:23,531
Well, technically, she dumped me.

54
00:05:24,872 --> 00:05:26,305
What happened?

55
00:05:26,406 --> 00:05:29,341
It was last night.
We were in a restaurant.

56
00:05:29,643 --> 00:05:32,635
She sees this elderly couple
and they're holding hands,

57
00:05:32,746 --> 00:05:36,238
and then she decides to hold my hand.

58
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,583
So she smiles at me.

59
00:05:39,786 --> 00:05:43,916
Next thing I know,
she gives me "the look."

60
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:46,726
Dude, I'm so sorry.

61
00:05:46,827 --> 00:05:48,419
No harm, no foul, though.

62
00:05:48,662 --> 00:05:50,653
It was just time for her
to meet the parents.

63
00:05:51,532 --> 00:05:52,863
Not the parents.

64
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:54,456
Bye-bye, Melissa.

65
00:05:54,735 --> 00:05:55,929
Here we go again.

66
00:05:56,036 --> 00:05:57,503
Yeah. What's your point?

67
00:05:57,604 --> 00:06:00,232
The point is, my friend,

68
00:06:00,607 --> 00:06:02,404
you are afraid of love.

69
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:06,869
Bullshit. No, no, no, no, no, man,
I'm not afraid of love.

70
00:06:07,747 --> 00:06:11,046
I love love.
Look, I've had a lot of girlfriends, right?

71
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,141
And sometimes I'm the rebound guy.

72
00:06:13,252 --> 00:06:14,651
Other times, when I get lucky,

73
00:06:14,754 --> 00:06:18,121
I'm the "explore new areas
of your sexuality" guy.

74
00:06:18,224 --> 00:06:20,624
But every single time, we have fun.

75
00:06:21,193 --> 00:06:22,455
Thank you.

76
00:06:22,562 --> 00:06:25,292
I have fun, they have fun.
It's good for me, it's good for them.

77
00:06:25,398 --> 00:06:28,231
And I would argue that's it's damn good
for civilization as a whole.

78
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:29,824
If more people thought that way...

79
00:06:29,936 --> 00:06:31,028
I do sleep well at night.

80
00:06:31,137 --> 00:06:35,005
On a twin bed, with Superman sheets
that you've had since you were six.

81
00:06:35,107 --> 00:06:37,041
As opposed to you,
who sleeps in a king-sized bed

82
00:06:37,143 --> 00:06:38,201
in your mother's basement?

83
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:39,835
It's orthopedic, and I need it.

84
00:06:39,946 --> 00:06:41,436
And at least I'm not sponging
off my parents

85
00:06:41,547 --> 00:06:43,447
so I can afford to get laid
on every continent.

86
00:06:44,517 --> 00:06:47,884
I'm a rambling man. I'm a tumbleweed.
I'm a seeker of truth.

87
00:06:47,987 --> 00:06:51,115
And one truth I've learned,
a child is a parent's greatest joy.

88
00:06:52,558 --> 00:06:54,116
Which is why I can't leave
my parents' place,

89
00:06:54,226 --> 00:06:55,488
because they would miss me!

90
00:06:55,595 --> 00:06:56,687
Amen, brother!

91
00:06:56,796 --> 00:06:59,196
And yet, in America,
we're shunned for our lifestyle.

92
00:06:59,298 --> 00:07:02,165
When we should be celebrating
our lifestyle.

93
00:07:02,568 --> 00:07:04,968
-We are men who still live at home.
-Yes!

94
00:07:05,071 --> 00:07:07,232
We're not here to apologize
about who we are, or how we do it,

95
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,671
-or who we live with.
-No!

96
00:07:08,774 --> 00:07:12,039
<i>I'm looking around this table, hombres,
and I see three winners.</i>

97
00:07:12,144 --> 00:07:14,442
And to every one of those out there
who sees something different,

98
00:07:14,547 --> 00:07:15,980
I say bring it on!

99
00:07:16,082 --> 00:07:17,572
'Cause it's going to take
a stick of dynamite

100
00:07:17,683 --> 00:07:19,446
to get me out of my parents' house.

101
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,281
The boy's 35 years old!

102
00:07:22,388 --> 00:07:23,480
It's just not fair.

103
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:25,648
Thirty-five years!

104
00:07:25,758 --> 00:07:28,955
We were good parents,
and now we're supposed to be done!

105
00:07:29,061 --> 00:07:31,461
Hey, I don't blame my kid for staying.

106
00:07:31,564 --> 00:07:33,794
Our place is much nicer
than anything he can afford.

107
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:35,491
Well, our son's a flight attendant.

108
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:37,068
He travels so much
it doesn't make any sense

109
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:38,431
-to have his own apartment.
-Yeah.

110
00:07:38,536 --> 00:07:41,334
Plus he has a lot of pilot friends
who let him stay over.

111
00:07:42,974 --> 00:07:46,307
Well, I say the whole thing comes down
to being afraid to spank.

112
00:07:46,411 --> 00:07:49,209
I mean you can't build a house
without a hammer!

113
00:07:49,314 --> 00:07:51,805
Anyone for a guava smasher?

114
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:56,050
I learned to make them in Maui.
These really chase your troubles away.

115
00:07:56,154 --> 00:07:57,143
Cheers, sweetie.

116
00:07:57,255 --> 00:08:01,055
<i>And who is my hot little wahine, huh?</i>

117
00:08:02,861 --> 00:08:05,625
Bev? What is that?

118
00:08:06,031 --> 00:08:10,593
Oh, I got this in Hawaii.
This is Lono, the god of fertility.

119
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:14,602
Bud has one, too.
Do you want to see it?

120
00:08:14,706 --> 00:08:16,367
-No!
-No!

121
00:08:16,741 --> 00:08:20,541
No. I mean, what's going on here?

122
00:08:21,813 --> 00:08:23,280
-Dougie moved out!
-Dougie moved out!

123
00:08:23,381 --> 00:08:24,643
-What?
-You're kidding.

124
00:08:24,749 --> 00:08:26,114
-Yes!
-When?

125
00:08:26,217 --> 00:08:27,912
What, like two months ago!

126
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:29,748
It's been amazing!

127
00:08:29,854 --> 00:08:31,481
Hey, how many times a week
do you think we do it?

128
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:32,613
-Oh!
-Oh, Bud.

129
00:08:34,926 --> 00:08:36,291
What? Oh!

130
00:08:36,861 --> 00:08:39,489
I can't believe it. How'd you do it?
Dougie's a sweet kid, but...

131
00:08:39,597 --> 00:08:42,498
How in the world did you get him
to move out?

132
00:08:44,569 --> 00:08:45,558
He met a girl.

133
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,900
Met a girl?
Tripp meets a new girl every week.

134
00:08:48,006 --> 00:08:52,136
Well, let's just say maybe he hasn't met
the right girl.

135
00:08:56,715 --> 00:09:00,207
Al, I don't want another recliner.
I want something new.

136
00:09:00,318 --> 00:09:02,786
Hey, here's something new!

137
00:09:03,321 --> 00:09:04,686
Cup holders.

138
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:07,189
That's not what I'm talking about.

139
00:09:07,425 --> 00:09:08,756
-Okay.
-That's nice.

140
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,053
Get what you want.

141
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,323
Just know that I'm going to be having
an affair within the next six months.

142
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,422
If I've gotta recline,
I'm making it interesting.

143
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:17,500
Deal.

144
00:09:17,601 --> 00:09:18,693
Hey, gang.

145
00:09:18,802 --> 00:09:21,532
Let's stay on point here, huh?
We're picking out chairs.

146
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:24,630
Hello, Dolly!

147
00:09:24,742 --> 00:09:26,334
Son, you see her?

148
00:09:28,378 --> 00:09:29,777
Pop? Pick a chair.

149
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,006
This is the one I want.

150
00:09:31,115 --> 00:09:32,810
-Sold.
-No, that's polka dot.

151
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,281
We're not gonna put that in the house.

152
00:09:34,384 --> 00:09:35,373
Pop, relax.

153
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,453
She's taking the chair with her
when she leaves you.

154
00:09:39,323 --> 00:09:40,585
We ain't buying that chair.

155
00:09:40,691 --> 00:09:42,921
I am getting this polka-dot chair.
I've got my own money.

156
00:09:43,026 --> 00:09:45,620
Unless you start dancing again,
you're broke.

157
00:09:48,332 --> 00:09:49,731
Excuse me.

158
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,232
-That's mine.
-Yes, ma'am.

159
00:09:52,035 --> 00:09:53,559
You're buying that?

160
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,659
No.

161
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,468
Want a cocktail, blanket or anything?

162
00:10:00,577 --> 00:10:02,602
No, I just need my 20 minutes.

163
00:10:02,713 --> 00:10:04,647
-For what?
-To clear my head.

164
00:10:06,717 --> 00:10:08,582
I come here to relax.

165
00:10:09,219 --> 00:10:12,746
You know what helps me?
Put on the Food Network.

166
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,853
Takes the edge right off.

167
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,789
Gotta find what works for you.

168
00:10:19,696 --> 00:10:21,994
Okay, look, the salesmen don't mind
because I bring them coffee,

169
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:23,964
and the music selection
is a soothing blend

170
00:10:24,067 --> 00:10:26,433
of mid-'70s singer-songwriters
and smooth jazz.

171
00:10:26,537 --> 00:10:28,471
It's practically narcotic.

172
00:10:28,572 --> 00:10:30,540
And, usually, people leave me alone.

173
00:10:30,641 --> 00:10:32,074
Sure they do.

174
00:10:34,478 --> 00:10:35,809
There's what you're talking about.

175
00:10:35,913 --> 00:10:37,073
It's nice, huh?

176
00:10:37,181 --> 00:10:40,514
Yeah! I make fun of my parents,
but these babies are sweet.

177
00:10:40,884 --> 00:10:42,612
-I'm Paula.
-I'm Tripp.

178
00:10:42,718 --> 00:10:45,243
You know, usually I don't sleep
with someone on the first date.

179
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:47,481
I don't think this counts as a first date.

180
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:51,660
It would be a date if you asked me
to have a drink tonight.

181
00:10:52,895 --> 00:10:54,328
Wanna have a drink tonight?

182
00:10:54,497 --> 00:10:56,692
Can't. How about lunch tomorrow?

183
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:59,427
Sure. Wait. Tomorrow's Saturday.

184
00:11:00,603 --> 00:11:02,195
Sometimes I eat on Saturdays.

185
00:11:02,305 --> 00:11:04,398
No, I'm doing something
with my nephew.

186
00:11:05,007 --> 00:11:06,599
How about Monday?

187
00:11:08,744 --> 00:11:10,109
I'll meet you here.

188
00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:12,010
Beautiful.

189
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,952
Hey, hey!

190
00:11:25,061 --> 00:11:27,393
Hey, Paula.

191
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:30,363
Good news, it's Champagne Thursday.

192
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,792
It's Friday.

193
00:11:31,901 --> 00:11:34,335
Yeah, Thursday came twice this week.

194
00:11:35,271 --> 00:11:37,102
For the third straight week.

195
00:11:37,206 --> 00:11:39,197
There's talk of making it permanent.

196
00:11:39,308 --> 00:11:40,969
Kind of like daylight-savings time?

197
00:11:41,077 --> 00:11:43,136
Right. But for booze.

198
00:11:44,013 --> 00:11:45,878
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

199
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,945
Shut up, you whore.

200
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:52,516
I'm sorry.
Was I sipping too loudly for you?

201
00:11:52,622 --> 00:11:53,782
No, you're not sipping too loud.

202
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,518
It's that goddamn bird
outside my goddamn window.

203
00:11:56,626 --> 00:11:59,823
What the hell kind of devil bird
chirps at night?

204
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:04,764
I think it sounds kind of pretty.

205
00:12:06,669 --> 00:12:08,102
You met a guy today.

206
00:12:08,204 --> 00:12:09,694
As a matter of fact, I did.

207
00:12:09,805 --> 00:12:11,102
He's cute, too.

208
00:12:11,207 --> 00:12:12,935
I met a guy today, too.

209
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,201
Really?

210
00:12:15,076 --> 00:12:16,703
He's a radiologist.

211
00:12:16,811 --> 00:12:18,472
Well, that's a step up.

212
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,549
He offered to give me a full-body scan
next week, free of charge.

213
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:22,810
Those don't come cheap, you know.

214
00:12:22,918 --> 00:12:25,409
I know. I'm pretty excited about it.

215
00:12:29,157 --> 00:12:30,385
How cute?

216
00:12:32,494 --> 00:12:33,552
Cute.

217
00:12:34,062 --> 00:12:36,326
Well, Tripp's a really nice guy.

218
00:12:36,431 --> 00:12:39,525
He's smart, he's sweet, he's funny.

219
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,762
We had a wonderful first meeting.
I see incredible potential here.

220
00:12:42,871 --> 00:12:44,395
So all systems are go?

221
00:12:44,506 --> 00:12:46,531
Based on the initial
personality assessment,

222
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:49,109
I think that I can have your son
moved out of this house

223
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:52,008
and living on his own by June 15th.

224
00:12:52,948 --> 00:12:54,279
Hallelujah!

225
00:12:54,883 --> 00:12:57,010
Well, you know, you'd be amazed
at how many adult children

226
00:12:57,118 --> 00:12:58,278
are still living at home.

227
00:12:58,386 --> 00:13:02,083
Now, it's my opinion that the root cause
is a lack of self-esteem.

228
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,351
Oh, Oprah talks about that all the time.

229
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:05,756
Oprah don't know crap!

230
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,124
Heck, when I was growing up,
nobody had self-esteem,

231
00:13:08,229 --> 00:13:09,321
and we turned out fine.

232
00:13:09,431 --> 00:13:11,865
You're a rock, Al.
You make me a better woman.

233
00:13:11,967 --> 00:13:15,926
Look, many young men who should
be able to move out, simply can't.

234
00:13:16,037 --> 00:13:19,165
It's called "failure to launch."
And that's where I come in.

235
00:13:19,274 --> 00:13:22,402
Young men develop self-esteem best
during a romantic relationship,

236
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,273
so I simulate one.

237
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:26,472
We have a memorable meeting.

238
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:29,206
We get to know each other
over a few casual meals,

239
00:13:29,317 --> 00:13:31,046
he helps me through
an emotional crisis,

240
00:13:31,152 --> 00:13:32,483
then I meet his friends,

241
00:13:33,054 --> 00:13:34,681
if he has any,

242
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:36,484
then I let him teach me something...

243
00:13:36,591 --> 00:13:38,081
But the bottom line is,

244
00:13:38,326 --> 00:13:39,293
he bonds with me.

245
00:13:39,494 --> 00:13:41,121
He lets go of you.

246
00:13:41,262 --> 00:13:42,695
He moves out.

247
00:13:43,598 --> 00:13:47,192
But how do you make sure
that he'll fall in love with you?

248
00:13:47,301 --> 00:13:49,394
You look nice,
you find out what they like,

249
00:13:49,503 --> 00:13:51,403
and then you pretend to like it, too.

250
00:13:51,505 --> 00:13:53,530
That is pretty much how it works.

251
00:13:55,109 --> 00:13:56,235
What about sex?

252
00:13:56,343 --> 00:13:58,470
Al, I never have sex with a client.

253
00:13:58,579 --> 00:14:01,673
Besides, I need to keep Tripp motivated,

254
00:14:01,982 --> 00:14:05,008
and let's face it, after men have sex...

255
00:14:06,487 --> 00:14:08,284
Is there anything that we need to do?

256
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:11,415
Well, for starters, you could make life
a little more difficult for him.

257
00:14:11,525 --> 00:14:15,518
You know, more chores,
more responsibilities, that kind of thing.

258
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:18,860
I just think you should know that Tripp
has had some rough breaks.

259
00:14:18,966 --> 00:14:21,025
I promise you, when this is over,

260
00:14:21,135 --> 00:14:23,968
Tripp is going to be an independent,

261
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,232
self-sufficient adult.

262
00:14:27,341 --> 00:14:28,638
Shut up, dude! Don't help him!

263
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,471
-Watch the safety. No, no, no.
-No, he's in a run defense...

264
00:14:30,577 --> 00:14:31,874
Don't do it! Don't do it! I got you!
I got you!

265
00:14:31,979 --> 00:14:34,004
-Throw it to Moss. Throw it to Moss!
-Watch out! I'm going deep!

266
00:14:34,114 --> 00:14:35,604
No, you don't! Shit!

267
00:14:35,716 --> 00:14:36,740
That's a bad word, Jeffrey.

268
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,512
So is "bastard," but that just means
your parents aren't married.

269
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,917
-Look at him! Look at him!
-No! Shit!

270
00:14:41,021 --> 00:14:42,318
He could go all the way!

271
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,754
Touchdown!

272
00:14:43,857 --> 00:14:45,324
Yes!

273
00:14:45,893 --> 00:14:47,292
-Sit down!
-That's a face!

274
00:14:48,295 --> 00:14:49,353
That's great, man.

275
00:14:49,463 --> 00:14:50,930
That's good sportsmanship.
Nice dance.

276
00:14:51,031 --> 00:14:54,262
Wow, my forehead itches.

277
00:14:54,902 --> 00:14:58,235
That's cool, the "L" for loser.
Keep it up, little man.

278
00:14:58,338 --> 00:14:59,600
I'll make you walk home.

279
00:14:59,706 --> 00:15:00,866
Hell, you are such a good uncle.

280
00:15:00,974 --> 00:15:02,908
That's like eight miles.
It'll take you two days.

281
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,170
-Hey, boys.
-Hey.

282
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,745
-Hi.
-Tripp, we're going out.

283
00:15:05,846 --> 00:15:08,337
All right, listen, you got any more
chips and salsa downstairs?

284
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,280
Oh, I didn't get to the store.

285
00:15:11,318 --> 00:15:12,285
But you could go.

286
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,381
And you said you needed
your basketball shorts,

287
00:15:16,489 --> 00:15:17,888
so I put them in the laundry.

288
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,117
-Right. Thank you, babe.
-But I didn't get to it.

289
00:15:20,226 --> 00:15:22,319
So you're going to need to do a load.

290
00:15:22,428 --> 00:15:23,520
A load?

291
00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:27,531
And your bathroom needs cleaning,
so I left the stuff in the hall.

292
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:29,100
And when you're done
with the rubber gloves,

293
00:15:29,202 --> 00:15:31,432
just remember to turn them inside out.

294
00:15:31,838 --> 00:15:32,805
Bye.

295
00:15:38,444 --> 00:15:40,275
Something's wrong with your mom.

296
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,007
This is really nice.

297
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:45,084
I've never actually been
on a sailboat before.

298
00:15:45,184 --> 00:15:46,811
Hey, I'd be fine

299
00:15:46,986 --> 00:15:48,954
if I never set foot on solid ground again.

300
00:15:49,055 --> 00:15:51,683
You know, I bet I'd really love it
if we ever left the dock.

301
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:52,917
Well, yeah!

302
00:15:53,025 --> 00:15:54,856
But to actually take you out on the water
on a first date

303
00:15:54,961 --> 00:15:56,553
would be very forward of me, Paula.

304
00:15:56,662 --> 00:15:59,130
Well, so far I must say
I'm very impressed.

305
00:15:59,232 --> 00:16:01,928
Beautiful setting, a simple meal...

306
00:16:02,268 --> 00:16:04,259
I assume this technique
has worked in the past?

307
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,131
Yes, ma'am, it has.

308
00:16:06,472 --> 00:16:07,564
Is it working now?

309
00:16:07,673 --> 00:16:09,732
You know what? It kind of is.

310
00:16:13,045 --> 00:16:14,512
Let's go for a walk.

311
00:16:14,614 --> 00:16:16,707
But I'm not done with lunch.

312
00:16:17,884 --> 00:16:19,351
Yeah, you are.

313
00:16:21,654 --> 00:16:24,418
Seriously, I'm not one of those girls
who don't eat. I want...

314
00:16:24,524 --> 00:16:25,923
I wanted all of that.

315
00:16:26,025 --> 00:16:28,255
See, technically, this is not my boat.

316
00:16:28,361 --> 00:16:31,057
Actually, it's not my boat in any way.

317
00:16:31,564 --> 00:16:33,998
-What?
-I'm a boat broker. I sell boats.

318
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,729
I would love to own a boat like this,
but it's not the right time in my life.

319
00:16:37,837 --> 00:16:40,237
Besides, the guy
who does own this boat

320
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:42,068
is right behind you.

321
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:45,705
Hey there, Mr. Axelrod!
I thought you were out of town!

322
00:16:45,811 --> 00:16:47,903
Well, I was, and now I'm not.

323
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:51,413
What's going on? Is that a fork?
Are you eating on my boat?

324
00:16:51,516 --> 00:16:52,483
No.

325
00:16:54,052 --> 00:16:55,679
When did you redo the galley?

326
00:16:58,089 --> 00:16:59,283
Oh, you're in the market?

327
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,359
Might be. What's she draw?

328
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:02,858
Seven-three.

329
00:17:03,428 --> 00:17:04,793
Cherry's a little dark.

330
00:17:05,297 --> 00:17:06,662
The wife picked it.

331
00:17:06,831 --> 00:17:08,196
It's got nice lines.

332
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,858
She's fast, too.

333
00:17:10,902 --> 00:17:12,597
Well, she certainly is yare.

334
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,264
I'll think about it. Thanks for your time.

335
00:17:16,374 --> 00:17:17,841
Yes, ma'am.

336
00:17:18,176 --> 00:17:19,143
Thank you.

337
00:17:22,247 --> 00:17:24,078
You're gonna let her walk away?

338
00:17:24,182 --> 00:17:26,582
I'm giving her space, Mr. Axelrod.

339
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:28,913
Now,

340
00:17:30,188 --> 00:17:32,122
I'm going after her.

341
00:17:35,694 --> 00:17:39,721
Excuse me, ma'am.
"She certainly is yare"?

342
00:17:39,831 --> 00:17:41,162
<i>Philadelphia Story.</i>

343
00:17:41,266 --> 00:17:42,392
Sweet.

344
00:17:42,901 --> 00:17:46,803
All right, assuming
that pretending to own a yacht

345
00:17:46,905 --> 00:17:50,341
was a brilliant, romantic,
yet ultimately flawed idea,

346
00:17:50,442 --> 00:17:52,672
how do you see the rest of the date
playing out?

347
00:17:52,777 --> 00:17:57,009
I don't know. I'm so hungry I can't think.
Seagulls ate my lunch.

348
00:17:57,482 --> 00:17:58,847
What if I take you to a restaurant?

349
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,508
Are you gonna pretend to own it?

350
00:18:00,619 --> 00:18:03,816
No. All the restaurants I own
are in Europe.

351
00:18:11,696 --> 00:18:13,891
Well, hey there, Ace.
Glad you could make it, man.

352
00:18:13,999 --> 00:18:15,091
We thought you went home.

353
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,691
I fell into a deep, dark crevasse.
I was so scared.

354
00:18:19,503 --> 00:18:20,765
Did you go out with La-Z-Girl?

355
00:18:20,871 --> 00:18:22,998
Paula. I did. We had lunch.

356
00:18:23,107 --> 00:18:24,597
Will there be a second date?

357
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,335
There will be a second date.

358
00:18:26,443 --> 00:18:28,411
Yet the relationship
is doomed to failure.

359
00:18:28,512 --> 00:18:30,912
Right. And why are we doomed?

360
00:18:32,249 --> 00:18:33,739
You live with your parents?

361
00:18:33,851 --> 00:18:34,840
He's right.

362
00:18:34,952 --> 00:18:38,410
Your entire life is set up perfectly
for ending relationships.

363
00:18:38,522 --> 00:18:39,648
We've been out one time.

364
00:18:39,757 --> 00:18:42,191
She's a nice girl, I'm a nice guy,
we had fun.

365
00:18:42,293 --> 00:18:44,386
And I must tell you, son,

366
00:18:45,663 --> 00:18:47,858
nothing is doomed.

367
00:19:14,391 --> 00:19:15,983
Gnarly crash!

368
00:19:16,327 --> 00:19:17,658
What are you doing?

369
00:19:18,729 --> 00:19:21,129
Remember, we're the visitors here.

370
00:19:26,003 --> 00:19:27,197
Come on.

371
00:19:27,371 --> 00:19:30,033
-Wow. You're feeding it a little peanut?
-Yeah.

372
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,233
He gets that stuff all the time, man.

373
00:19:32,776 --> 00:19:33,970
This is what he wants.

374
00:19:34,078 --> 00:19:35,875
You want a treat from the big city, boy?

375
00:19:35,979 --> 00:19:37,913
He's not a child, Tripp.

376
00:19:39,149 --> 00:19:40,377
Look how peaceful he is.

377
00:19:40,484 --> 00:19:41,644
Come here, little boy.

378
00:19:41,752 --> 00:19:43,947
You want a little bit of chocolate,
baby-boo-boo?

379
00:19:44,054 --> 00:19:45,282
You're giving him a PowerBar?

380
00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:47,016
Everybody loves chocolate.

381
00:19:47,925 --> 00:19:49,323
Tripp, he's saying no.

382
00:19:49,425 --> 00:19:50,756
Look into my eyes.

383
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,350
He's saying no, Tripp.

384
00:19:55,898 --> 00:19:58,594
Tripp? Tripp? Dude?

385
00:20:01,804 --> 00:20:03,032
Get off!

386
00:20:08,111 --> 00:20:09,942
What is he doing? Is that a squirrel?

387
00:20:10,046 --> 00:20:11,445
No, it's a chipmunk.

388
00:20:15,184 --> 00:20:16,549
Watch the bike.

389
00:20:25,728 --> 00:20:28,060
Oh, hey. I'm Tripp.

390
00:20:28,998 --> 00:20:30,556
You must be Kit.

391
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,469
It's a mockingbird.

392
00:20:35,571 --> 00:20:36,663
Who did what?

393
00:20:36,773 --> 00:20:38,172
It's a mockingbird.

394
00:20:38,274 --> 00:20:39,536
What is?

395
00:20:39,642 --> 00:20:42,406
You don't hear that?
That annoying noise.

396
00:20:42,678 --> 00:20:44,475
Oh, yeah, now I hear it.

397
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,638
I looked it up.

398
00:20:45,748 --> 00:20:48,808
They can imitate car alarms,
and telephones, and other birds.

399
00:20:48,918 --> 00:20:50,783
I called Animal Control,
and you know what they said?

400
00:20:50,887 --> 00:20:54,653
They said I should just enjoy
one of nature's most talented singers.

401
00:20:54,757 --> 00:20:56,725
-Yeah.
-I'm gonna kill it.

402
00:20:58,428 --> 00:20:59,895
Okay, I'm all set.

403
00:21:00,229 --> 00:21:01,560
-Oh, wow.
-Hi.

404
00:21:01,664 --> 00:21:02,926
Wow, look at you.

405
00:21:03,032 --> 00:21:04,397
Well, look at you.

406
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:05,932
Sweet shoes.

407
00:21:06,068 --> 00:21:07,763
Really? Thanks.

408
00:21:08,604 --> 00:21:11,072
Okay, well, Kit, we're gonna go.
See you.

409
00:21:11,174 --> 00:21:12,607
-You ready?
-Yeah.

410
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,369
Okay, you two kids have a blast.

411
00:21:14,477 --> 00:21:17,378
-Thanks.
-Hey, Kit, good luck with the...

412
00:21:24,753 --> 00:21:26,414
It's a chipmunk bite.

413
00:21:26,521 --> 00:21:29,183
I figured.
Obviously not a normal chipmunk.

414
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,315
You're right about that.

415
00:21:30,425 --> 00:21:35,021
No, this was like a big, oversized, like,
bobcat, grizzly-bear chipmunk.

416
00:21:35,197 --> 00:21:37,165
I'm pretty fortunate to still be here.

417
00:21:37,265 --> 00:21:38,425
-Wow.
-Yeah.

418
00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:39,500
What did the doctor say?

419
00:21:39,601 --> 00:21:40,693
I didn't need to see a doctor.

420
00:21:40,802 --> 00:21:43,498
I had some cream at home
that I put on it.

421
00:21:43,638 --> 00:21:45,697
-You had chipmunk cream?
-Yeah.

422
00:21:45,807 --> 00:21:47,399
-Wow, that's lucky.
-Isn't it?

423
00:21:49,578 --> 00:21:51,102
I take it you like Japanese food.

424
00:21:51,213 --> 00:21:52,510
Oh, I love it.

425
00:21:52,614 --> 00:21:55,048
I'm also gonna order a huge dessert,
drink too much,

426
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,981
and maybe talk about my old boyfriends.

427
00:21:57,085 --> 00:21:58,643
-Yeah?
-Does that intimidate you?

428
00:21:58,753 --> 00:22:00,084
Not at all.

429
00:22:00,989 --> 00:22:02,081
Cheers, Paula.

430
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,384
Cheers.

431
00:22:06,294 --> 00:22:10,458
All right, T-R-l-double-P going in
to get a little squid.

432
00:22:12,467 --> 00:22:13,991
Do you need me to help you with that?

433
00:22:14,102 --> 00:22:16,696
I got it. I got it. Look at this, look at this.

434
00:22:16,905 --> 00:22:18,167
I admire the confidence.

435
00:22:18,273 --> 00:22:20,241
Thank you. I am fairly...

436
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:23,436
ambidextrous.

437
00:22:25,413 --> 00:22:26,573
Oh, shit.

438
00:22:26,681 --> 00:22:29,081
I'm sorry! Excuse me.

439
00:22:29,184 --> 00:22:30,742
Squid's a little bit greasy tonight.

440
00:22:30,852 --> 00:22:32,615
Sorry. Yeah.

441
00:22:32,721 --> 00:22:33,983
That's not easy to do.

442
00:22:34,089 --> 00:22:35,351
I didn't see anything.

443
00:22:37,025 --> 00:22:39,926
Tell me about yourself.
What do you do for a living?

444
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,794
I teach special needs kids.

445
00:22:47,802 --> 00:22:48,791
-How's the hand?
-It's fine.

446
00:22:48,904 --> 00:22:49,928
-Is it throbbing?
-No.

447
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:52,267
Is the medication wearing off?

448
00:22:53,007 --> 00:22:54,474
Gotta scratch.

449
00:22:56,477 --> 00:22:57,603
Oh, yeah.

450
00:22:57,711 --> 00:22:58,678
Well,

451
00:23:00,381 --> 00:23:01,712
home again.

452
00:23:02,116 --> 00:23:03,208
Home again.

453
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:04,441
I had a nice time.

454
00:23:04,552 --> 00:23:05,576
I did, too.

455
00:23:05,686 --> 00:23:06,880
Good.

456
00:23:07,054 --> 00:23:08,214
I had fun.

457
00:23:08,322 --> 00:23:09,380
Good.

458
00:23:11,191 --> 00:23:15,025
Shut up!
Shut up you crazy bastard bird bitch!

459
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,261
Hey, Kit!

460
00:23:17,665 --> 00:23:18,893
What? Hi.

461
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,357
Can you guys see me?

462
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:22,435
-Yeah!
-Yeah.

463
00:23:22,536 --> 00:23:24,231
Oh. Great.

464
00:23:26,507 --> 00:23:27,565
What?

465
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:29,702
Dinner and a show.

466
00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:35,245
Good night.

467
00:23:36,884 --> 00:23:37,952
Good night.

468
00:23:38,152 --> 00:23:40,143
Now, what type of a boat
do you see yourself in?

469
00:23:40,254 --> 00:23:41,482
Well, I'm not sure.

470
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:43,750
But I do know that I need
to be out in the open sea.

471
00:23:43,857 --> 00:23:45,825
Well, you gotta ask yourself
some questions.

472
00:23:45,926 --> 00:23:47,553
Do you like speed?

473
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:49,854
Do you like to hear
the roar of an engine?

474
00:23:49,964 --> 00:23:52,865
Do you want to get from point A
to point B as quickly as possible?

475
00:23:52,967 --> 00:23:54,832
If that turns you on,
then you want a powerboat.

476
00:23:54,935 --> 00:23:57,802
Okay, that's it. That's it.
Power. That's me. Yes.

477
00:23:57,905 --> 00:24:00,237
Well, that's one way to go.
But maybe you want to slow down.

478
00:24:00,341 --> 00:24:02,241
You know, listen to the wind
and the water.

479
00:24:02,343 --> 00:24:04,777
Have sunrise and sunset
as your only clock.

480
00:24:04,878 --> 00:24:06,607
Know that you could go
around the world

481
00:24:06,714 --> 00:24:08,841
on less than a tank of gas.

482
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:13,742
Now, if that sounds good to you,
then maybe you're sailors.

483
00:24:13,854 --> 00:24:16,379
This is not a hobby. This...

484
00:24:16,857 --> 00:24:17,846
It's a lifestyle.

485
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:20,620
Well, now that is passion!

486
00:24:20,728 --> 00:24:22,389
-What has happened to you?
-What's happened to me?

487
00:24:22,496 --> 00:24:24,156
I want to feel the wind.

488
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:25,321
I do not want to feel...

489
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:27,365
I want to make the wind, okay? Look...

490
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:28,695
-Make the wind?
-Yeah. I'm not a sailor.

491
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,359
You don't make wind
sitting on a boat in a dock.

492
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,870
I'm a power guy. Power.
Like "power boat."

493
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:33,961
-You're a power guy?
-Excuse me.

494
00:24:34,207 --> 00:24:36,437
-I want to feel that beneath...
-Guys who drink Kahlua and cream

495
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:38,407
are not power guys, honey.

496
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:39,637
Tripp.

497
00:24:42,382 --> 00:24:44,373
Whoa, slow down, slow down, Paula.

498
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:46,884
Mr. Fritz was my best friend

499
00:24:48,688 --> 00:24:50,679
since he was a little puppy.

500
00:24:51,391 --> 00:24:53,859
Just a little fur ball.

501
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:57,485
He was too small
to even jump up on the bed

502
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,220
and now he's...

503
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,067
He's...

504
00:25:02,902 --> 00:25:04,597
Got a tissue or something?

505
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,374
-He saved my life, you know.
-He did?

506
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:13,536
And now I can't do
anything for him, and I...

507
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,489
Oh, shit.

508
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:36,758
I'm so glad you're here.

509
00:25:40,106 --> 00:25:41,869
Yeah, of course I am.

510
00:25:46,446 --> 00:25:48,573
Can I have a minute alone with him?

511
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:51,241
Thank you.

512
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,375
-I'll be right outside.
-Okay.

513
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,488
Thanks, Gretchen.

514
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:04,789
Anytime.

515
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:07,788
Gosh, Emotional Crisis Day
is so critical.

516
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,060
I cry, he cries.

517
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:11,692
It totally bonds us.

518
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:13,395
So how long do you think
he's gonna sleep for?

519
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:15,473
Half an hour.
He's only here for some dental work.

520
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,008
Oh. What's his real name, anyway?

521
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,134
I don't know.

522
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,405
I just clean their teeth
and chop their balls off.

523
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,486
God, that is so sad.

524
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,180
Yeah, it was a beautiful dog, man.

525
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:32,688
She was devastated.

526
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:35,191
Well, this is exactly what she needs.
Good choice.

527
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:37,853
-There she is. Hey, Paula.
-Hi.

528
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:40,523
Paula, these are my good friends,
Demo and Ace. Guys, Paula.

529
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:41,758
Hi, it's nice to meet you.

530
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:44,529
-I'm so sorry for your loss.
-Come on, don't.

531
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:45,864
Thank you.

532
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:48,269
-Nice suit. How you doing?
-Thank you. Hi.

533
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,806
You know, most guys would've
sent flowers, chocolates maybe,

534
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:56,244
but I gotta say,
I did not see this coming.

535
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:59,078
Well, you know,
anybody can send flowers, Paula.

536
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:02,085
Now, I'm going to let you in
on "the" secret.

537
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,314
It's called the "finger roll."
Quick fingers, light on the trigger.

538
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:07,152
See, double trigger...

539
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,652
More paintballs in less time
means victory.

540
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:12,024
Let's see it.

541
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,290
When you're out there today

542
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:16,367
and you got these paintballs
flying at you at over 200 miles an hour,

543
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:20,199
I guarantee you will not be thinking
about the late, great Mr. Fritz.

544
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:23,939
Holy moly. They really move that fast?

545
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:26,908
Oh, my God!

546
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:29,771
I'm so sorry!

547
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,006
Nice shot!

548
00:27:31,115 --> 00:27:32,673
-Oh, thanks.
-He's okay.

549
00:27:37,154 --> 00:27:38,917
Let's go shoot some strangers, huh?

550
00:27:45,996 --> 00:27:48,658
First one to paint the skirt gets a beer.

551
00:27:48,966 --> 00:27:52,367
I think that guy just laughed at me.
Who are these guys?

552
00:27:52,469 --> 00:27:54,369
They go by "Devil Babies."

553
00:27:54,471 --> 00:27:56,496
They finished third
in the National Championship.

554
00:27:56,607 --> 00:27:58,268
This should be an excellent test
of our skills.

555
00:27:58,375 --> 00:28:00,468
-Wait. These guys are champions?
-All right, all right.

556
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:02,273
They didn't win it.

557
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:04,670
Go!

558
00:28:05,115 --> 00:28:06,309
Move, move, move!

559
00:28:06,417 --> 00:28:07,748
Let's go!

560
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,353
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

561
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:12,556
Oh, my God!

562
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,757
Let's go! Go, go, go, go!

563
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,628
There you are! Look alive!

564
00:28:22,199 --> 00:28:23,166
I'm out.

565
00:28:25,069 --> 00:28:26,502
-Watch out!
-Watch it!

566
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:28,196
Come on, blondie!

567
00:28:43,954 --> 00:28:45,182
Am I out?

568
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,466
I didn't know they sold beer here.

569
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:01,796
They don't.

570
00:29:04,674 --> 00:29:07,609
There you go! Stay down, Paula!
Stay down!

571
00:29:11,648 --> 00:29:13,138
Can I have one?

572
00:29:14,918 --> 00:29:15,907
No.

573
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:17,211
Check it out!

574
00:29:27,297 --> 00:29:28,764
Warm day, huh?

575
00:29:36,639 --> 00:29:38,106
Nice talking to you.

576
00:29:41,945 --> 00:29:43,242
Damn it!

577
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,904
Paula?

578
00:29:45,014 --> 00:29:46,606
Sorry! Sorry!

579
00:29:46,716 --> 00:29:48,581
Does it count if it was an accident?

580
00:29:49,786 --> 00:29:51,014
Bad finger roll.

581
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,985
All right, I need you to come to me.

582
00:29:53,089 --> 00:29:55,990
No, thanks. I'm just gonna
stay over here till it's over.

583
00:29:56,092 --> 00:29:57,116
-Now!
-Okay.

584
00:30:01,597 --> 00:30:02,586
I'm out.

585
00:30:04,968 --> 00:30:06,367
Shit! I'm out!

586
00:30:06,469 --> 00:30:09,063
-You will not have died in vain!
-Stay down.

587
00:30:09,172 --> 00:30:11,197
Paula, where are you?

588
00:30:11,708 --> 00:30:14,006
Finger roll. Finger roll. Finger roll.

589
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:18,069
Oh, Tinkerbell!
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

590
00:30:19,148 --> 00:30:21,810
The sooner you lose,
the sooner you can go shopping!

591
00:30:24,454 --> 00:30:25,819
Oh, man!

592
00:30:26,055 --> 00:30:27,920
Who's laughing now?

593
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,091
You did it!

594
00:30:34,629 --> 00:30:35,994
-Get out of here!
-Boy, you made it!

595
00:30:36,098 --> 00:30:37,156
Come on!

596
00:30:37,265 --> 00:30:38,493
Where'd that come from?

597
00:30:38,633 --> 00:30:40,191
-Look at you!
-I love it.

598
00:30:40,302 --> 00:30:41,667
-Hey, Kit!
-Kind of fun, huh?

599
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:44,398
You know what?
I'm gonna go powder my nose.

600
00:30:45,507 --> 00:30:47,975
I take it you're over
your dead golden retriever.

601
00:30:48,076 --> 00:30:50,909
You know, if I really had a dog
and he really had died,

602
00:30:51,013 --> 00:30:53,379
I think this would have totally helped.

603
00:30:53,482 --> 00:30:55,780
Man, she's got good spatial awareness.

604
00:30:56,018 --> 00:30:57,076
And great hair!

605
00:30:57,185 --> 00:30:58,777
-Thanks.
-She's a keeper, man.

606
00:30:58,887 --> 00:31:00,980
She's really great. Really great, Tripp.

607
00:31:01,089 --> 00:31:02,681
So can we go now?

608
00:31:03,592 --> 00:31:05,059
Meeting the friends is very important.

609
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,128
Guys need to know
we not only like them,

610
00:31:07,229 --> 00:31:09,197
but we like their friends, too.

611
00:31:09,297 --> 00:31:12,266
Fine. The tall one's kind of cute.
What's he do?

612
00:31:12,367 --> 00:31:13,925
Oh, he's some kind of software writer.

613
00:31:14,036 --> 00:31:15,663
He works out of his basement,
but he makes a lot of money.

614
00:31:15,771 --> 00:31:17,432
Oh, you know what?
No, that's the little guy.

615
00:31:17,539 --> 00:31:20,201
The tall one just got fired from Kinko's.

616
00:31:22,077 --> 00:31:23,601
How will I choose?

617
00:31:23,712 --> 00:31:25,236
This is going very well.

618
00:31:25,347 --> 00:31:27,474
Good. So we can go now.

619
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,013
Not until I get "the nod."

620
00:31:30,118 --> 00:31:33,315
If I don't get "the nod,"
the friends undermine.

621
00:31:35,223 --> 00:31:37,191
I think you're getting "the nod."

622
00:31:39,594 --> 00:31:40,561
Oh, yeah.

623
00:31:40,929 --> 00:31:43,762
Oh, Tripp is just cruising
through the steps.

624
00:31:43,865 --> 00:31:48,165
In fact, I think tomorrow
I'm gonna let him teach me something.

625
00:32:00,881 --> 00:32:03,281
Now, basically there's two ways
to turn a boat.

626
00:32:03,984 --> 00:32:06,384
There's "coming about,"
which is turning into the wind,

627
00:32:06,487 --> 00:32:08,717
and there's "jibing,"
which is turning away from the wind.

628
00:32:08,823 --> 00:32:11,758
Now, jibing is something that you
never want to do with a rookie onboard,

629
00:32:11,859 --> 00:32:13,622
so let's give it a shot, huh?

630
00:32:13,727 --> 00:32:16,127
Well, wait, wait, wait.
Why is jibing bad?

631
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,562
It's not bad, it's just fun. Jibe ho!

632
00:32:18,666 --> 00:32:20,691
Come on, babe! Let's get over there!

633
00:32:25,106 --> 00:32:26,664
Come on, boy!

634
00:32:32,847 --> 00:32:33,973
Oh, my God!

635
00:32:34,715 --> 00:32:37,878
Nothing like the threat of decapitation
to make it a little more interesting.

636
00:32:40,187 --> 00:32:43,384
Make off this sheet, like so.

637
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,427
Okay.

638
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:51,387
"Jibe ho" and "making off the sheet"?

639
00:32:51,499 --> 00:32:55,060
That's too many words to learn.
I just want to get a suntan.

640
00:32:55,503 --> 00:32:56,561
Here, take the wheel.

641
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,365
What? Really?

642
00:32:58,472 --> 00:32:59,461
Oh, yeah.

643
00:32:59,573 --> 00:33:00,597
All right.

644
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:02,437
-We call it the helm.
-Okay.

645
00:33:02,543 --> 00:33:03,908
Wait, wait, wait! What are you doing?

646
00:33:04,011 --> 00:33:05,308
I'm going down below.

647
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:06,737
What's down below?

648
00:33:06,847 --> 00:33:08,576
I don't know, beer, wine, chips, rum.

649
00:33:08,682 --> 00:33:10,309
I don't know. It's not my boat.

650
00:33:10,518 --> 00:33:12,645
But I don't know what I'm doing!
I'm not kidding! Seriously!

651
00:33:12,753 --> 00:33:14,015
You're sailing!

652
00:33:14,121 --> 00:33:15,588
What if I hit something?

653
00:33:21,829 --> 00:33:23,797
I think you'll be okay. Fly.

654
00:33:24,465 --> 00:33:25,432
Wow.

655
00:33:27,201 --> 00:33:28,259
I'm sailing.

656
00:33:43,016 --> 00:33:44,142
Oh, man.

657
00:33:44,884 --> 00:33:46,647
That's gorgeous!

658
00:33:56,863 --> 00:34:00,299
You know, I thought going on a boat
was a good idea because you like it,

659
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,563
but my God! That was great!

660
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:07,638
You should buy that boat! I mean,
I'm sure it's expensive, but so what?

661
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:11,537
Well, I like that boat, but I really don't...

662
00:34:11,811 --> 00:34:12,971
Nice.

663
00:34:14,013 --> 00:34:15,674
I don't really want a new boat.

664
00:34:15,782 --> 00:34:18,808
What I would love
is an old wooden boat.

665
00:34:18,985 --> 00:34:22,751
Now, they're a lot more upkeep,
but when you're on one of those,

666
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:25,856
it's like you're part of something,
you know?

667
00:34:27,327 --> 00:34:30,990
It's like you're connected, you know,
to the original seafaring people

668
00:34:31,097 --> 00:34:33,361
who set sail into the unknown
and said things like,

669
00:34:33,466 --> 00:34:35,559
"Holy crap, that's a big wave!"

670
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:39,936
So do it. Buy a crummy old boat.

671
00:34:40,373 --> 00:34:42,102
Who cares,
as long as you're out there?

672
00:34:42,208 --> 00:34:44,301
Well, I'm working on it.

673
00:34:45,178 --> 00:34:47,806
The thing is, you gotta be ready.
I mean, it's a big commitment.

674
00:34:47,914 --> 00:34:50,007
And if you're not ready, you just end up,

675
00:34:50,116 --> 00:34:52,949
well, a Ionely guy
with a big boat payment.

676
00:34:53,286 --> 00:34:55,117
Who says you have to be Ionely?

677
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,775
-Hey.
-Oh, hey! Hi!

678
00:35:27,886 --> 00:35:29,114
I didn't know you were home.

679
00:35:29,221 --> 00:35:32,213
Yeah, everyone from work
went to T.G.I. Friday's,

680
00:35:32,324 --> 00:35:34,622
but I don't really like that place.

681
00:35:34,726 --> 00:35:36,887
-Or anyone I work with.
-Oh, good.

682
00:35:36,995 --> 00:35:40,055
So then we can stay in and watch
one of those drinking movies you like.

683
00:35:40,165 --> 00:35:41,291
Yeah.

684
00:35:45,771 --> 00:35:47,238
I smell something.

685
00:35:48,073 --> 00:35:49,665
Do you smell something?

686
00:35:51,743 --> 00:35:54,337
Oh, Tripp and I had crab today.

687
00:35:54,646 --> 00:35:56,273
No, that's not it.

688
00:35:57,282 --> 00:35:59,113
I smell fun.

689
00:36:01,453 --> 00:36:02,511
What?

690
00:36:02,621 --> 00:36:05,112
You are a dirty little fun-haver.

691
00:36:05,223 --> 00:36:08,818
That is absurd.
Tripp is a fascinating case.

692
00:36:08,927 --> 00:36:11,418
He doesn't fit the usual profile.

693
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:12,554
Of losers and shut-ins?

694
00:36:12,664 --> 00:36:14,757
I actually don't even see
why he still lives at home.

695
00:36:14,866 --> 00:36:17,460
He's got a good job,
he's got normal social skills,

696
00:36:17,569 --> 00:36:19,730
he's attractive,

697
00:36:20,138 --> 00:36:22,106
he's really sweet.

698
00:36:24,443 --> 00:36:28,937
That's so nice that you get to hang out
with such a sweet guy every day.

699
00:36:32,451 --> 00:36:36,819
It was a rewarding
and successful work day. That's all.

700
00:36:36,921 --> 00:36:37,888
Okay.

701
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:41,651
And at the end of it,
I looked into his eyes,

702
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:43,293
and I saw it.

703
00:36:44,328 --> 00:36:45,761
I've got him.

704
00:36:46,397 --> 00:36:49,560
He is as good as moved out.

705
00:36:50,968 --> 00:36:53,528
It's over. She's gotta go.

706
00:36:53,704 --> 00:36:54,864
You're dumping Paula?

707
00:36:54,972 --> 00:36:57,497
-What happened?
-Same thing that always happens.

708
00:36:57,608 --> 00:36:59,166
Everything is going along
nice and smooth,

709
00:36:59,276 --> 00:37:00,265
we're having a good time,

710
00:37:00,378 --> 00:37:02,846
and all of a sudden, out of nowhere...

711
00:37:03,147 --> 00:37:04,273
She gets serious.

712
00:37:04,382 --> 00:37:08,113
I hate to say it, boys,
but it is time to take the girl home.

713
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:09,948
-You're doing it again.
-What?

714
00:37:10,054 --> 00:37:13,990
The thing where the woman gets close
and you pull the relationship ripcord.

715
00:37:14,091 --> 00:37:16,491
Guys, it's simple. The fun's gone.

716
00:37:17,595 --> 00:37:19,586
Hey, guys, check this out!

717
00:37:21,432 --> 00:37:22,660
Hey, boy!

718
00:37:24,368 --> 00:37:26,632
Come here, boy. Come here, boy.

719
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:29,066
What's he saying, Demo?

720
00:37:31,909 --> 00:37:32,933
Where'd you go?

721
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:34,067
Where'd he go?

722
00:37:34,178 --> 00:37:36,373
-Let me ask you something, Demo.
-Yeah.

723
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,108
How's this surfing
if there are no waves?

724
00:37:41,986 --> 00:37:42,953
Tripp?

725
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:50,553
Should we go after him?

726
00:37:50,661 --> 00:37:51,821
Well, he's their passenger now.

727
00:37:51,929 --> 00:37:55,126
Passenger?
He just took him underwater!

728
00:37:55,833 --> 00:37:57,061
Take me!

729
00:38:00,604 --> 00:38:01,832
Oh, shit!

730
00:38:02,306 --> 00:38:04,796
Oh, shit! The son of a bitch bit me!

731
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,871
So you were bit by a dolphin?

732
00:38:09,979 --> 00:38:13,107
Yeah. And not just any dolphin, either.

733
00:38:13,216 --> 00:38:15,878
This was a great white dolphin,
all right?

734
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:18,448
I'm lucky to still be here.

735
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:25,087
What?

736
00:38:27,497 --> 00:38:28,691
Nothing.

737
00:38:32,869 --> 00:38:33,836
Wow!

738
00:38:34,637 --> 00:38:36,366
-This is your house?
-Yeah.

739
00:38:36,473 --> 00:38:38,373
-It's beautiful.
-Thank you.

740
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:41,433
I like to come home to a nice place.

741
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:45,808
-Come on in.
-Thank you.

742
00:38:48,384 --> 00:38:50,011
-It's very pretty.
-Thank you.

743
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,848
-You want something to drink?
-Yeah, sure.

744
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:53,422
Beer? Glass of wine?

745
00:38:53,523 --> 00:38:55,115
-Sure, wine would be great, thanks.
-Glass of wine.

746
00:38:55,225 --> 00:38:56,192
Thanks.

747
00:38:56,392 --> 00:38:59,259
Hey, Mom, Pop,
I thought y'all were going out.

748
00:38:59,362 --> 00:39:03,162
Out? What would we go out for?
We've got those brand-new chairs!

749
00:39:04,934 --> 00:39:06,060
Hello.

750
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:12,331
Tripp, who's your little friend?

751
00:39:12,442 --> 00:39:13,932
Mom, Dad, this is Paula.

752
00:39:14,043 --> 00:39:17,570
Paula, this is my mom, my dad,
Sue and Al.

753
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:20,347
Wow! Well!

754
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:22,179
-Hello. How do you do?
-Hello.

755
00:39:22,285 --> 00:39:23,445
Hi.

756
00:39:24,254 --> 00:39:26,245
It's a great pleasure to meet you both.

757
00:39:26,356 --> 00:39:27,653
Hi, Paula.

758
00:39:29,626 --> 00:39:30,593
Wow.

759
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:38,725
So you...

760
00:39:39,334 --> 00:39:41,029
You live with your parents.

761
00:39:44,273 --> 00:39:45,604
Is that a problem?

762
00:39:52,548 --> 00:39:54,106
No.

763
00:39:55,617 --> 00:39:56,879
Not for me.

764
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,420
Would you like to stay for dinner?

765
00:40:00,556 --> 00:40:03,582
Oh! Wow. I'd love to. Thank you.

766
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:04,954
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Why?

767
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:08,655
Well, it smells good,
and I'm really hungry. Aren't you?

768
00:40:08,764 --> 00:40:11,927
Yeah, I'm hungry.
But my mom here, she's cooking dinner.

769
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,524
Like she does most nights.

770
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:15,363
Right here, where I live,

771
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:16,698
with them,

772
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:20,137
in the same house I grew up in.

773
00:40:20,776 --> 00:40:22,175
That's nice.

774
00:40:23,445 --> 00:40:25,242
I'm gonna go mow the lawn.

775
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,177
Well, we're about to sit down...

776
00:40:27,282 --> 00:40:29,477
Might mow the neighbor's, too.

777
00:40:31,286 --> 00:40:34,153
Is this really okay? 'Cause I don't want
to intrude on family time.

778
00:40:34,256 --> 00:40:36,554
Oh, it's fine. I'll set another place.

779
00:40:36,658 --> 00:40:38,091
Okay, thanks.

780
00:40:40,095 --> 00:40:41,926
I'm gonna go help Dad.

781
00:40:42,798 --> 00:40:43,765
Is there...

782
00:40:44,866 --> 00:40:46,265
Is there anything I can do to help?

783
00:40:46,368 --> 00:40:48,734
Listen, I am so sorry.

784
00:40:48,837 --> 00:40:52,238
I had no idea that he was
going to bring me over here.

785
00:40:52,541 --> 00:40:54,736
But you are doing great.

786
00:40:54,843 --> 00:40:57,869
Well, you're not.
I don't know what to tell you, honey,

787
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,346
but that strict program of yours?

788
00:41:00,882 --> 00:41:02,975
You're gonna have to start deviating.

789
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,416
He's breaking up with you.

790
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:05,508
What?

791
00:41:05,621 --> 00:41:08,020
The only reason
he ever brings girls home to meet us

792
00:41:08,122 --> 00:41:09,919
is 'cause he's getting ready
to dump them.

793
00:41:10,024 --> 00:41:11,184
Really?

794
00:41:12,927 --> 00:41:13,894
Well,

795
00:41:14,795 --> 00:41:15,887
that's not happening.

796
00:41:19,867 --> 00:41:22,665
-Hey, Paula? Hey, sweetie?
-Yes?

797
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:26,297
I appreciate you staying
for dinner, all right?

798
00:41:26,407 --> 00:41:27,965
And I know that must have been
very awkward.

799
00:41:28,075 --> 00:41:29,372
Not at all.

800
00:41:29,477 --> 00:41:30,739
Not at all?

801
00:41:35,216 --> 00:41:37,548
You don't mind that my parents
are downstairs right now?

802
00:41:37,652 --> 00:41:39,483
They're asleep in their chairs.

803
00:41:41,288 --> 00:41:42,414
Don't stare.

804
00:41:43,157 --> 00:41:46,024
I'm paying for it. I'll stare if I want to.

805
00:41:50,064 --> 00:41:52,362
I'm just saying, you know, they might...

806
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,563
They might hear us.

807
00:41:54,669 --> 00:41:57,502
Why? Are you a screamer?

808
00:42:33,107 --> 00:42:34,233
Paula?

809
00:42:37,478 --> 00:42:40,605
Hey, you're up! Wow, early risers.

810
00:42:40,714 --> 00:42:43,478
Hey, listen.
FYI, work-wise, we're definitely on track.

811
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,050
Things are good. Tripp is good.

812
00:42:45,151 --> 00:42:46,812
Well, actually, he's fantastic.

813
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,150
Of course, I don't need to tell you that.
You're his parents.

814
00:42:49,255 --> 00:42:53,385
I'm just trying to say, you should be
very proud of him.

815
00:42:54,627 --> 00:42:55,594
Well...

816
00:42:56,396 --> 00:42:58,227
You got a lovely home.

817
00:43:07,038 --> 00:43:08,972
I'm sorry, miss, you're not allowed
to eat that in the store.

818
00:43:09,073 --> 00:43:10,131
Fine.

819
00:43:37,234 --> 00:43:40,135
I need to buy a gun.
How much is this big gun here?

820
00:43:40,237 --> 00:43:43,968
That's a 12-gauge shotgun.
That's a pretty powerful weapon.

821
00:43:44,075 --> 00:43:45,565
You know, for a woman your size,

822
00:43:45,676 --> 00:43:48,042
I'd probably recommend something
a little, you know...

823
00:43:48,145 --> 00:43:49,134
More compact?

824
00:43:49,246 --> 00:43:52,409
So I just point, and then I squeeze
the trigger and then boom.

825
00:43:52,516 --> 00:43:55,246
Yeah. What did you say
you were shooting?

826
00:43:55,353 --> 00:43:59,050
Twelve hundred bucks? Wow.
How much are the bullets for this?

827
00:44:02,727 --> 00:44:05,696
Shells. Shotguns use shells.
Anyway. Whatever.

828
00:44:05,796 --> 00:44:07,787
They're 15 bucks for a box of 25.

829
00:44:07,898 --> 00:44:10,661
Okay, I don't need a whole box.
I just need...

830
00:44:12,135 --> 00:44:13,102
one.

831
00:44:16,172 --> 00:44:17,139
You know,

832
00:44:20,343 --> 00:44:22,334
I get sad sometimes, too.

833
00:44:23,813 --> 00:44:26,304
So many pressures in life, you know?

834
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:30,181
Can I give you a phone number
for some people who can help...

835
00:44:30,286 --> 00:44:31,810
Oh, no.

836
00:44:31,921 --> 00:44:33,252
It's like a hotline.

837
00:44:33,356 --> 00:44:36,723
Listen, sunshine, I'm not

838
00:44:36,826 --> 00:44:38,453
-suicidal.
-No, I know.

839
00:44:38,561 --> 00:44:42,190
I just have a problem
with a mockingbird.

840
00:44:42,565 --> 00:44:43,862
Okay,

841
00:44:43,967 --> 00:44:47,061
-you can't kill a mockingbird.
-Why not?

842
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:50,037
<i>Well, for one, there's the book
To Kill a Mockingbird.</i>

843
00:44:50,507 --> 00:44:52,202
A copy of that, too, right here.

844
00:44:52,308 --> 00:44:56,506
No, it's not a manual
on how to kill mockingbirds.

845
00:44:56,613 --> 00:44:59,946
It's a classic American novel.
How do you not know this?

846
00:45:00,717 --> 00:45:02,446
I know a lot of other things.
Give me the gun!

847
00:45:02,552 --> 00:45:03,541
-No!
-Yes!

848
00:45:03,653 --> 00:45:04,950
I'm not gonna sell you this gun.

849
00:45:05,055 --> 00:45:08,047
Mockingbirds are protected under
the Federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act.

850
00:45:08,158 --> 00:45:09,250
Killing one is a crime.

851
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,122
Look, this is insane.

852
00:45:11,261 --> 00:45:12,660
I have rights, too, you know.

853
00:45:12,762 --> 00:45:15,094
Or maybe you haven't heard
of the Sixth Amendment!

854
00:45:15,198 --> 00:45:17,723
The right to a speedy and public trial?

855
00:45:19,502 --> 00:45:21,436
You. You're on my list,

856
00:45:21,671 --> 00:45:22,638
Jim.

857
00:45:22,839 --> 00:45:26,297
I got great boat shoes.

858
00:45:26,409 --> 00:45:27,398
Hi.

859
00:45:28,445 --> 00:45:30,413
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

860
00:45:30,513 --> 00:45:33,141
I got shoes for the next time
Tripp and I go sailing.

861
00:45:33,249 --> 00:45:34,944
And they're not just cute.

862
00:45:35,051 --> 00:45:36,518
Tripp says they're actually
very practical.

863
00:45:36,619 --> 00:45:37,916
They have these little ridges
on the bottom...

864
00:45:38,021 --> 00:45:39,579
Wait, wait, wait, slow down.

865
00:45:39,689 --> 00:45:40,747
Look at me.

866
00:45:40,857 --> 00:45:44,223
-What happened last night?
-What happened last night?

867
00:45:44,626 --> 00:45:46,253
I tried to end it.

868
00:45:46,462 --> 00:45:48,327
Tried, as in "you failed"?

869
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:49,522
Yeah.

870
00:45:50,432 --> 00:45:52,764
But the sex was fantastic.

871
00:45:52,868 --> 00:45:54,631
You had sex with him?

872
00:45:54,737 --> 00:45:57,535
This is not a big deal.

873
00:45:57,639 --> 00:46:01,336
What was that rule that you had about
never ever having sex with clients?

874
00:46:01,443 --> 00:46:04,469
Oh, yeah,
"I never ever have sex with my clients."

875
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:07,674
Those are my rules.
I can change them if I need to.

876
00:46:07,783 --> 00:46:09,648
It's not like I don't know what I'm doing.

877
00:46:09,752 --> 00:46:11,014
So your parents weren't home?

878
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,849
No, they were downstairs.

879
00:46:16,091 --> 00:46:17,888
-And you were upstairs?
-Yeah.

880
00:46:18,193 --> 00:46:20,320
Look, I am still in control.

881
00:46:20,429 --> 00:46:24,456
This was a one-time
emergency situation.

882
00:46:24,566 --> 00:46:26,193
You know what? It's very complicated.

883
00:46:26,301 --> 00:46:29,293
I don't have time right now
to explain to you how business works.

884
00:46:29,404 --> 00:46:32,237
You don't need to explain to me
how business works. I'm not an idiot.

885
00:46:32,341 --> 00:46:33,603
Do you know that I have a contract?

886
00:46:33,709 --> 00:46:38,612
I have fiduciary responsibilities
to uphold.

887
00:46:38,714 --> 00:46:41,512
From a fiduciary standpoint,
would you say that you had an orgasm?

888
00:46:43,886 --> 00:46:45,820
Come on! Were we talking to you?

889
00:46:45,921 --> 00:46:47,047
No. Clean that mess up.

890
00:46:47,156 --> 00:46:49,920
Hey, hey! Hey. Can we please
discuss this someplace else?

891
00:46:51,393 --> 00:46:54,055
That's okay, you guys can stay here
if you want.

892
00:46:57,099 --> 00:46:58,430
What are you gonna do now?

893
00:46:58,534 --> 00:46:59,660
I don't know.

894
00:47:00,903 --> 00:47:03,371
I'm in uncharted waters here, boys.

895
00:47:04,373 --> 00:47:07,069
My mom thinks it's her dog,
but I do all the work.

896
00:47:07,176 --> 00:47:08,609
I mean, you don't brush an Irish setter...

897
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:10,575
-You have an Irish setter?
-Yeah!

898
00:47:10,679 --> 00:47:11,941
I have a yellow Lab!

899
00:47:12,047 --> 00:47:13,809
I mean, he's getting kind of old,

900
00:47:13,915 --> 00:47:15,678
but we should definitely
get them together.

901
00:47:15,783 --> 00:47:17,148
We should...

902
00:47:17,518 --> 00:47:20,646
God, I'm so lucky. I mean, I'm so lucky.

903
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:23,747
I mean, look at you, and look at me.

904
00:47:23,858 --> 00:47:25,985
Hey, I mean, come on, look at you.

905
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,823
You're smart, you're attractive,

906
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:31,398
<i>you love the original Star Wars trilogy,</i>

907
00:47:31,499 --> 00:47:34,935
because it's all about
storytelling, and myth,

908
00:47:35,036 --> 00:47:37,163
before CGI ruined everything.

909
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:40,206
I mean, come on, what girl
wouldn't want to be with you?

910
00:47:40,308 --> 00:47:42,003
A shocking number, actually.

911
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,474
Well, you know what? It's their loss.

912
00:47:43,578 --> 00:47:45,011
<i>You show me a guy who loves Empire</i>

913
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:48,240
and I will show you a guy
who's not afraid of his imagination.

914
00:47:48,482 --> 00:47:51,815
Like with Luke gets to the cave,
and he asks Yoda what's in there,

915
00:47:51,919 --> 00:47:53,409
and Yoda says...

916
00:47:53,821 --> 00:47:56,813
"Only what you take with you."

917
00:47:57,258 --> 00:48:01,490
But he goes in anyway, because
he is not afraid of his own mind!

918
00:48:01,596 --> 00:48:03,791
Walking the path of the Jedi, that's why.

919
00:48:03,898 --> 00:48:07,425
That's you! You're Luke!

920
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:11,764
I gotta pee.

921
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,364
Didn't you just go?

922
00:48:13,474 --> 00:48:15,169
Listen, listen, I'll be right back.

923
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,799
Just don't go anywhere, okay?

924
00:48:16,911 --> 00:48:18,173
I'm not gonna go anywhere.

925
00:48:18,279 --> 00:48:19,371
All right, cool.

926
00:48:20,047 --> 00:48:21,912
But, really, don't go anywhere.

927
00:48:35,696 --> 00:48:36,685
Hiya, Paula.

928
00:48:36,797 --> 00:48:37,821
Oh, God!

929
00:48:37,932 --> 00:48:39,126
Shit!

930
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:42,098
You scared the crap out of me.

931
00:48:43,404 --> 00:48:46,770
What you doing?
This isn't your usual place, is it?

932
00:48:47,474 --> 00:48:50,136
Just, you know, just...

933
00:48:50,577 --> 00:48:52,374
having lunch with a friend.

934
00:48:54,214 --> 00:48:56,705
You always hold your friends' hands?

935
00:48:57,617 --> 00:48:59,676
Like, then I touched...
We touched hand.

936
00:48:59,786 --> 00:49:01,310
I just touched his hand.

937
00:49:01,421 --> 00:49:03,514
Well, my friends never touch my hands.

938
00:49:08,128 --> 00:49:11,757
You've put me
in a very difficult position here.

939
00:49:15,635 --> 00:49:17,262
Okay, look, what do you want?

940
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:23,197
No.

941
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:25,938
It's just coffee.
You don't have to marry him.

942
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,810
First of all,
that's the geeky computer guy.

943
00:49:28,915 --> 00:49:31,884
It's bad enough I have to go out
with a loser who still lives with his mom,

944
00:49:31,985 --> 00:49:35,819
but you led me to believe that it was
the handsome minimum-wage slacker.

945
00:49:37,257 --> 00:49:40,226
No, I don't think that I did that.

946
00:49:41,227 --> 00:49:42,717
Okay, I didn't have a choice.

947
00:49:42,829 --> 00:49:43,887
He was going to tell Tripp

948
00:49:43,997 --> 00:49:46,158
and you were the only
bargaining chip that I had.

949
00:49:46,266 --> 00:49:47,927
You should take that as a compliment.

950
00:49:48,034 --> 00:49:49,228
He's a troll.

951
00:49:49,336 --> 00:49:51,600
He's not a troll. He's... He's...

952
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:56,064
He's endearing, and quirky.

953
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,009
Oh, for Christ's sake.

954
00:49:59,212 --> 00:50:00,543
I'm coming!

955
00:50:06,186 --> 00:50:07,380
Damn it.

956
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:16,386
I hope you like fish.

957
00:50:17,796 --> 00:50:19,593
So how does Paula do it, anyway?

958
00:50:19,698 --> 00:50:21,393
It seems like it would be hard on her.

959
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,798
Does she ever get it confused
with her real life?

960
00:50:23,902 --> 00:50:26,700
What makes you think
she has a real life?

961
00:50:29,008 --> 00:50:31,169
It's just kind of a weird job.

962
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:33,503
I mean, how does one
get into that field?

963
00:50:35,614 --> 00:50:37,673
A couple of years ago, she fell for a guy

964
00:50:37,783 --> 00:50:39,808
who wouldn't move out
of his parents' house.

965
00:50:39,918 --> 00:50:42,079
I don't know, I guess
because she couldn't fix him,

966
00:50:42,187 --> 00:50:44,485
she has to fix
all the other losers out there.

967
00:50:45,891 --> 00:50:46,983
No offense.

968
00:50:47,893 --> 00:50:48,951
None taken.

969
00:50:49,828 --> 00:50:51,819
Listen, if you want to go, that's okay.

970
00:50:52,131 --> 00:50:54,258
I'm sorry I slammed the door
on your face.

971
00:50:54,366 --> 00:50:56,459
I don't sleep much.

972
00:50:58,971 --> 00:50:59,960
Really?

973
00:51:00,606 --> 00:51:01,732
Me, either.

974
00:51:02,508 --> 00:51:05,341
Just have too much stuff going on
in my head. Is that the same thing?

975
00:51:05,444 --> 00:51:06,604
No, no.

976
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,043
No. No. I want to sleep,

977
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:13,550
but I can't, because there's a bird
outside my window

978
00:51:13,652 --> 00:51:16,314
and all night long it chirps,
and it chirps, and it chirps,

979
00:51:16,422 --> 00:51:18,947
and it's annoying,
and I can't get it to shut up!

980
00:51:23,962 --> 00:51:25,429
I have a BB gun.

981
00:51:33,539 --> 00:51:35,302
Go, Omaha!

982
00:51:38,043 --> 00:51:39,010
Yeah.

983
00:51:39,778 --> 00:51:41,643
Say, did you get my message today?

984
00:51:43,882 --> 00:51:45,179
No. You know what,
I had my phone turned off.

985
00:51:45,284 --> 00:51:48,150
I was having lunch with a girlfriend.

986
00:51:48,653 --> 00:51:51,019
My teacher, Miss Kramer,
has a girlfriend.

987
00:51:51,489 --> 00:51:52,820
Oh! That's nice.

988
00:51:52,924 --> 00:51:54,016
She's a lesbian.

989
00:51:54,892 --> 00:51:56,757
Well, don't act all cool about it!

990
00:51:57,228 --> 00:51:58,718
You're jealous 'cause you like her.

991
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:01,196
You're the one
who was always staring at her shirt.

992
00:52:02,166 --> 00:52:03,155
He's lying.

993
00:52:12,477 --> 00:52:14,001
I don't hear anything.

994
00:52:15,947 --> 00:52:17,141
He'll come.

995
00:52:18,583 --> 00:52:20,107
He always comes.

996
00:52:21,686 --> 00:52:23,347
How many times did you pump it?

997
00:52:25,857 --> 00:52:27,620
-Twice.
-Good.

998
00:52:27,725 --> 00:52:31,661
'Cause we don't want to kill it,
just sting it so it flies away.

999
00:52:33,131 --> 00:52:34,098
Yeah.

1000
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:39,836
So, is Kit short for Katherine?

1001
00:52:41,038 --> 00:52:44,735
Yes. Is Ace short for

1002
00:52:45,643 --> 00:52:47,008
Ace-a-rooney?

1003
00:52:47,211 --> 00:52:49,042
No, it's a nickname.

1004
00:52:49,147 --> 00:52:51,479
What, are you really good at cards
or something?

1005
00:52:52,617 --> 00:52:56,576
Until I was 10,
I had an undescended testicle.

1006
00:53:04,061 --> 00:53:05,119
Wait!

1007
00:53:08,166 --> 00:53:09,190
There you are.

1008
00:53:10,134 --> 00:53:11,761
Say good night, birdie.

1009
00:53:14,672 --> 00:53:15,730
I got him!

1010
00:53:18,508 --> 00:53:20,738
You pumped it more than twice,
didn't you?

1011
00:53:23,013 --> 00:53:25,607
Oh, my God!
God, why'd you make me do that?

1012
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:28,083
-Clear the table!
-Oh, God!

1013
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:30,081
-Oh, my God! Is he okay?
-I don't know.

1014
00:53:30,187 --> 00:53:31,381
-Where's he hit?
-I don't know!

1015
00:53:31,488 --> 00:53:33,183
-Is he dead?
-I...

1016
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:34,257
Oh, no!

1017
00:53:34,758 --> 00:53:37,852
Look! Look! The BB.

1018
00:53:38,228 --> 00:53:40,253
Well, maybe it's just stunned.
Do you know CPR?

1019
00:53:40,363 --> 00:53:41,694
-Well, yeah, but...
-Do it!

1020
00:53:42,065 --> 00:53:43,191
-It's a bird!
-Do it!

1021
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:46,667
Okay. Check vitals. Where's the pulse?

1022
00:53:47,304 --> 00:53:48,862
-Gently.
-Open the airway.

1023
00:53:49,139 --> 00:53:50,902
-Don't hurt him!
-I'm not hurting him!

1024
00:53:51,007 --> 00:53:51,974
God!

1025
00:53:52,609 --> 00:53:53,576
Okay. Be careful with him.

1026
00:53:53,677 --> 00:53:54,735
-He's little.
-I don't know.

1027
00:53:54,844 --> 00:53:57,438
Oh, my God, it's not working!
He's going!

1028
00:53:57,547 --> 00:53:59,344
Do something! We're losing him!

1029
00:53:59,449 --> 00:54:00,609
Not on my watch!

1030
00:54:04,254 --> 00:54:06,051
One, one thousand, two, one thousand,
three, one thousand.

1031
00:54:06,156 --> 00:54:07,783
Walk away from the light, little buddy!

1032
00:54:09,659 --> 00:54:11,593
One, one thousand, two, one thousand,
three, one thousand!

1033
00:54:11,695 --> 00:54:12,662
Please, God!

1034
00:54:15,031 --> 00:54:17,158
Oh, my God. Oh, my God! He's alive!

1035
00:54:29,512 --> 00:54:30,536
What the...

1036
00:54:42,659 --> 00:54:43,921
I'm hungry.

1037
00:54:44,027 --> 00:54:47,963
Captain, you just had nachos,
two hot dogs, and a bag of peanuts.

1038
00:54:48,331 --> 00:54:50,264
I didn't have ice cream.

1039
00:54:50,466 --> 00:54:51,831
My bad.

1040
00:54:51,934 --> 00:54:53,401
Fine. Can I have a fruit bar?

1041
00:54:53,502 --> 00:54:54,469
Now you're getting good.

1042
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:56,401
That's good. A negotiator here. All right.

1043
00:54:56,572 --> 00:54:57,800
Hey, wait for me.

1044
00:54:59,174 --> 00:55:01,233
Let's check with Miss Paula,
see if she needs anything.

1045
00:55:01,343 --> 00:55:04,210
Maybe a Royal's Number One
foam finger.

1046
00:55:04,313 --> 00:55:05,780
Don't come back without a foam finger.

1047
00:55:05,881 --> 00:55:07,075
You got it.

1048
00:55:15,024 --> 00:55:16,924
Tripp and Jeffrey are very cute together,
aren't they?

1049
00:55:17,026 --> 00:55:19,187
-Yeah. Listen, while we have a minute,
-Yeah?

1050
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:20,728
...I really want to talk to you
about the whole

1051
00:55:20,829 --> 00:55:22,729
dating-my-best-friend-for-money thing.

1052
00:55:23,565 --> 00:55:25,055
-What?
-So, this must be the date

1053
00:55:25,167 --> 00:55:27,567
where you show that you share
the guy's intense passion for something

1054
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:29,604
that, really, you don't have
the slightest interest in.

1055
00:55:30,372 --> 00:55:32,431
Okay, look, I don't know
what you heard, but...

1056
00:55:32,541 --> 00:55:33,769
Ace told me everything.

1057
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:37,235
Don't worry, I haven't ratted you out.

1058
00:55:38,547 --> 00:55:40,947
Truth is, I support your overall goal.

1059
00:55:42,251 --> 00:55:45,220
But if you really want to help him,
and I think you do,

1060
00:55:45,321 --> 00:55:46,845
you have to have all the facts.

1061
00:55:47,089 --> 00:55:49,649
Starting with the fact
that Jeffrey's not Tripp's nephew.

1062
00:55:51,327 --> 00:55:52,385
You ever heard of Amy?

1063
00:55:52,628 --> 00:55:54,596
Amy is... He's Amy's son.

1064
00:55:54,763 --> 00:55:57,994
Amy is Tripp's first love,
and she died six years ago.

1065
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,895
He never told you that, did he?

1066
00:56:02,971 --> 00:56:04,302
Oh, my God!

1067
00:56:04,707 --> 00:56:09,007
I am the worst person in the world.

1068
00:56:09,712 --> 00:56:12,772
Oh, hey, you're home. Great.

1069
00:56:12,981 --> 00:56:16,849
I have to break up with Tripp.
I'm terminating my contract, and...

1070
00:56:17,486 --> 00:56:18,475
I can't do it.

1071
00:56:19,688 --> 00:56:20,949
What happened in here?

1072
00:56:21,055 --> 00:56:22,488
Nothing. I tripped.

1073
00:56:23,157 --> 00:56:24,556
Go on with your story.

1074
00:56:24,659 --> 00:56:26,354
Oh. Well,

1075
00:56:28,463 --> 00:56:30,090
Tripp was engaged.

1076
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,566
-Okay.
-And you know Jeffrey, his nephew?

1077
00:56:34,902 --> 00:56:38,167
He's not his nephew.
He's not related to him at all.

1078
00:56:38,306 --> 00:56:41,332
Jeffrey is a boy whose mother
was gonna marry Tripp,

1079
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:43,838
and she died.

1080
00:56:45,646 --> 00:56:47,113
That's so sad.

1081
00:56:47,215 --> 00:56:48,648
God, I know.

1082
00:56:49,384 --> 00:56:50,976
Who gives a shit?

1083
00:56:51,986 --> 00:56:53,283
I beg your pardon?

1084
00:56:53,388 --> 00:56:56,221
Seriously. I've never heard you
talk this way about a client before.

1085
00:56:56,324 --> 00:56:57,814
I don't know why you're whining
about this one.

1086
00:56:57,925 --> 00:56:59,051
Because...

1087
00:56:59,861 --> 00:57:02,386
He's been through an actual tragedy!

1088
00:57:04,766 --> 00:57:08,202
This is about Tripp not being
an appropriate client.

1089
00:57:08,302 --> 00:57:10,236
It's an ethical problem.

1090
00:57:13,074 --> 00:57:14,166
Who's that?

1091
00:57:16,744 --> 00:57:17,802
What?

1092
00:57:19,046 --> 00:57:20,104
In...

1093
00:57:21,315 --> 00:57:22,839
Oh! In...

1094
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:24,178
That's Phillip.

1095
00:57:24,952 --> 00:57:26,317
Who's Phillip?

1096
00:57:27,688 --> 00:57:29,121
Phillip's...

1097
00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:30,518
I... Oh!

1098
00:57:32,827 --> 00:57:35,295
Hi, ladies.

1099
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:37,427
Did I say that you could come out?

1100
00:57:40,401 --> 00:57:42,562
Well, well, well, well, well.

1101
00:57:43,604 --> 00:57:44,901
He's nice.

1102
00:57:45,006 --> 00:57:46,371
That's nice.

1103
00:57:47,642 --> 00:57:49,940
Look, I don't see
why it's so complicated.

1104
00:57:50,044 --> 00:57:52,273
You like Tripp. Tell Tripp you like him.

1105
00:57:54,047 --> 00:57:55,344
<i>I gotta tell you something.</i>

1106
00:57:55,715 --> 00:57:57,307
I told Paula about Amy.

1107
00:57:58,418 --> 00:58:00,648
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What? What...

1108
00:58:00,754 --> 00:58:01,812
Why?

1109
00:58:01,922 --> 00:58:03,184
You were never going to.

1110
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:05,117
You never even say her name.

1111
00:58:05,425 --> 00:58:08,155
Amy was his ex-fiance.
She died about six years ago.

1112
00:58:08,261 --> 00:58:11,059
To lose love is greatest pain of all.

1113
00:58:11,164 --> 00:58:12,153
That's right.

1114
00:58:12,265 --> 00:58:14,130
It's okay to cry. We'll turn around.

1115
00:58:14,234 --> 00:58:15,724
I'm fine, guys.

1116
00:58:18,171 --> 00:58:19,229
Dude.

1117
00:58:20,874 --> 00:58:24,002
You had no right to do that, man.
That's my life.

1118
00:58:24,177 --> 00:58:25,667
You're right, you're right.
And, normally...

1119
00:58:25,779 --> 00:58:27,644
I believe everybody
needs to walk their own path,

1120
00:58:27,747 --> 00:58:30,443
but just you're not walking yours. Okay?

1121
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:32,575
You're sitting near the path, on a rock.

1122
00:58:33,587 --> 00:58:36,112
This was the only thing I could do,
given the circumstances.

1123
00:58:36,223 --> 00:58:37,690
Circumstances?

1124
00:58:38,558 --> 00:58:40,526
Brings up the other thing I gotta tell you.

1125
00:58:41,194 --> 00:58:43,424
I feel a little bit bad
because I kind of implied to Paula

1126
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:44,758
that I wouldn't say anything, but...

1127
00:58:44,865 --> 00:58:46,856
Deception's a poison.
It's like margarine.

1128
00:58:46,967 --> 00:58:48,025
I can't have that in my body.

1129
00:58:48,134 --> 00:58:50,261
God damn it, Demo, get to the point.
Come on.

1130
00:58:51,571 --> 00:58:55,007
Your parents hired Paula to date you
so that you'd move out of their house.

1131
00:58:56,176 --> 00:58:57,905
Bullshit. What are you talking about?

1132
00:58:58,211 --> 00:59:00,202
They're paying her to be your girlfriend.

1133
00:59:00,313 --> 00:59:01,575
-Paula?
-Yeah.

1134
00:59:01,681 --> 00:59:04,479
But she's a professional interventionist.
It's her job.

1135
00:59:04,651 --> 00:59:05,618
You know?

1136
00:59:07,888 --> 00:59:10,982
You're telling me it's not real?

1137
00:59:11,091 --> 00:59:14,925
No. No, it's real! It's very real!

1138
00:59:15,028 --> 00:59:16,518
Okay, you're upset right now.

1139
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:19,155
I want to encourage you to see past
that bottomless sense of betrayal.

1140
00:59:19,266 --> 00:59:20,961
Focus on the future, okay?

1141
00:59:21,067 --> 00:59:22,534
'Cause I think you guys
could work things out.

1142
00:59:22,636 --> 00:59:25,103
I mean it.
I think you crazy kids have a shot.

1143
00:59:32,912 --> 00:59:35,176
So you came home
and he was cooking?

1144
00:59:35,281 --> 00:59:36,373
Yeah.

1145
00:59:36,782 --> 00:59:37,976
Strange.

1146
00:59:38,551 --> 00:59:40,348
-Hey, you know what?
-What?

1147
00:59:40,452 --> 00:59:42,886
-Smells good.
-I know!

1148
00:59:46,392 --> 00:59:47,381
Can you get that?

1149
00:59:52,364 --> 00:59:54,958
Hi. I didn't know that you guys
were gonna be here.

1150
00:59:55,067 --> 00:59:57,535
Listen, we didn't, either. Come on in.

1151
00:59:57,636 --> 00:59:58,660
Okay. Thank you.

1152
00:59:58,771 --> 01:00:00,170
Tripp's in the kitchen.

1153
01:00:02,741 --> 01:00:04,231
That does, too.

1154
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:05,877
All right!

1155
01:00:09,782 --> 01:00:10,749
Tripp?

1156
01:00:11,317 --> 01:00:13,615
Hey, there's my girl. Come here, you.

1157
01:00:15,254 --> 01:00:16,915
Hey, what's going on?

1158
01:00:17,022 --> 01:00:18,887
Got a little family dinner.

1159
01:00:19,525 --> 01:00:22,426
All the people that I care about the most

1160
01:00:22,528 --> 01:00:24,928
together in one room. Good times.

1161
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:26,395
Hey.

1162
01:00:26,565 --> 01:00:28,396
Listen, can we talk?

1163
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,559
Absolutely. There's gonna be
plenty of time to talk over dinner.

1164
01:00:30,669 --> 01:00:32,534
But right now, I'm cooking.

1165
01:00:33,272 --> 01:00:35,502
<i>Mom, Pop, you want some more vino?</i>

1166
01:00:37,309 --> 01:00:38,503
That's good, that's good.

1167
01:00:38,611 --> 01:00:40,476
Oh, just a little bit more
for the y-o-u, babe.

1168
01:00:40,879 --> 01:00:42,210
Tripp, I don't know what to say.

1169
01:00:42,314 --> 01:00:44,475
Oh, Mom, will you knock that talk off?

1170
01:00:46,552 --> 01:00:48,782
I made this beautiful dinner tonight

1171
01:00:49,254 --> 01:00:52,553
to say thank you
to the people that I love the most.

1172
01:00:52,658 --> 01:00:54,420
All of you.

1173
01:00:54,592 --> 01:00:55,889
I'm truly blessed.

1174
01:00:55,994 --> 01:00:58,758
Mom. Pop. Sweetie.

1175
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:01,325
-That's good, Son.
-Cheers.

1176
01:01:03,901 --> 01:01:05,061
Dig in!

1177
01:01:10,408 --> 01:01:13,002
Hang on. Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
I'm too excited.

1178
01:01:13,111 --> 01:01:14,874
I have an announcement to make here.

1179
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:17,047
Okay.

1180
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,517
Paula,

1181
01:01:24,088 --> 01:01:25,555
the last couple of weeks

1182
01:01:27,125 --> 01:01:29,457
that I've spent with you have been

1183
01:01:30,595 --> 01:01:31,926
amazing,

1184
01:01:32,697 --> 01:01:34,028
surprising,

1185
01:01:35,033 --> 01:01:36,193
joyful,

1186
01:01:37,201 --> 01:01:38,532
surprising.

1187
01:01:39,971 --> 01:01:43,372
I can honestly say that, because of you,

1188
01:01:45,443 --> 01:01:49,470
I've experienced emotions
that I didn't even know I had.

1189
01:01:53,518 --> 01:01:55,110
So call me crazy,

1190
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:56,844
but I think

1191
01:01:57,221 --> 01:01:58,586
we should move in together.

1192
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:01,289
That's my boy!

1193
01:02:02,326 --> 01:02:03,850
You okay, baby? Want some water?

1194
01:02:05,063 --> 01:02:06,030
Thank you.

1195
01:02:06,497 --> 01:02:08,328
That's wonderful news.

1196
01:02:08,666 --> 01:02:10,429
I am so proud of you, Son.

1197
01:02:10,535 --> 01:02:12,833
Right? And the thing is, Mom, Dad,

1198
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:16,668
I've lived upstairs since I was three,
and it's been great.

1199
01:02:17,875 --> 01:02:21,333
All right? You two are the best parents
that a boy could ever ask for.

1200
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:25,143
I mean, I can only hope that I'm going
to be able to give my kids,

1201
01:02:28,785 --> 01:02:30,013
our kids,

1202
01:02:30,687 --> 01:02:34,316
half of the love, the respect,

1203
01:02:34,524 --> 01:02:36,515
the understanding, the support,

1204
01:02:36,626 --> 01:02:38,491
that you two have given me.

1205
01:02:39,563 --> 01:02:42,464
I guess what I'm saying is,
it is time for Tripp

1206
01:02:44,034 --> 01:02:45,524
to spread his wings.

1207
01:02:51,041 --> 01:02:52,008
Wow.

1208
01:02:53,276 --> 01:02:54,243
Well...

1209
01:02:55,345 --> 01:02:58,212
Well, this is very unexpected.

1210
01:02:58,315 --> 01:02:59,714
So here's the plan, all right?

1211
01:02:59,816 --> 01:03:01,511
We're going to blow out
the east wall of my bedroom,

1212
01:03:01,618 --> 01:03:02,915
enlarge the bathroom,

1213
01:03:03,019 --> 01:03:07,353
and basically turn the entire upstairs
into a secondary master suite

1214
01:03:07,524 --> 01:03:09,515
so there's room for the both of us,

1215
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:11,284
and the both of you,

1216
01:03:11,394 --> 01:03:12,361
under the same roof.

1217
01:03:12,462 --> 01:03:13,622
What do you say?

1218
01:03:21,605 --> 01:03:24,836
I'm not understanding.
You want Paula to move in here?

1219
01:03:24,941 --> 01:03:27,102
Yes! It's the perfect solution.

1220
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:30,077
Mom, Dad, you like her.
Paula, you like them.

1221
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:34,207
We're all gonna be right here together
under one roof, a big happy family.

1222
01:03:34,317 --> 01:03:36,285
I'm telling you,
I'm getting really excited about this.

1223
01:03:36,386 --> 01:03:37,580
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait just a second.

1224
01:03:37,721 --> 01:03:39,188
Take a deep breath here and...

1225
01:03:39,289 --> 01:03:41,519
Tripp, Tripp, I just think
that we should probably talk about this.

1226
01:03:41,625 --> 01:03:43,388
Just 'cause it's a big idea, and...

1227
01:03:43,493 --> 01:03:45,757
Honey, I've given this
a lot of thought, all right? It'll work!

1228
01:03:46,229 --> 01:03:49,323
And the best part about it is, Mom, Dad,

1229
01:03:51,168 --> 01:03:54,103
you won't have to keep paying Paula
to be my girlfriend.

1230
01:04:00,276 --> 01:04:02,471
What, did I say something wrong?
Come on.

1231
01:04:03,712 --> 01:04:05,339
You're all getting what you wanted.

1232
01:04:06,048 --> 01:04:09,313
Paula, you don't have to pretend
to like me anymore.

1233
01:04:09,485 --> 01:04:12,852
And, Mom, Dad,
you wanted me out of the house.

1234
01:04:16,692 --> 01:04:17,886
I'm out.

1235
01:04:31,774 --> 01:04:34,572
Tripp, wait! Tripp!

1236
01:04:35,711 --> 01:04:36,678
Tripp!

1237
01:04:38,914 --> 01:04:40,347
I don't want to hear it.

1238
01:04:40,816 --> 01:04:42,147
Come on, Tripp.

1239
01:04:44,019 --> 01:04:46,579
Please, you don't understand.

1240
01:04:46,822 --> 01:04:48,380
You're right. Now hold on.

1241
01:04:49,792 --> 01:04:51,851
I don't know what your daily rate is,

1242
01:04:51,961 --> 01:04:54,987
but that's everything
I've got in my wallet. There's $300.

1243
01:04:55,097 --> 01:04:56,564
Oh, come on, Tripp!

1244
01:04:56,665 --> 01:04:59,964
Which should be good for tonight,
especially since we didn't have sex.

1245
01:05:00,069 --> 01:05:02,469
Please, Tripp, let me just explain to you.

1246
01:05:02,571 --> 01:05:04,368
Get the fuck out of my car.

1247
01:05:12,047 --> 01:05:13,412
Oh, God.

1248
01:05:55,089 --> 01:05:56,954
So your parents gave her money.

1249
01:05:57,058 --> 01:05:59,151
My grandparents
give my baby-sitter money

1250
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:00,284
and I still like her.

1251
01:06:00,395 --> 01:06:03,125
Well, good for you, Captain.
Hey, can we talk about something else?

1252
01:06:03,231 --> 01:06:05,722
Fine. The 32 is nice.

1253
01:06:08,503 --> 01:06:10,903
But I think I see myself more in a 37.

1254
01:06:11,439 --> 01:06:12,599
What do you think?

1255
01:06:12,907 --> 01:06:14,340
Don't buy a boat, dude.

1256
01:06:15,443 --> 01:06:17,536
I love...boats.

1257
01:06:17,845 --> 01:06:20,040
No, you don't love boats.

1258
01:06:20,248 --> 01:06:23,046
You love the idea of a boat.

1259
01:06:23,618 --> 01:06:25,279
But the reality is,

1260
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:28,787
they're just a drain on your time,
your wallet, and your emotions.

1261
01:06:29,357 --> 01:06:31,348
And in the end,
she will break your heart.

1262
01:06:32,293 --> 01:06:34,557
<i>You see, because no matter how much
you care for her,</i>

1263
01:06:34,662 --> 01:06:35,890
<i>she's got no feelings for you.</i>

1264
01:06:35,997 --> 01:06:38,465
<i>I mean, look at her, she's a boat.
She's wood.</i>

1265
01:06:40,234 --> 01:06:42,600
<i>So forget buying a boat.
You want to feel pain?</i>

1266
01:06:43,171 --> 01:06:45,401
You're better off
slamming your hand in a car door.

1267
01:06:47,108 --> 01:06:50,544
You see, that's the stuff that screams,
"I live with my mother."

1268
01:06:50,945 --> 01:06:52,606
-What?
-I mean it.

1269
01:06:52,714 --> 01:06:54,375
I'm telling you as a friend.

1270
01:06:56,684 --> 01:06:58,811
You bring that weak stuff
to the playground,

1271
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:00,386
you won't last 10 minutes.

1272
01:07:02,122 --> 01:07:04,784
Thank you very much for giving me
a few minutes of your time.

1273
01:07:05,392 --> 01:07:08,452
-Why don't you sit down?
-No, no, no, thank you.

1274
01:07:08,562 --> 01:07:10,427
No, I just want to give you this.

1275
01:07:13,266 --> 01:07:15,029
-What is it?
-It's your money.

1276
01:07:15,469 --> 01:07:17,699
I'm returning it.
I know it doesn't fix anything.

1277
01:07:17,804 --> 01:07:19,465
I know that nothing can,

1278
01:07:20,607 --> 01:07:23,770
but given the circumstances,
I don't feel good keeping it, so...

1279
01:07:24,878 --> 01:07:26,106
Really, please take it.

1280
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:27,647
Okay.

1281
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:30,717
What?

1282
01:07:30,817 --> 01:07:32,876
This has never happened before.
I want you to know that.

1283
01:07:32,986 --> 01:07:35,546
He seemed like an open-and-shut case.

1284
01:07:36,523 --> 01:07:39,253
I guess I was overly confident.

1285
01:07:39,526 --> 01:07:40,959
I don't know. And he...

1286
01:07:41,862 --> 01:07:44,422
He won't return
any of my phone calls, and I...

1287
01:07:46,133 --> 01:07:48,397
I keep replaying it over and over
in my mind. I just...

1288
01:07:48,502 --> 01:07:50,197
I don't know where I...

1289
01:07:53,073 --> 01:07:54,836
You're in love with our son.

1290
01:08:06,586 --> 01:08:08,816
Hey, come on, we're gonna go
rock climbing. Get in the car.

1291
01:08:08,922 --> 01:08:09,889
No.

1292
01:08:10,457 --> 01:08:12,288
You've been moping around here
for two weeks.

1293
01:08:12,392 --> 01:08:13,586
Come on, get in.

1294
01:08:14,094 --> 01:08:15,083
Nah.

1295
01:08:15,195 --> 01:08:17,288
Tripp! Come on, it's unlocked.

1296
01:08:17,397 --> 01:08:19,695
It wants you to get in.
Come on. Get in the car, Tripp.

1297
01:08:20,901 --> 01:08:22,630
Isn't this great, guys?

1298
01:08:23,036 --> 01:08:24,765
How you doing up there, Tripp?

1299
01:08:24,871 --> 01:08:27,169
-You feeling it?
-Yeah, baby.

1300
01:08:27,274 --> 01:08:29,003
This is a nice rock.

1301
01:08:29,543 --> 01:08:31,510
-Aren't you glad we came?
-Yeah.

1302
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:34,443
Doing good. This is having fun.
Aren't we?

1303
01:08:38,417 --> 01:08:40,408
You guys want any carrots?

1304
01:08:41,253 --> 01:08:43,414
Tripp, you should call Paula.

1305
01:08:44,190 --> 01:08:46,658
-She wants to see you.
-That's enough, Demo!

1306
01:08:48,694 --> 01:08:50,184
A little slack, Ace!

1307
01:08:51,497 --> 01:08:52,623
Here you go.

1308
01:08:55,234 --> 01:08:56,462
Belay on.

1309
01:09:02,608 --> 01:09:04,235
You know, she's hurting, too.

1310
01:09:05,311 --> 01:09:06,608
She's miserable, Tripp.

1311
01:09:09,915 --> 01:09:11,212
Let it go, guys.

1312
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:15,244
Ace!

1313
01:09:30,269 --> 01:09:31,258
My bad.

1314
01:09:31,437 --> 01:09:34,634
<i>I once knew a specialist used to send
some of his patients to me.</i>

1315
01:09:35,007 --> 01:09:36,531
<i>All they needed was a little push.</i>

1316
01:09:37,076 --> 01:09:39,738
Look, Paula, this has to stop.

1317
01:09:40,146 --> 01:09:41,135
You don't sleep,

1318
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:43,807
and the only thing I've seen you eat
in the last three days

1319
01:09:43,916 --> 01:09:45,474
is a bag of Mint Milanos.

1320
01:09:45,718 --> 01:09:48,551
Well, don't worry about me.

1321
01:09:49,355 --> 01:09:51,289
I'll be gone in a couple of weeks.

1322
01:09:52,057 --> 01:09:53,490
What? Where are you going?

1323
01:09:53,592 --> 01:09:55,321
I'm moving back to Colorado.

1324
01:09:56,462 --> 01:09:58,487
What are you gonna do in Colorado?

1325
01:09:58,597 --> 01:10:01,498
-I haven't figured it out.
-Well, that's stupid.

1326
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,863
I mean, what are you gonna do
until you figure it out?

1327
01:10:03,968 --> 01:10:05,299
Move in with your parents?

1328
01:10:07,672 --> 01:10:10,937
Oh. That's so wrong.

1329
01:10:11,042 --> 01:10:15,308
Don't judge me, okay?
I mean, you, of all people?

1330
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:16,977
Pretty funny.

1331
01:10:17,081 --> 01:10:19,549
You know what?
I'm the one who's in a real relationship!

1332
01:10:19,651 --> 01:10:21,551
You're the one who lies for a living!

1333
01:10:21,653 --> 01:10:24,417
You think you're so smart,
but you don't know anything!

1334
01:10:24,522 --> 01:10:26,615
Did you really think
you'd never get caught?

1335
01:10:26,724 --> 01:10:28,282
You could've been happy
but you blew it.

1336
01:10:28,393 --> 01:10:30,418
Now you try to act
like it's everyone else's fault,

1337
01:10:30,528 --> 01:10:31,517
but it's all you.

1338
01:10:31,629 --> 01:10:33,597
And now you think
Colorado's the answer?

1339
01:10:33,698 --> 01:10:36,064
You know, Kit,
just because you finally convinced a guy

1340
01:10:36,167 --> 01:10:37,896
to sleep with you more than once

1341
01:10:38,336 --> 01:10:41,203
doesn't make you
an expert on relationships.

1342
01:10:48,713 --> 01:10:50,613
-Tripp!
-Tripp!

1343
01:10:51,115 --> 01:10:52,173
Come on up, buddy.

1344
01:10:52,283 --> 01:10:54,114
-Tripp!
-Tripp?

1345
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:56,651
Hey! Hey, buddy!

1346
01:10:56,788 --> 01:10:58,756
Come up. There you are.

1347
01:10:59,857 --> 01:11:00,983
-Is he...
-Hey.

1348
01:11:02,093 --> 01:11:03,924
Hey, guys.

1349
01:11:06,064 --> 01:11:07,554
You were bitten by a chuckwalla.

1350
01:11:07,999 --> 01:11:10,160
That shouldn't have happened.
It's a reptile of peace.

1351
01:11:10,301 --> 01:11:11,461
I have a theory.

1352
01:11:11,569 --> 01:11:14,197
This isn't the first time
that nature's lashed out at you like this.

1353
01:11:14,706 --> 01:11:17,174
I believe it's because your life

1354
01:11:17,275 --> 01:11:19,743
is fundamentally at odds
with the natural world.

1355
01:11:20,078 --> 01:11:22,308
-Huh?
-Therefore, nature rejects you.

1356
01:11:24,882 --> 01:11:26,372
You're insane.

1357
01:11:26,918 --> 01:11:28,044
Can I have some water?

1358
01:11:28,152 --> 01:11:29,483
-Yeah.
-Right here.

1359
01:11:29,587 --> 01:11:32,021
-Here we go.
-Okay, okay, easy.

1360
01:11:32,423 --> 01:11:33,946
Look, I've been all over the world.

1361
01:11:34,057 --> 01:11:36,321
You're the only human to my knowledge
who's been bitten by a dolphin,

1362
01:11:36,426 --> 01:11:38,894
a chipmunk, and a vegetarian lizard
in the same calendar year.

1363
01:11:40,264 --> 01:11:42,129
And you haven't been
a very good friend, either.

1364
01:11:42,332 --> 01:11:44,357
Do you realize that not once
have you asked me

1365
01:11:44,468 --> 01:11:45,958
about my relationship with Kit?

1366
01:11:49,506 --> 01:11:52,907
Dude, did you just drop me
from a 40-foot cliff?

1367
01:11:54,278 --> 01:11:56,371
I mean, you want
to talk about a friend, man,

1368
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:57,674
you went behind my back,

1369
01:11:57,781 --> 01:12:00,045
and blackmailed your way
into getting your girlfriend.

1370
01:12:00,217 --> 01:12:01,548
He's right.

1371
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,350
-I'm sorry I dropped you from a cliff.
-It's okay.

1372
01:12:05,522 --> 01:12:08,389
Granted, he used you,
but not out of malice.

1373
01:12:08,492 --> 01:12:10,483
Look at him.
How many chances is he gonna get?

1374
01:12:10,594 --> 01:12:12,255
He saw a chance for love, Tripp,
and he took it.

1375
01:12:12,362 --> 01:12:14,353
Which is exactly
what we wanted for you.

1376
01:12:15,065 --> 01:12:16,225
Am I getting advice

1377
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:18,801
from my two loser buddies
who still live at home?

1378
01:12:18,902 --> 01:12:20,494
Actually, I own my home.

1379
01:12:21,204 --> 01:12:22,728
-What?
-No, you don't.

1380
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:24,397
I bought it a couple of years ago
from my mom.

1381
01:12:24,508 --> 01:12:25,566
That way, she has a place to live

1382
01:12:25,676 --> 01:12:27,143
and I don't get nailed
on the inheritance tax.

1383
01:12:27,244 --> 01:12:28,370
-Smart.
-Wow.

1384
01:12:28,512 --> 01:12:31,811
And Demo, here, has chosen
the life of a wanderer.

1385
01:12:31,982 --> 01:12:34,143
I mean, sure,
he technically still lives at home.

1386
01:12:34,251 --> 01:12:36,276
-Yeah.
-But his permanent address

1387
01:12:36,386 --> 01:12:37,580
is in his heart.

1388
01:12:38,288 --> 01:12:39,482
He's a bum.

1389
01:12:41,525 --> 01:12:45,461
I think what we're trying to say
is that the two of us are happy

1390
01:12:45,796 --> 01:12:47,263
and we're perfectly functional.

1391
01:12:47,564 --> 01:12:51,227
And you, Tripp, are not.

1392
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:06,572
Mom?

1393
01:13:08,617 --> 01:13:09,641
Pop?

1394
01:13:25,868 --> 01:13:27,130
Yeah, baby!

1395
01:13:27,803 --> 01:13:29,065
Hey, Pop.

1396
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:32,837
Hey! Tripp. What are you doing here?

1397
01:13:32,942 --> 01:13:36,275
Just came by to get some stuff.
What are you doing?

1398
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:37,940
Feeding my fish.

1399
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:40,447
Yeah. I see that.

1400
01:13:42,885 --> 01:13:45,649
You're naked. In my room.

1401
01:13:46,522 --> 01:13:49,355
Well, this is my Naked Room.

1402
01:13:50,393 --> 01:13:51,758
I mean, it's my house.

1403
01:13:52,027 --> 01:13:55,895
A man ought to be able to do whatever
he wants to do in his own house.

1404
01:13:56,565 --> 01:13:58,294
Wore a suit for 40 years.

1405
01:13:58,734 --> 01:14:00,725
-So now we got 40 years of...
-No suit.

1406
01:14:00,836 --> 01:14:02,064
No suit.

1407
01:14:03,305 --> 01:14:04,567
All right.

1408
01:14:05,307 --> 01:14:06,831
I'm gonna let you get back
to feeding your fish.

1409
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:08,842
Thanks for stopping by.

1410
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:14,811
Hey, Pop? Seriously, man,
was it that bad having me around?

1411
01:14:16,919 --> 01:14:19,979
Don't be an idiot, Son.
Your mom and I love you.

1412
01:14:20,656 --> 01:14:22,089
Then why didn't you
just say something?

1413
01:14:22,191 --> 01:14:25,092
All you had to do was tell me.

1414
01:14:25,694 --> 01:14:28,629
You needed time
after Amy had passed away, Tripp.

1415
01:14:28,731 --> 01:14:31,291
And who knows how much time is right?

1416
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:34,066
Is it two years? Is it six years?

1417
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:37,400
Then I ran into Bud and Bev Nestor,
and they'd worked with Paula.

1418
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:40,403
And their son is really happy now.

1419
01:14:40,508 --> 01:14:44,706
Lives in Seattle, I think.
Married an Indian girl.

1420
01:14:45,313 --> 01:14:48,976
Anyway, it just seemed easier.

1421
01:14:49,117 --> 01:14:50,277
Easier.

1422
01:14:53,488 --> 01:14:54,580
All right.

1423
01:14:56,524 --> 01:14:57,786
Hey, man,

1424
01:14:59,461 --> 01:15:01,486
I gotta say, I like
what you've done with the place.

1425
01:15:01,596 --> 01:15:04,497
Yeah, I like it. I love you, Son.

1426
01:15:04,599 --> 01:15:06,328
I love you, too. Shake on it.

1427
01:15:07,368 --> 01:15:09,666
Why don't you get back
to scaring those fish, buddy? Huh?

1428
01:15:09,771 --> 01:15:10,738
All right.

1429
01:15:11,272 --> 01:15:12,899
Come back anytime, Son.

1430
01:15:13,007 --> 01:15:14,634
Come here. Bucket. Bucket.

1431
01:15:20,114 --> 01:15:21,979
-Hey, Mom.
-Tripp.

1432
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:23,941
You see what's going on upstairs?

1433
01:15:24,152 --> 01:15:26,347
Pop's naked, in his Naked Room.

1434
01:15:26,454 --> 01:15:28,319
I know. He's always wanted one.

1435
01:15:28,423 --> 01:15:29,981
He tried to take over the dining room

1436
01:15:30,091 --> 01:15:32,992
until I convinced him
that the first floor was problematic.

1437
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:36,988
-You okay?
-Yeah.

1438
01:15:37,432 --> 01:15:38,899
Just came by to pick up some clothes.

1439
01:15:42,937 --> 01:15:44,234
I'm sorry.

1440
01:15:46,541 --> 01:15:48,133
It was a lousy thing to do.

1441
01:15:51,713 --> 01:15:53,681
You know, when we first met Paula,

1442
01:15:55,216 --> 01:15:56,774
when we hired her, I...

1443
01:15:57,385 --> 01:15:59,012
I didn't want you to go.

1444
01:16:00,021 --> 01:16:02,546
For years, I've been dreading
the day you'd leave

1445
01:16:02,657 --> 01:16:06,149
and I always thought
it was 'cause I'd miss you so much.

1446
01:16:06,394 --> 01:16:09,362
Then I realized that
that was only part of it.

1447
01:16:09,530 --> 01:16:11,623
I didn't want you to leave because

1448
01:16:12,599 --> 01:16:15,534
being alone with your father
freaks the living shit out of me.

1449
01:16:16,003 --> 01:16:17,903
-What?
-I'm terrified, Tripp!

1450
01:16:18,071 --> 01:16:20,130
And it's not just about the Naked Room.

1451
01:16:20,541 --> 01:16:23,601
Since your father retired, I just...

1452
01:16:24,578 --> 01:16:26,273
I'm used to having you here.

1453
01:16:27,147 --> 01:16:29,377
Like a buffer, you know?
Somebody to talk to

1454
01:16:29,483 --> 01:16:31,951
when your father's all
moody and sullen, and...

1455
01:16:33,387 --> 01:16:34,445
Now I'm...

1456
01:16:34,588 --> 01:16:37,421
We're just gonna have to
get to know each other all over again.

1457
01:16:38,458 --> 01:16:39,584
And...

1458
01:16:43,931 --> 01:16:44,989
What?

1459
01:16:48,802 --> 01:16:50,326
What if he doesn't like me?

1460
01:16:54,174 --> 01:16:55,141
Hey.

1461
01:17:03,550 --> 01:17:05,074
You still love him, right?

1462
01:17:07,254 --> 01:17:08,846
Against all odds.

1463
01:17:10,591 --> 01:17:12,183
Then you'll figure it out.

1464
01:17:16,830 --> 01:17:17,797
Come here.

1465
01:17:18,899 --> 01:17:20,526
Hey.

1466
01:17:27,774 --> 01:17:29,298
You're gonna miss me.

1467
01:17:30,677 --> 01:17:31,666
That's true.

1468
01:17:32,112 --> 01:17:36,412
I called you all here together
because obviously we have a situation.

1469
01:17:36,516 --> 01:17:40,383
I know we all feel some responsibility,
but this isn't about blame,

1470
01:17:40,486 --> 01:17:42,681
it's about finding a solution.

1471
01:17:43,022 --> 01:17:45,115
Two people we love are hurting.

1472
01:17:45,224 --> 01:17:48,022
So let's put on our thinking caps.

1473
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:51,152
Man, this shirt feels
like it weighs 100 pounds.

1474
01:17:51,263 --> 01:17:52,423
Albert!

1475
01:17:54,767 --> 01:17:56,291
Okay, how about this?

1476
01:17:56,902 --> 01:18:01,168
We send flowers to Paula from Tripp,

1477
01:18:01,273 --> 01:18:05,801
and flowers to Tripp from Paula.

1478
01:18:07,847 --> 01:18:11,305
-Then what?
-Then they love each other.

1479
01:18:11,417 --> 01:18:12,816
Oh, Jesus Christ!

1480
01:18:12,918 --> 01:18:14,385
Because of the flowers!

1481
01:18:15,121 --> 01:18:16,418
Thank you, Phillip.

1482
01:18:16,522 --> 01:18:20,822
Now, let's all try to come up with a plan
that's not so idiotic.

1483
01:18:24,764 --> 01:18:25,731
Hey.

1484
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:28,960
Listen,

1485
01:18:31,270 --> 01:18:35,639
I went through all the CDs,
but if you end up with some of mine

1486
01:18:35,741 --> 01:18:37,709
or I end up with some of yours,

1487
01:18:37,810 --> 01:18:39,641
let's just call it even, okay?

1488
01:18:40,212 --> 01:18:41,543
Okay, sure.

1489
01:18:42,148 --> 01:18:43,115
Okay.

1490
01:18:45,217 --> 01:18:46,343
I hate this.

1491
01:18:46,452 --> 01:18:47,749
I know. I do, too.

1492
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:48,987
So...

1493
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:54,787
So let's just get it over with, then.

1494
01:18:58,898 --> 01:19:00,798
Okay, look, I know I'm a girl

1495
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:02,891
and I'm supposed to be better
at this emotional crap

1496
01:19:03,002 --> 01:19:05,061
but I'm not, so I'm just gonna say it.

1497
01:19:05,171 --> 01:19:09,471
I'm sorry that I pointed out to you
that you fell in love with a client

1498
01:19:09,575 --> 01:19:12,008
and that made you go crazy
and turn into a total bitch.

1499
01:19:15,513 --> 01:19:16,480
Wow.

1500
01:19:18,383 --> 01:19:21,147
That must've been really hard
for you to say.

1501
01:19:21,252 --> 01:19:25,211
I thought it was going to be, but I just
kind of breezed right through it.

1502
01:19:27,459 --> 01:19:28,892
Well, thanks.

1503
01:19:29,928 --> 01:19:33,386
And I'm sorry that I pointed out

1504
01:19:33,498 --> 01:19:35,762
that you haven't had a real relationship
for the last five years

1505
01:19:35,867 --> 01:19:37,732
because I'm the only person
who can tolerate

1506
01:19:37,836 --> 01:19:39,736
your bizarre and violent mood swings.

1507
01:19:41,172 --> 01:19:43,003
Oh, thank you!

1508
01:19:46,578 --> 01:19:47,567
Goodbye.

1509
01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:48,907
I'm gonna miss you.

1510
01:19:49,013 --> 01:19:50,378
Yeah, I'm going to miss you, too.

1511
01:19:50,982 --> 01:19:53,143
Can I at least give you
a ride to the airport?

1512
01:19:53,251 --> 01:19:54,275
Sure.

1513
01:19:54,419 --> 01:19:56,216
<i>On the way, let's stop at Phillip's,</i>

1514
01:19:56,321 --> 01:19:59,154
<i>so I can give you back
that sweater of yours that you lost.</i>

1515
01:20:08,333 --> 01:20:10,631
Wow! This is fantastic!

1516
01:20:10,735 --> 01:20:12,566
-Yeah, it's pretty great.
-Wow.

1517
01:20:12,670 --> 01:20:14,865
At this point, we're just waiting
for his mom to kick it

1518
01:20:14,973 --> 01:20:16,565
so we can move upstairs.

1519
01:20:16,775 --> 01:20:18,333
That is a lovely sentiment.

1520
01:20:18,443 --> 01:20:19,569
Go, go, go, go!

1521
01:20:20,378 --> 01:20:21,345
Hey!

1522
01:20:21,746 --> 01:20:23,737
Kit! What are you...

1523
01:20:24,983 --> 01:20:26,416
Oh, hi, fellas.

1524
01:20:27,619 --> 01:20:28,779
-Look in the closet.
-Hey, just look

1525
01:20:28,887 --> 01:20:29,945
-Yeah.
-...right in the closet.

1526
01:20:30,054 --> 01:20:31,078
Why?

1527
01:20:31,189 --> 01:20:32,349
-Huh?
-Go, go, go, go, go!

1528
01:20:32,457 --> 01:20:34,652
Wait! What are you guys doing?

1529
01:20:57,347 --> 01:21:00,248
Sorry. I tried to do it fast
so it wouldn't hurt.

1530
01:21:00,350 --> 01:21:02,250
You were concerned about hurting me?

1531
01:21:03,053 --> 01:21:04,611
That's a refreshing change of pace.

1532
01:21:04,788 --> 01:21:07,313
Listen, I say there's no downside.
They already hate each other.

1533
01:21:07,424 --> 01:21:08,413
I wonder how they're doing.

1534
01:21:08,525 --> 01:21:09,822
Whoa, whoa, hold on just a second.

1535
01:21:09,927 --> 01:21:11,758
Let's check, shall we?

1536
01:21:14,665 --> 01:21:16,462
Okay, watch this.

1537
01:21:20,003 --> 01:21:24,167
Is this how it's gonna be?
'Cause your note says,

1538
01:21:24,274 --> 01:21:26,333
"Hi, we need to talk."

1539
01:21:26,443 --> 01:21:27,933
Yeah, I wrote that.

1540
01:21:28,111 --> 01:21:32,138
Right after I tied myself to the chair
and covered my mouth with duct tape.

1541
01:21:32,249 --> 01:21:34,513
-So you don't want to talk.
-To you?

1542
01:21:36,186 --> 01:21:37,483
I'll pass.

1543
01:21:40,858 --> 01:21:42,985
I can't see her face.
Do you have any other angles?

1544
01:21:43,093 --> 01:21:44,685
Of course I have angles. Check it out.

1545
01:21:45,495 --> 01:21:49,932
I installed 27 cameras that cover
every inch of the apartment.

1546
01:21:50,601 --> 01:21:52,535
-Were these up last night?
-Yeah.

1547
01:21:53,003 --> 01:21:53,970
No.

1548
01:21:55,372 --> 01:21:56,737
I helped tie the knots.

1549
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:58,671
The one on his feet
is called an Anchor Hitch.

1550
01:21:58,775 --> 01:22:00,242
I could get out of those ropes.

1551
01:22:00,344 --> 01:22:01,811
You can't get out
of your barbecue apron.

1552
01:22:04,648 --> 01:22:07,242
This is ridiculous,
not to mention juvenile.

1553
01:22:07,351 --> 01:22:10,218
We can't just sit here
and not say anything.

1554
01:22:12,623 --> 01:22:14,715
All right, fine. I'll start.

1555
01:22:15,925 --> 01:22:18,018
I think you're being a jackass.

1556
01:22:21,364 --> 01:22:25,300
I think those pants make you look fat,
but in a sexy...

1557
01:22:26,836 --> 01:22:28,963
-I don't get it.
-I told you this was a stupid idea.

1558
01:22:29,538 --> 01:22:30,505
Hey.

1559
01:22:31,674 --> 01:22:32,936
We should have done the flowers.

1560
01:22:33,042 --> 01:22:36,068
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
She's going to say something.

1561
01:22:38,014 --> 01:22:39,572
Tripp, I apologize.

1562
01:22:40,383 --> 01:22:43,841
My job was manipulative and deceitful.

1563
01:22:43,953 --> 01:22:47,912
But the second that I found out
about Amy, I was gonna end it.

1564
01:22:48,925 --> 01:22:51,917
But I never got the chance,
because you found out first.

1565
01:23:02,038 --> 01:23:02,772
Sorry. Sorry.

1566
01:23:02,772 --> 01:23:04,740
Sorry. Sorry.

1567
01:23:10,179 --> 01:23:11,578
Apology accepted.

1568
01:23:11,981 --> 01:23:13,073
Thank you.

1569
01:23:14,817 --> 01:23:17,718
Come on.
You don't want to say anything?

1570
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:20,414
-You know, I do have a question.
-Absolutely. Anything.

1571
01:23:21,324 --> 01:23:23,815
How many others were there?
Before me.

1572
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:26,924
I'm just asking, 'cause, you know,
maybe we could all get together.

1573
01:23:27,029 --> 01:23:28,519
You know, form a support group.

1574
01:23:28,631 --> 01:23:30,963
And if there already is a group,
I'm curious,

1575
01:23:31,067 --> 01:23:33,160
is it a small group,
like a basketball team?

1576
01:23:33,269 --> 01:23:34,861
Or is it a big group,

1577
01:23:35,871 --> 01:23:37,099
like the Chinese?

1578
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:39,298
Wow. Somebody's a little cranky today.

1579
01:23:39,408 --> 01:23:43,208
Tripp, your mother was still making you
pancakes for breakfast.

1580
01:23:43,312 --> 01:23:46,007
And it's not as if
I waltzed into your life unbidden.

1581
01:23:46,114 --> 01:23:47,979
Your parents called me.

1582
01:23:48,249 --> 01:23:51,218
Your life was in
an extended stall pattern.

1583
01:23:51,319 --> 01:23:52,911
I wish I could talk to guys like that.

1584
01:23:53,021 --> 01:23:55,012
Well, it's easier when the guy is tied up.

1585
01:23:55,123 --> 01:23:58,354
No, I've talked to guys tied up before.

1586
01:24:00,962 --> 01:24:02,987
You want to talk about my life?
What about your life?

1587
01:24:03,131 --> 01:24:04,462
Hey, but maybe I shouldn't judge.

1588
01:24:04,566 --> 01:24:07,433
I'm sure there's some reason
that you turned out to be a soul-sucking,

1589
01:24:07,535 --> 01:24:09,730
Labrador-retriever-killing harpy.

1590
01:24:09,838 --> 01:24:11,931
I don't get it.
How does the dog fit into it?

1591
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:13,439
-Good question.
-Can you turn it up?

1592
01:24:13,775 --> 01:24:16,744
Well, they're laptop speakers, so...

1593
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:20,408
Unless...

1594
01:24:22,117 --> 01:24:23,914
I was doing fine before you showed up.

1595
01:24:24,519 --> 01:24:25,747
All right? I was having fun.

1596
01:24:25,854 --> 01:24:27,481
Oh, and I just ruined everything!

1597
01:24:27,956 --> 01:24:30,049
So is that why you tried
to break up with me?

1598
01:24:30,158 --> 01:24:32,854
Or actually, you didn't.
You just trotted out your parents

1599
01:24:32,961 --> 01:24:35,259
so that I would have
to break up with you.

1600
01:24:35,363 --> 01:24:37,991
-Oh, snap!
-That got his attention!

1601
01:24:38,099 --> 01:24:41,432
That's right, you call her on her shit,
she's gonna call you on yours!

1602
01:24:41,536 --> 01:24:44,699
What are you going to do, baby?
Are you gonna cry?

1603
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:46,664
Sorry.

1604
01:24:47,542 --> 01:24:49,533
Why would you do that?

1605
01:24:51,346 --> 01:24:52,540
Because

1606
01:24:53,748 --> 01:24:55,238
you gave me "the look."

1607
01:24:55,350 --> 01:24:57,375
-Not "the look."
-Why are you bringing up "the look"?

1608
01:24:57,485 --> 01:24:58,474
What's "the look"?

1609
01:24:58,787 --> 01:25:03,349
The look that says, "Hey, I like you."

1610
01:25:03,858 --> 01:25:05,189
Oh, wow.

1611
01:25:07,128 --> 01:25:09,358
That must've been horrible for you.

1612
01:25:09,631 --> 01:25:10,723
Do I do "the look"?

1613
01:25:10,832 --> 01:25:11,821
Well, yeah.

1614
01:25:12,033 --> 01:25:13,000
Well, no.

1615
01:25:13,668 --> 01:25:15,362
I never meant to hurt you.

1616
01:25:19,106 --> 01:25:22,405
I believe that.
But what do I know about you?

1617
01:25:22,676 --> 01:25:27,079
I mean, the entire amount of time
we spent together was just a big scam.

1618
01:25:28,348 --> 01:25:33,047
I found a woman I cared about,
and she turned out to be a total fraud.

1619
01:25:36,457 --> 01:25:38,254
Do you have real feelings?

1620
01:25:38,959 --> 01:25:41,086
Of course I have real feelings.

1621
01:25:41,195 --> 01:25:43,629
-For what?
-For you!

1622
01:25:44,431 --> 01:25:46,456
And believe me, I did not want that,

1623
01:25:46,567 --> 01:25:49,263
because I had a good life before you.

1624
01:25:49,903 --> 01:25:52,963
Well, not good, but it was okay.

1625
01:25:54,274 --> 01:25:56,572
Well, it was empty, actually,

1626
01:25:56,677 --> 01:26:00,545
but at least I was blissfully unaware
of how miserable I was!

1627
01:26:00,647 --> 01:26:03,445
Whereas now, because of you,

1628
01:26:03,951 --> 01:26:06,078
I am acutely aware

1629
01:26:06,186 --> 01:26:09,451
of how completely
and totally unhappy I am!

1630
01:26:12,860 --> 01:26:14,191
Thank you for that.

1631
01:26:22,536 --> 01:26:26,131
I don't usually like reality TV shows,
but this is so emotional.

1632
01:26:26,773 --> 01:26:28,400
Are you crying?

1633
01:26:30,644 --> 01:26:31,633
Come on, Tripp.

1634
01:26:51,731 --> 01:26:52,789
He's moving.

1635
01:26:52,899 --> 01:26:54,491
He's rolling. Here we go.

1636
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:56,124
He's making a move! All right!

1637
01:26:56,235 --> 01:26:57,998
He's moving his feet! He's rolling!

1638
01:26:58,104 --> 01:26:59,628
-Go! Go!
-Go!

1639
01:26:59,739 --> 01:27:01,331
Oh, my God! He could

1640
01:27:01,474 --> 01:27:02,998
-go all the way!
-Go all the way!

1641
01:27:03,109 --> 01:27:06,601
Don't do all the work, Son!
Make her meet you half way!

1642
01:27:13,619 --> 01:27:15,177
So what do we do now?

1643
01:27:20,660 --> 01:27:22,958
Actually, it's quite simple.

1644
01:27:23,062 --> 01:27:25,553
You just have to decide.

1645
01:27:26,299 --> 01:27:28,893
Do you want to spend
the rest of your life having fun?

1646
01:27:29,001 --> 01:27:31,026
Or do you want to spend it with me?

1647
01:27:32,171 --> 01:27:35,231
Shut up.
Not everything you say is perfect.

1648
01:27:35,341 --> 01:27:38,139
We can have a little bit of fun, can't we?

1649
01:27:47,253 --> 01:27:48,220
Right on, man!

1650
01:27:49,088 --> 01:27:50,055
All right!

1651
01:27:51,057 --> 01:27:52,024
Yeah!

1652
01:28:00,733 --> 01:28:01,791
Hallelujah!

1653
01:28:05,471 --> 01:28:07,268
Show's over. You don't need to see that.

1654
01:28:07,373 --> 01:28:09,500
Come on, let's you and I
go outside, huh?

1655
01:28:09,609 --> 01:28:11,668
Play some football.
I'll show you how to throw it deep.

1656
01:28:11,777 --> 01:28:14,109
After, I'll show you
how to ice your shoulder down.

1657
01:28:24,956 --> 01:28:26,287
Give you a hand?

1658
01:28:26,391 --> 01:28:29,326
You just take it easy.
I got everything under control.

1659
01:28:29,461 --> 01:28:31,793
Hey, what's the champagne about?

1660
01:28:31,930 --> 01:28:33,192
It's Thursday.

1661
01:28:38,536 --> 01:28:39,594
Thank you.

1662
01:28:41,273 --> 01:28:42,467
You're welcome.

1663
01:28:43,041 --> 01:28:44,030
Cheers.

1664
01:28:50,282 --> 01:28:53,251
All right, Captain,
where are we heading?

1665
01:28:56,821 --> 01:28:58,686
There's a lighthouse!
Can we go over there?

1666
01:28:59,157 --> 01:29:01,091
Sure. You're driving.

1667
01:29:07,899 --> 01:29:10,197
Tripp! Jibe ho! God, I said it late!

1668
01:29:10,302 --> 01:29:11,428
I'm sorry!

1669
01:29:16,708 --> 01:29:18,699
-Tripp!
-What happened to "jibe ho"?

1670
01:29:18,810 --> 01:29:20,607
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

1671
01:29:20,712 --> 01:29:23,545
Yeah. Just got the wind
knocked out of me.

1672
01:29:23,648 --> 01:29:25,582
Maybe a collapsed lung,
a bruised sternum.

1673
01:29:25,684 --> 01:29:27,515
Other than that, I'll survive.

1674
01:29:27,619 --> 01:29:30,315
I'm going to get you
a flotation device, okay?

1675
01:29:30,422 --> 01:29:31,389
Yeah.

1676
01:29:32,624 --> 01:29:33,852
Stay right there.

1677
01:29:34,225 --> 01:29:35,920
That's a good idea.

1678
01:29:38,263 --> 01:29:39,423
Oh, shit.

1679
01:29:41,099 --> 01:29:42,430
Oh, shit!

1680
01:29:42,734 --> 01:29:46,295
No biting! No biting. No bite, no bite.
No, no, no, no...

1681
01:29:54,244 --> 01:29:55,211
Good boy.

1682
01:29:55,713 --> 01:29:56,771
Come here, you.

1683
01:29:57,281 --> 01:29:59,272
Yeah. Yeah.

1684
01:29:59,883 --> 01:30:01,441
That's it. Okay.

1685
01:30:01,552 --> 01:30:03,179
Here! I...

1686
01:30:04,054 --> 01:30:05,681
Oh, my God!

1687
01:30:05,789 --> 01:30:06,756
Yeah.

1688
01:30:07,591 --> 01:30:09,081
That's amazing.

1689
01:30:11,228 --> 01:30:13,526
What do you say, big man, huh?

1690
01:30:21,905 --> 01:30:25,306
Hey, still need this?

1691
01:30:28,379 --> 01:30:29,812
No, I'm good.

1692
01:30:32,916 --> 01:30:34,008
I'm real good.

1693
01:30:34,852 --> 01:30:35,819
Okay.

1694
01:30:59,009 --> 01:31:01,000
Honey, it's an Eastern Wood-Pewee.

1695
01:31:01,111 --> 01:31:02,100
Eastern Wood-Pewee?

1696
01:31:02,212 --> 01:31:04,339
You couldn't be more wrong
if you called it a Canadian goose.

1697
01:31:08,519 --> 01:31:10,316
I'll give you a Canadian goose.

1698
01:31:25,134 --> 01:31:26,192
Look!

1699
01:31:30,306 --> 01:31:31,796
He's so tame.

1700
01:31:31,908 --> 01:31:34,809
Yeah. See, once we accept the fact
that we're not separate from nature,

1701
01:31:34,911 --> 01:31:36,572
she welcomes us. And it's not with fear.

1702
01:31:36,679 --> 01:31:38,374
Right? Who do you love?

1703
01:31:43,152 --> 01:31:44,744
<i>Hit the road, Tripp</i>

1704
01:31:44,854 --> 01:31:46,287
<i>-And don't you come back
-And don't you come back</i>

1705
01:31:46,389 --> 01:31:49,552
<i>-...no more, no more, no more, no more
-...no more, no more, no more, no more</i>

1706
01:31:49,659 --> 01:31:51,217
<i>-Hit the road, Tripp
-Hit the road, Tripp</i>

1707
01:31:51,327 --> 01:31:54,490
<i>-And don't you come back no more
-And don't you come back no more</i>

1708
01:31:54,597 --> 01:31:55,791
<i>What'd I say?</i>
