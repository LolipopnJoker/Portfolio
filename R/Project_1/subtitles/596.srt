00:01:10,934 --> 00:01:14,229
Carmen, Juni, time for bed.

4
00:01:14,271 --> 00:01:16,857
- Did you brush your teeth?
- I already did.

5
00:01:19,943 --> 00:01:22,362
- Juni, don't forget to brush--
- I am, I am.

6
00:01:22,404 --> 00:01:24,990
All right, all right.

7
00:01:25,031 --> 00:01:28,493
JUNI: OK, warts. Uhh!

8
00:01:28,577 --> 00:01:31,997
Prepare to meet your maker.

9
00:01:33,999 --> 00:01:36,751
Everything OK at school?

10
00:01:36,793 --> 00:01:40,172
Yeah. It's good. It's fine.

11
00:01:40,255 --> 00:01:44,009
OK. Well, lights out.

12
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,969
Bedtime story first.

13
00:01:46,011 --> 00:01:47,804
What story do you want to hear?

14
00:01:47,846 --> 00:01:50,724
"The Two Spies
Who Fell In Love."

15
00:01:50,765 --> 00:01:52,767
Hmm. Wow.

16
00:01:52,767 --> 00:01:56,062
I haven't told that one
in a while.

17
00:01:56,104 --> 00:01:59,149
You probably remember that
better than I do.

18
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:02,652
- Want to hear a story, Juni?
- I'm listening.

19
00:02:02,694 --> 00:02:04,654
OK.

20
00:02:04,696 --> 00:02:06,656
Once upon a time...

21
00:02:06,698 --> 00:02:09,284
there was a man and a woman.

22
00:02:09,326 --> 00:02:11,578
- And they were both spies.
- Yes.

23
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,580
She from one country,
he from another.

24
00:02:13,622 --> 00:02:17,083
She had a very important mission
assigned to her.

25
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:19,503
- He was her mission.
- Correct.

26
00:02:19,544 --> 00:02:22,255
Her mission was to take him out.

27
00:02:22,297 --> 00:02:24,174
CARMEN: On a date?

28
00:02:24,216 --> 00:02:27,427
No. Uh, take him--

29
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:29,054
Oh, you mean...

30
00:02:29,095 --> 00:02:30,305
I shouldn't be telling you this.

31
00:02:30,347 --> 00:02:32,599
- Go on. Go on.
- You have to understand...

32
00:02:32,641 --> 00:02:34,100
these were
dark and confusing times.

33
00:02:34,142 --> 00:02:37,187
An enormous amount of turmoil
between countries.

34
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:38,396
INGRID: Out off ear...

35
00:02:38,438 --> 00:02:40,690
a new kind of soldier
was created--

36
00:02:40,732 --> 00:02:43,276
brilliant, brave soldiers...

37
00:02:43,276 --> 00:02:47,280
whose greatest weapons
were their minds.

38
00:02:47,364 --> 00:02:51,743
Those men and women were spies.

39
00:03:11,012 --> 00:03:13,139
They were masters of disguise.

40
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:16,268
They could sense danger
a mile away...

41
00:03:16,351 --> 00:03:17,936
and through their work...

42
00:03:17,978 --> 00:03:20,939
wars were ended
before they even started.

43
00:03:21,022 --> 00:03:22,983
[Electronic beeping]

44
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:29,573
The only things spies
were truly afraid of...

45
00:03:29,614 --> 00:03:31,950
were other spies--

46
00:03:31,992 --> 00:03:34,327
enemy spies.

47
00:03:34,369 --> 00:03:37,122
So, sometimes,
one spy's mission...

48
00:03:37,163 --> 00:03:40,500
was to make
the enemy disappear.

49
00:03:40,542 --> 00:03:45,338
He was the assignment
that changed her life...

50
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,507
but when the moment
finally came...

51
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:48,842
to carry out her mission...

52
00:03:53,638 --> 00:03:55,473
she couldn't do it.

53
00:03:57,726 --> 00:04:00,645
He was different
than she expected.

54
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:07,652
Sure, he was charming
and intelligent...

55
00:04:09,404 --> 00:04:12,824
but he was
unexpectedly honorable...

56
00:04:12,866 --> 00:04:14,326
and it made her realize...

57
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:16,578
how years of working
with detached emotion...

58
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,039
had taken its toll.

59
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,875
So they kept contact...

60
00:04:21,917 --> 00:04:25,212
through lunch dates--
very discreet.

61
00:04:25,253 --> 00:04:26,963
After all,
they were on different sides...

62
00:04:27,047 --> 00:04:29,299
so they could never
be seen together.

63
00:04:29,382 --> 00:04:30,842
Dinner dates followed...

64
00:04:30,884 --> 00:04:32,844
wherever their mutual
travels took them.

65
00:04:32,928 --> 00:04:34,888
And they fell in love...

66
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,015
and they decided
that, together...

67
00:04:37,057 --> 00:04:38,850
they would embark...

68
00:04:38,892 --> 00:04:41,728
on the most dangerous mission
of all time.

69
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:42,938
CARMEN: What?

70
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:45,232
INGRID: They decided to marry.

71
00:04:45,273 --> 00:04:46,566
CARMEN: Wow.

72
00:04:46,608 --> 00:04:48,902
INGRID: Oh, yes.
On her wedding day...

73
00:04:48,944 --> 00:04:50,362
she felt like
she would rather brave...

74
00:04:50,403 --> 00:04:52,072
a thousand deadly missions...

75
00:04:52,113 --> 00:04:53,823
than go through with what
she was about to attempt.

76
00:04:53,865 --> 00:04:55,992
CARMEN: Why is that?

77
00:04:56,034 --> 00:04:58,119
Well, marriage is a mission
so complex...

78
00:04:58,161 --> 00:05:02,999
that only the most courageous
and slightly insane need apply.

79
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,043
There's such an amazing
series of obstacles...

80
00:05:05,126 --> 00:05:07,504
one has to navigate
to keep a marriage together--

81
00:05:07,546 --> 00:05:08,713
much less family--

82
00:05:08,755 --> 00:05:11,216
that it frightened even her...

83
00:05:11,299 --> 00:05:14,511
a hardened
and experienced secret agent.

84
00:05:14,553 --> 00:05:16,263
But when she saw him...

85
00:05:16,304 --> 00:05:20,809
standing there
with no doubt whatsoever...

86
00:05:20,851 --> 00:05:23,103
so assured of his decision...

87
00:05:23,144 --> 00:05:26,273
so enamored with what
they were about to do...

88
00:05:26,314 --> 00:05:28,275
she took his hand...

89
00:05:28,316 --> 00:05:31,278
looked deep into his eyes...

90
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:33,780
and said
the two most dangerous...

91
00:05:33,864 --> 00:05:36,783
most trusting words
you can say to anyone.

92
00:05:36,825 --> 00:05:37,909
CARMEN: What?

93
00:05:37,993 --> 00:05:41,079
INGRID: She said, "I do. "

94
00:05:41,162 --> 00:05:43,248
CARMEN: Oh, that's so cool.

95
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,585
Yeah.
Then the problems started.

[Plane engine roars]

97
00:05:49,671 --> 00:05:51,798
INGRID: Now, there was
always some faction...

98
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,842
that wanted at least
one of them gone.

99
00:05:53,842 --> 00:05:56,636
On their own,
each agent was notorious...

100
00:05:56,678 --> 00:05:59,139
but together,
they made tempting targets.

101

[No audio]

102
00:06:43,558 --> 00:06:45,185

105
00:06:48,396 --> 00:06:50,148
In a way, they exchanged...

106
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,691
one life of adventure
for another...

107
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:53,693
trading espionage
for parenthood--

108
00:06:53,735 --> 00:06:57,531
a mysterious and compelling
mission in its own right.

109
00:06:57,572 --> 00:07:01,368
And they're better off.
The end.

110
00:07:01,409 --> 00:07:03,245
No "happily ever after"?

111
00:07:03,286 --> 00:07:05,205
I said they were better off.

112
00:07:05,247 --> 00:07:08,708
Great story, Mom,
but it needs a new ending.

113
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,126
It needs monsters.

114
00:07:10,168 --> 00:07:11,628
INGRID: Is that right?

115
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,255
Do you want me to look at your--

116
00:07:13,338 --> 00:07:15,924
I put the medicine on.

OK, munchkin. Good night.

119

Mmm. Ours.

120

How many nights, I wonder...

121
00:07:35,318 --> 00:07:38,029
do you send the children
off to bed with nightmares?

I was expecting something...

its research...

565

We all have our reasons, hmm?

567
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:25,452
There was someone else
on that research team, hmm?

who could rebuild it.

00:53:51,928 --> 00:53:54,723
I think we all
have uncles like that.

900
00:53:54,764 --> 00:53:57,851
"Another fine Machete product."

901
00:53:57,893 --> 00:54:02,355
You make the best spy inventions
in the world.

902
00:54:02,397 --> 00:54:03,732
MA CHETE: That's correct.

903
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:06,443
CARMEN: But you sell them
to both sides, good and bad.

904
00:54:06,485 --> 00:54:09,279
That's why Dad hasn't spoken
of you in all these years.

905
00:54:10,405 --> 00:54:12,574
JUNI: Ever sell stuff to Floop?

906
00:54:14,117 --> 00:54:15,243
Why?

907
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:16,369
CARMEN: Our Mom and Dad--

908
00:54:16,411 --> 00:54:18,455
your brother--
are his prisoners...

909
00:54:18,455 --> 00:54:20,415
and if we don't
do something to help...

910
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:23,502
something really bad's
gonna happen to them.

911
00:54:23,585 --> 00:54:25,045
I don't see why
you won't help him !

912
00:54:25,045 --> 00:54:27,881
You think I want to baby-sit
my brother the rest of my life?

913
00:54:27,881 --> 00:54:29,883
"Watch out for Gregorio.
Take care of Gregorio.

914
00:54:29,883 --> 00:54:31,718
"Make sure Gregorio
knows right from wrong."

915
00:54:31,718 --> 00:54:32,844
Not anymore.

916
00:54:32,886 --> 00:54:36,515
Machete's not responsible
for nobody but Machete.

917
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:39,726
But that's not what family is.

918
00:54:39,768 --> 00:54:42,395
We're just brothers.
Cain and Abel were brothers.

919
00:54:42,437 --> 00:54:44,523
Look how they ended up.

920
00:54:46,233 --> 00:54:47,859
Now, the only thing
that will get you...

921
00:54:47,901 --> 00:54:51,029
to Floop's castle fast enough...

922
00:54:51,071 --> 00:54:53,281
is this.

923
00:54:53,365 --> 00:54:54,783
It's tiny.

924
00:54:54,825 --> 00:54:57,452
It's built for one passenger,
but it's fast.

925
00:54:57,536 --> 00:54:59,329
Will you go?

926
00:54:59,371 --> 00:55:00,580
No.

927
00:55:00,622 --> 00:55:03,500
- For your brother?
- No!

928
00:55:03,542 --> 00:55:06,419
Then how about for us...
your niece and nephew?

929
00:55:07,754 --> 00:55:08,713
No.

930
00:55:14,427 --> 00:55:18,265
- How about if--
- No! No! A million times no!

931
00:55:18,265 --> 00:55:20,267
Pass the pig intestines.

932
00:55:24,354 --> 00:55:26,982
I'm not eating that now. Nope.

933
00:55:28,441 --> 00:55:30,694
- Can I have a--
- No!

934
00:55:30,735 --> 00:55:32,404
Glass of water?

935
00:55:32,445 --> 00:55:34,739
Thank you for letting us
stay here...

936
00:55:34,781 --> 00:55:37,159
while we ponder
our parents' terrible fate.

937
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,871
If you weren't a Cortez,
I wouldn't be doing this much.

938
00:55:40,912 --> 00:55:43,081
So family does mean more to you
than money.

939
00:55:45,876 --> 00:55:47,127
No.

940
00:55:47,169 --> 00:55:49,629
Dad misses you, too.

941
00:55:58,763 --> 00:56:00,891
Ready?

942
00:56:00,974 --> 00:56:02,434
Let's go.

943
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:09,441
CARMEN: Now we're talkin'.

944
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:14,279
[Snoring]

945
00:56:14,321 --> 00:56:16,573
[Whispering]
What are you doing?

946
00:56:16,615 --> 00:56:18,617
Getting the map
to Floop's castle.

947
00:56:20,285 --> 00:56:23,079
Shh. It's just a reflex.

948
00:56:23,121 --> 00:56:24,831
Look. He's still asleep.

949
00:56:24,873 --> 00:56:26,958
[Snores loudly]

950
00:56:29,961 --> 00:56:32,339
[Snoring]

951
00:56:36,551 --> 00:56:40,388
Never send an adult
to do a kid's job.

952
00:56:44,726 --> 00:56:46,812
CARMEN: Oh, yeah.

953
00:56:52,234 --> 00:56:54,569
What can I do to help?

954
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:57,239
Remember that spy plane
up on the roof?

955
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,199
Yeah.

956
00:56:59,241 --> 00:57:01,368
Start reading.

957
00:57:01,409 --> 00:57:03,620
Oh. Homework.

958
00:57:03,662 --> 00:57:05,121
[Rooster crows]

959
00:57:05,205 --> 00:57:07,374
[Groans]

960
00:57:07,457 --> 00:57:10,126
[Engines warming up]

961
00:57:14,756 --> 00:57:15,966
No!

962
00:57:17,092 --> 00:57:19,970
CARMEN: Hurry up!
He's coming ! He's coming !

963
00:57:22,514 --> 00:57:24,349
JUNI: Good-bye, Uncle Machete!

964
00:57:24,391 --> 00:57:25,725
CARMEN: Thanks for the plane!

965
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:48,957
CARMEN:
OK, so here's the new plan.

966
00:57:48,999 --> 00:57:50,500
We get to the castle,
rescue Mom and Dad...

967
00:57:50,542 --> 00:57:51,835
then somehow stop Floop...

968
00:57:51,877 --> 00:57:53,712
from using the brain
on the robots...

969
00:57:53,753 --> 00:57:56,506
before they're sent out
to dominate the world.

970
00:57:56,548 --> 00:57:59,426
- Think we can do that?
- How hard could it be?

971
00:57:59,467 --> 00:58:01,761
[Alarms sounding]

972
00:58:03,138 --> 00:58:04,931
I didn't do anything.

973
00:58:04,973 --> 00:58:09,060
OK. Airspeed--fine.
Altitude--fine.

974
00:58:09,102 --> 00:58:11,813
CARMEN: Autopilot...failing?

975
00:58:11,897 --> 00:58:15,275
Oh, great.
Another fine Machete product.

976
00:58:15,275 --> 00:58:17,319
Take control.
We have to go to manual.

977
00:58:17,402 --> 00:58:19,237
Now!

978
00:58:19,279 --> 00:58:22,073
CARMEN: You were supposed
to read all the instructions!

979
00:58:24,201 --> 00:58:26,161
You skipped a chapter, meathead.

980
00:58:26,203 --> 00:58:28,663
Better stop calling me names.

981
00:58:28,705 --> 00:58:30,373
Pull up, booger breath !

982
00:58:30,415 --> 00:58:32,125
Stop it or I'll call you names.

983
00:58:32,167 --> 00:58:34,961
CARMEN: Go ahead.
You got nothin' on me, warthog.

984
00:58:35,003 --> 00:58:39,549
Try me...diaper lady.

985
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:43,762
Aha.
Hope you're wearing one now.

986
00:58:43,803 --> 00:58:46,932
- How long have you known?
- Since forever.

987
00:58:46,973 --> 00:58:49,392
Mom made me swear
not to mention it.

988
00:58:49,434 --> 00:58:52,270
So now we're even !

989
00:58:52,312 --> 00:58:54,523
CARMEN: Oh, now you've done it!

990
00:58:54,564 --> 00:58:57,776
I knew this was gonna happen !

991
00:58:57,818 --> 00:59:00,362
We're gonna crash
if you don't do something !

992
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,325
CARMEN: You did that
on purpose, you kamikaze!

993
00:59:05,367 --> 00:59:08,161
JUNI: But now it's balanced!

994
00:59:08,203 --> 00:59:09,538
Landing gear.

995
00:59:12,123 --> 00:59:14,543
No landing gear.
We're gonna crash !

996
00:59:15,544 --> 00:59:17,921
CARMEN:
Nope. We're gonna drop.

997
00:59:17,963 --> 00:59:19,381
Get your regulator ready.

998
00:59:36,773 --> 00:59:40,193
Com systems check.
Can you hear me?

999
00:59:40,235 --> 00:59:41,236
Yeah.

1000
00:59:41,278 --> 00:59:45,115
Let's try that cave over there.

1001
00:59:46,616 --> 00:59:49,578
CARMEN:
The water's warmer in here.

1002
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:51,788
JUNI: Oh, I just peed.

1003
00:59:51,830 --> 00:59:54,166
- Ecch.
- Sorry.

1004
01:03:03,959 --> 01:03:05,937
A Thumb-thumb.

1005
01:03:05,979 --> 01:03:07,689
A real live--

1006
01:03:30,295 --> 01:03:33,673
What did you do to him?

1007
01:03:33,715 --> 01:03:35,759
Machete's electroshock gumballs.

1008
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:38,887
It says long lasting.
But I don't trust wrappers.

1009
01:03:50,065 --> 01:03:51,024
Come on.

1010
01:03:58,949 --> 01:04:01,618
CARMEN:
Over here. Juni, come on.

1011
01:04:05,413 --> 01:04:07,249
What are you doing?

1012
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:08,875
World's smallest cameras.

1013
01:04:08,917 --> 01:04:12,295
I just placed them
all over the main hallways.

1014
01:04:13,463 --> 01:04:15,632
- Sweet.
- Thanks.

1015
01:04:15,674 --> 01:04:20,428
Thumb-thumbs and Fooglies
coming up the south hall.

1016
01:04:23,139 --> 01:04:24,599
Got an idea?

1017
01:04:24,641 --> 01:04:26,226
Yeah.

1018
01:04:39,156 --> 01:04:40,824
JUNI: Agent Donnagon?

1019
01:04:40,866 --> 01:04:44,703
[Speaking backwards]

1020
01:04:44,744 --> 01:04:46,997
Where's my mom and dad?

1021
01:04:48,582 --> 01:04:51,126
[Speaking backwards]

1022
01:04:51,168 --> 01:04:52,419
Thanks.

- I got it.
- What'd he say?

1024
01:04:57,674 --> 01:04:58,633
I'll play it backwards.

1025

DONNAGON:
They're in the dungeon. Hurry.

1026
01:05:00,969 --> 01:05:02,429
See if they know
where the Brain room is.

1027
01:05:06,308 --> 01:05:07,726
Uh-oh.

1028
01:05:07,767 --> 01:05:10,145
Thumb-thumbs--everywhere.

1029
01:05:10,187 --> 01:05:11,646
Let's see if they like bubbles.

1030
01:05:23,992 --> 01:05:26,912
We'll be back for you,
fellow agents.

1031
01:05:26,953 --> 01:05:28,455
Sknaht!

1032
01:05:28,538 --> 01:05:30,415
[Jabbering excitedly]

1033

MINION ON P.A.:
All robots please report...

1034
01:05:32,542 --> 01:05:36,505
to docking bays four, five,
and six for immediate loading.

1035
01:05:36,588 --> 01:05:39,049
This is the ventilator shaft
here.

1036
01:05:39,090 --> 01:05:42,219
CARMEN: But the dungeon's on
the other side of the castle.

1037
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:44,971
How do we get there undetected?

1038
01:05:57,025 --> 01:05:58,735
[Whispering] I think
they've gotten smarter...

1039
01:05:58,777 --> 01:05:59,986
since the last time we met.

1040
01:06:00,028 --> 01:06:01,404
Intruder.

intruder, intruder,
intruder, intruder...

1043
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:16,044
- Can you make it?
- I think so.

1044
01:06:16,086 --> 01:06:18,547
Come on. Come on !

1045
01:06:19,548 --> 01:06:23,176
- Carmen !
- Find Mom and Dad !

1046
01:06:33,812 --> 01:06:35,272
I hope this leads
to the dungeon.

1047
01:06:43,613 --> 01:06:44,823
FLOOP: You there.

1048
01:06:44,865 --> 01:06:48,910
What's that on your hands?

1049
01:06:52,372 --> 01:06:54,749
FLOOP: Warts, aren't they?

1050
01:06:54,791 --> 01:06:56,293
Oh, great.

1051
01:06:56,334 --> 01:06:59,421
From sweaty hands sprout warts.

1052
01:06:59,462 --> 01:07:02,424
FLOOP: Do you know why
you have sweaty hands?

1053
01:07:02,465 --> 01:07:04,593
From being scared all the time.

1054
01:07:06,970 --> 01:07:09,389
You don't look
very scared to me.

1055
01:07:09,472 --> 01:07:12,976
That's because I'm mad.
You kidnapped my parents...

1056
01:07:13,059 --> 01:07:17,147
made psycho robot children,
and swallowed up my sister.

1057
01:07:17,189 --> 01:07:18,982
But I didn't want any of that.

1058
01:07:19,024 --> 01:07:22,903
- I thought Floop was a genius.
- You did?

1059
01:07:27,407 --> 01:07:29,618
You watch my show?

1060
01:07:29,659 --> 01:07:31,411
More than you know.

1061
01:07:35,248 --> 01:07:37,584
Alexander Minion.

1062
01:07:37,626 --> 01:07:39,794
Agent Cortez.

1063
01:07:39,836 --> 01:07:41,796
Wonderful to see you again.

1064
01:07:41,838 --> 01:07:44,549
- You know him?
- Yeah.

1065
01:07:44,633 --> 01:07:46,551
He was on
the Third Brain Project...

1066
01:07:46,635 --> 01:07:49,054
until I noticed
he was trying to inject...

1067
01:07:49,095 --> 01:07:51,890
his own ideas into the system.

1068
01:07:51,932 --> 01:07:53,642
I turned him in.

1069
01:07:53,683 --> 01:07:56,228
He was thrown out of the OSS.

1070
01:07:56,269 --> 01:08:00,398
MINION: I'm afraid I'm not
nearly the artist Floop is.

1071
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:02,067
But not to worry.

1072
01:08:02,108 --> 01:08:04,736
I have something else in mind.

1073
01:08:08,532 --> 01:08:11,201
What do you think you're going
to accomplish by doing this?

1074
01:08:11,243 --> 01:08:12,953
Well, you see, Mrs. Cortez...

1075
01:08:12,994 --> 01:08:16,373
I've always been methodical,
goal oriented.

1076
01:08:16,414 --> 01:08:17,833
Psychotically so.

1077
01:08:17,874 --> 01:08:20,335
I'm not afraid of you, Alex.

1078
01:08:20,418 --> 01:08:22,504
So I think it's refreshing...

1079
01:08:22,546 --> 01:08:25,382
to every once in a while...

1080
01:08:25,382 --> 01:08:27,884
have some fun.

1081
01:08:27,926 --> 01:08:29,469
MINION: Oh, and don't worry
about your little brats.

1082
01:08:29,511 --> 01:08:31,555
They'll still be able
to see you.

1083
01:08:31,596 --> 01:08:34,933
Every weekday morning
between 7:30 and 8:00.

1084
01:08:40,730 --> 01:08:42,691
CARMEN: Aah !

1085
01:08:42,732 --> 01:08:44,276
Uhh !

1086
01:08:49,281 --> 01:08:51,950
[Clanking and whirring]

1087
01:09:07,382 --> 01:09:10,719
I trust this time Floop
will have a success to show us.

1088
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:14,347
The Fabulous Floop is away
on other business, sir.

1089
01:09:14,389 --> 01:09:16,183
Your army is complete.

1090
01:09:16,224 --> 01:09:19,227
The ultimate destructive force
is now within your grasp.

1091
01:09:19,269 --> 01:09:22,355
I'll believe that when I see it.

1092
01:09:26,401 --> 01:09:29,112
Welcome back, Ms. Gradenko.

1093
01:09:30,906 --> 01:09:33,700
It's good to be back, Alex.

1094
01:09:33,742 --> 01:09:35,660
Let's never have children.

1095
01:09:35,702 --> 01:09:39,498
- So Minion is the evil one.
- Yes.

1096
01:09:39,539 --> 01:09:41,500
FLOOP: But I will be blamed.

1097
01:09:41,541 --> 01:09:43,543
You have every reason
to be disappointed in me.

1098
01:09:43,585 --> 01:09:46,546
So what would you do if you
could shut this thing off...

1099
01:09:46,588 --> 01:09:48,048
and get out of here?

1100
01:09:48,089 --> 01:09:50,842
It's impossible. It can only be
turned off from the outside.

1101
01:09:52,344 --> 01:09:53,512
Just suppose.

1102
01:09:53,553 --> 01:09:56,056
I'd stop Minion.

1103
01:09:56,139 --> 01:09:58,433
FLOOP: I'd stop
the robot army and hope...

1104
01:09:58,475 --> 01:10:00,143
that the world would forgive me.

1105
01:10:00,227 --> 01:10:01,520
[Gagging]

1106
01:10:02,938 --> 01:10:04,397
You're my hero, Floop...

1107
01:10:04,439 --> 01:10:08,151
so I'm gonna help you,
then you're gonna help me.

1108
01:10:08,193 --> 01:10:11,279
- Minion must be stopped.
- Just one thing.

1109
01:10:12,614 --> 01:10:15,325
My show--what does it need?

1110
01:10:15,367 --> 01:10:17,786
I know it needs
something desperately...

1111
01:10:17,828 --> 01:10:19,996
but I can't figure it out.

1112
01:10:20,038 --> 01:10:21,790
Maybe you can?

1113
01:10:21,832 --> 01:10:24,376
It needs children.

1114
01:10:26,169 --> 01:10:27,587
Hold still.

1115
01:10:37,347 --> 01:10:40,684
Now let's stop Minion.

1116
01:10:40,725 --> 01:10:44,312
Must be stopped.
Must be stopped !

1117
01:10:47,816 --> 01:10:50,235
This one's for my sister!

1118
01:10:52,112 --> 01:10:54,739
Oh, Juni.

1119
01:10:54,781 --> 01:10:56,366
Hola.

1120
01:11:00,745 --> 01:11:02,372
Carmen? Juni?

1121
01:11:02,455 --> 01:11:05,542
- Mom !
- Mom ! Aah !

1122
01:11:05,625 --> 01:11:07,169
That's my Fooglie!

1123
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:10,922
The one I drew.

1124
01:11:13,717 --> 01:11:16,636
It's dad.

1125
01:11:16,678 --> 01:11:18,180
You're here!

1126
01:11:18,221 --> 01:11:22,392
- What's he doing here?
- He's OK. He's OK.

1127
01:11:23,518 --> 01:11:24,686
INGRID: How did you get here?

1128
01:11:27,647 --> 01:11:31,943
Mom, I've been skipping school,
going places...

1129
01:11:31,985 --> 01:11:33,403
taking ferry rides...

1130
01:11:33,445 --> 01:11:35,572
in the city...

1131
01:11:40,744 --> 01:11:43,205
INGRID:
It's OK. It's OK. I know.

1132
01:11:43,288 --> 01:11:44,748
We'll talk about it
when we get home.

1133
01:11:44,789 --> 01:11:47,167
- Running off to Belize.
- What? You went where?

1134
01:11:47,209 --> 01:11:49,544
You're right. Let's just talk
about this when we get home.

1135
01:11:49,586 --> 01:11:51,046
No, no, no, no.

1136
01:11:51,087 --> 01:11:53,715
You can tell me
everything now, OK?

1137
01:11:53,757 --> 01:11:56,051
Is that where you want to be,
free from your family?

1138
01:11:56,092 --> 01:11:57,636
Hey!

1139
01:11:59,012 --> 01:12:02,349
I used to. Not anymore.

1140
01:12:04,601 --> 01:12:08,313
You turned my dad
into a Fooglie?

1141
01:12:08,355 --> 01:12:09,481
No, I didn't.

1142
01:12:10,607 --> 01:12:13,485
But I might be able
to change him back.

1143
01:12:23,119 --> 01:12:26,081
[Squeaking]

1144
01:12:30,585 --> 01:12:32,712
MINION: Gentlemen...

1145
01:12:32,754 --> 01:12:35,799
your army marches to meet us
as we speak.

1146
01:12:35,841 --> 01:12:37,592
MINION: Your faith
and your patience...

1147
01:12:37,634 --> 01:12:39,302
have meant more than you know.

1148
01:12:39,344 --> 01:12:42,347
I speak for Mr. Floop
when I say that the value...

1149
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:45,058
we place on partnership is--

1150
01:12:45,142 --> 01:12:47,060
FLOOP: Minion! This is Floop.

1151
01:12:47,144 --> 01:12:49,020
Please report
to the robotics lab at once.

1152
01:12:49,062 --> 01:12:51,481
We have huge, major, big-time
problems with the robots.

1153
01:12:51,523 --> 01:12:54,192
LISP: I thought you said
Floop wasn't here.

1154
01:12:54,234 --> 01:12:55,735
He's not.

1155
01:12:55,777 --> 01:12:59,406
FLOOP: A problem, Mr. Minion,
as in mucho grande problemo.

1156
01:12:59,447 --> 01:13:00,949
I'm gonna...

1157
01:13:00,991 --> 01:13:02,826
just be a moment.

1158

FLOOP: Minion!

01:13:09,082 --> 01:13:10,876
Floop?

1160
01:13:10,917 --> 01:13:13,044
Where are you?

1161
01:13:13,086 --> 01:13:15,046
FLOOP: Behind you.

1162
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:18,842
What do you think you're doing?

1163
01:13:18,842 --> 01:13:20,385
You're supposed to be in line
with the others.

1164

[Using Minion's voice] You're
supposed to be with the others.

- Stop that.
- Stop that!

- Stop that this instant!
- Stop that this instant!

1167

Stop that right now!

1168
01:13:29,895 --> 01:13:31,605
Or what?

01:13:32,939 --> 01:13:34,441
No.

Clever boy you've got there,
Cortez. Very clever indeed.

1171

Yes.
He gets that from his mother.

in exchange for your daughter?

01:13:55,462 --> 01:13:58,757
I am going to show you
what happens...

1177
01:13:58,798 --> 01:14:00,717
when you cross the line
and involve family.

1178
01:14:00,759 --> 01:14:04,221

nice and comfortable.

We have to keep the army
from leaving the castle.

1188
01:14:43,134 --> 01:14:45,345
Our only chance is to get
to the control room...

1189
01:14:45,387 --> 01:14:47,597
and hope that their missions
have not been programmed.

1190
01:14:47,639 --> 01:14:48,849
And what if they have?

1191
01:14:48,890 --> 01:14:51,560
Then there's no one on earth
who can stop them.

1192
01:14:52,602 --> 01:14:55,564
- One at a time.
- Go. Go.

1193
01:15:01,528 --> 01:15:03,947
Left, left, left, left!

1194
01:15:03,947 --> 01:15:06,825
That way.
Where's Mom and Dad?

from here?

- Can't you remove it?
- We can't take 500 brains out!

1201
01:15:20,338 --> 01:15:24,134
- So don't. Just reprogram it.
- That would take weeks!

1202
01:15:24,176 --> 01:15:26,595
- Just two words.
- A binary switch. Of course.

1203
01:15:26,636 --> 01:15:29,097
So they would define
right as wrong...

1204
01:15:29,139 --> 01:15:32,100
And wrong as right. Come on.

1205
01:15:32,142 --> 01:15:33,685

Oh, don't worry.
I think it's reversible.

1216
01:16:15,477 --> 01:16:17,521
Careful.

They're stronger
and smarter now.

known you were behind this.

to your children.

their allowance.

now would be a good time...

1234
01:17:34,306 --> 01:17:39,394
to see a demonstration of your
wonderfully demonic children.

1235
01:17:39,436 --> 01:17:40,562
Certainly.

1236
01:17:49,696 --> 01:17:50,655
Argh !

1237
01:17:57,454 --> 01:17:59,748
Your parents
were so easy to capture...

1238
01:17:59,789 --> 01:18:01,416

1239
01:18:01,458 --> 01:18:04,211
Poor little Juni.

1240
01:18:04,252 --> 01:18:07,172
Defenseless and weak.

1241
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:16,348
You're a worthless
little squirt.

1242
01:18:17,557 --> 01:18:21,603
Juni! Don't listen to her.
You're not worthless!

1243
01:18:21,686 --> 01:18:24,648
You figured out
how to get us here.

1244
01:18:24,731 --> 01:18:28,151
You helped Floop realize
he was good, not bad.

1245
01:18:28,193 --> 01:18:30,695
You talked to the Fooglies
and saved Mom and Dad.

1246

You're strong, Juni!
You're strong!

1247
01:18:37,661 --> 01:18:40,205
You're not that strong, Juni!

1248
01:18:40,247 --> 01:18:41,915
Ow.

1249
01:18:41,957 --> 01:18:44,876

Carmen, Juni, close your eyes.

I'm thinking. I'm thinking.

Wonderful. Wonderful.

Yes. I've thought it out.

in one ear and out the other!

Why did you come back?

1290
01:21:26,204 --> 01:21:28,498
For the same reason I left.

I don't remember that reason.

It's OK. Let it go. Let it go.

OK. That's it.

That's it. That's it.

1301
01:21:54,524 --> 01:21:56,985
So, what did you teach them?

1302
01:21:57,027 --> 01:21:59,905
It's not what
I can teach the children...

1303
01:21:59,946 --> 01:22:02,782
but what you taught me.

1304
01:22:02,824 --> 01:22:05,035
You won today, Juni,
and not because...

1305
01:22:05,076 --> 01:22:07,037
you were the biggest
or the strongest...

1306
01:22:07,078 --> 01:22:11,249
but because you were
pure of heart and of mind.

1307
01:22:12,792 --> 01:22:15,212
And now the robots
have learned that as well.

1308
01:22:15,295 --> 01:22:17,547
Thank you.

1309
01:22:17,589 --> 01:22:21,343
We went on the old-fashioned
adventure I always wanted.

1310
01:22:21,384 --> 01:22:23,845
And we didn't do
one thing right.

1311
01:22:23,887 --> 01:22:25,847
Nope.

1312
01:22:25,889 --> 01:22:29,392
We did two things right.

1313
01:22:29,434 --> 01:22:31,895
There is something
that we have to tell you.

of children...

1321

who've done
some incredible good deeds.

1322

It seems that a day
doesn't go by...

1323
01:23:06,596 --> 01:23:08,265
that another amazing child...

act of charity...

Who are these children...

1327
01:23:13,937 --> 01:23:16,565
and why are they so good
at being good?

1328
01:23:20,861 --> 01:23:22,821
I gotta have
the business section.

1329
01:23:22,863 --> 01:23:24,781
I thought
you closed down your shop.

1330
01:23:24,823 --> 01:23:26,908
Yeah, but I gotta keep tabs
on free enterprise.

has come up in the Far East.

I need you on it right away.

Oh, sorry, Devlin.

1343

We haven't talked about this
as a family yet, so...

1344

GREGORIO: Whether we
come out of retirement...

1345
01:24:04,779 --> 01:24:08,033
or not is a decision
that is up to us...

1346
01:24:08,074 --> 01:24:10,577

1347
01:24:10,619 --> 01:24:13,538
Uh, Gregorio, Ingrid,

No, this assignment
is for Carmen and Juni.

1350

They're the ones we need.

1351
01:24:19,252 --> 01:24:21,213
They're the two most amazing
field agents...

1352
01:24:21,254 --> 01:24:23,089
that this organization's
ever seen.

1353
01:24:23,173 --> 01:24:24,966
So what do you say, kids?

1354
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:26,885
You up for it?

1355
01:24:26,927 --> 01:24:28,386
Devlin,
if you want the Cortezes...

1356
01:24:28,470 --> 01:24:30,722
you take all the Cortezes...

1357
01:24:30,764 --> 01:24:33,850
even Mom and Dad.

1358
01:24:33,892 --> 01:24:37,729
From now on, whatever we do,
we do together.

worth fighting for.

I know that you're with me
