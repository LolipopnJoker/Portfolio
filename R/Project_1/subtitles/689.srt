1
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,248
Morning, Laura.

2
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,080
I like a man who dresses for clamming.

3
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,082
Business.

4
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,090
And on our vacation.

5
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,248
Do you forgive me?

6
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,641
How about these? Aren't they beautiful?
I thought I could steam them for starters.

7
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,929
I told the Blanchard
we'd do their stupid party.

8
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,290
All your hard work.
I'll call them and cancel.

9
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,170
No.

10
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,760
I can just dig fresh ones tomorrow.

11
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,651
I missed you this morning.

12
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,010
Ives.

13
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,448
Look what I've done.

14
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,481
No problem.

15
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,291
I've time to change.

16
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,731
That's a pretty dress.

17
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,086
I wouldn't have thought of it.

18
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,003
You were thinking the red?

19
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,241
Uh...

20
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,766
- The black, actually.
- Well, it's backless.

21
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,044
It could be chilly tonight.

22
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,201
- Hi, Martin. Great to see you.
- Thanks.

23
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,528
Good to see ya.

24
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,408
Hi.

25
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,607
When I'm lying in
the midnight hour

26
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,287
Holding you just like a dream

27
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,490
Love is never what it seems

28
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,331
When we touch

29
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,526
Excuse me.

30
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,568
And you're holding me the way you do

31
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,720
Girl, you make
my dreams come true

32
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,610
Have I been social long enough?

33
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,650
For the whole season.

34
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,845
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah.

35
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,240
Come with me.

36
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,684
Isn't it a little early for this?

37
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,764
Everything in here as it should be?

38
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,091
I don't know why I forgot.

39
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,281
Well, we all forget things.
That's what reminding is for.

40
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,642
Thank you.

41
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,642
What's for supper?

42
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,805
Um, lamb with rosemary
and the peach chutney,

43
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,007
- new potatoes and baby peas.
- Sounds great.

44
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,845
I was gonna make that herb bread
that you like.

45
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,322
I can hardly wait.

46
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,971
- You renting from the Driscolls?
- Hi.

47
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,762
Yeah.

48
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,690
John Fleishman.
I guess we must be neighbors.

49
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,286
Martin Burney. We live up there.

50
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:13,281
Oh... So that must be your wife that I keep
seeing staring down from the window.

51
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,648
- Laura.
- Mm... You're a lucky man.

52
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,327
I've been admiring your house.
It's one of the best on Cape Cod.

53
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,801
Thanks. You're from Boston?

54
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,124
Yeah, I've escaped from Mass General.
I'm a neurologist there.

55
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,966
We live there too.
I'm an investment counselor.

56
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,249
This is a terrific boat.
Boats are a passion of mine.

57
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,243
One I don't get to indulge very often.

58
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,041
That's too bad. I would never
let anything keep me off the water.

59
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,606
My wife doesn't like sailing.
She can't swim.

60
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,001
Nearly drowned when she was a child.

61
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,648
I usually try to get her on a boat
once a season. It's difficult, but I try.

62
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,767
Well, listen, I'm gonna be takin'
a run up the coast this evening.

63
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,684
It's full moon,
weather's supposed to be great.

64
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,684
- Maybe this'd be a good time.
- Maybe.

65
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,843
Let me talk to her. I'll raise it gently.

66
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,082
- OK.
- Thanks.

67
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,371
Nice-looking man, the doctor.

68
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,203
- Doctor?
- He says I have a beautiful house.

69
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,885
Best on the beach.

70
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,167
When was he in here?

71
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,369
Yesterday while I was in town?

72
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,483
- Martin, I don't know the doctor.
- Sure you do.

73
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,645
Young, good-looking.
Outfitting his sailboat down there.

74
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,127
He says you've been staring at him
from the window all day.

75
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,924
Does it give you that much pleasure
to humiliate me?

76
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,091
Stop it!

77
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,564
- Now you'll sulk, won't you?
- No.

78
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,165
- Yes, you will.
- I won't.

79
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,925
You'll pout and spoil our supper.

80
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,682
Our beautiful supper.

81
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,120
Just smell the bread.

82
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,686
I'm so sorry. Will you smile?

83
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,882
Hm? Hm?

84
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,083
Your doctor friend,
he asked us to go sailing tonight.

85
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,768
Just a run along the coast.
Less than an hour each way.

86
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,970
I'll be right there, princess.
Right by your side.

87
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,886
I know how you feel, but we can't
conquer our fears by running away.

88
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,804
Do it? For me?

89
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,642
Hm?

90
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,162
I think I'll run into town.
Anything you need?

91
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,321
I'll be back.

92
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,728
Bonjour, madame.

93
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,770
You all alone in here?

94
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,446
They're beautiful.

95
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,845
I'm sorry we quarreled.

96
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,043
- If you don't like it I can...
- No, I do. I do.

97
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,690
Is it too early in the day for this?

98
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,563
You want something.
I know my princess.

99
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,888
I'm waiting.

100
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,725
Mrs. Clark called from the library.

101
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,647
- She said they could use me full time now.
- You already work three mornings a week,

102
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,805
and I support that
because I know your love of books.

103
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,807
What about our home?
Don't you love our home as much?

104
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,129
Has your dinner
been late to the table even once?

105
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,329
Oh, I can remember
not so far back it was late.

106
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,567
By two days.

107
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,007
That was six months ago.

108
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,245
My mother was all I had. I'll never forgive
myself for not bringing her to live with us.

109
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,408
You shouldn't beat yourself.

110
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,162
You always treated her with love.

111
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,564
She died, Martin.
How could I not go to her funeral?

112
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:16,370
If you had told me, I would have taken you,
given me a chance to pay my last respects.

113
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,841
But you sneaked off inexplicably.

114
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,364
I didn't sneak off.

115
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,049
- Need I remind you how I worried?
- No.

116
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,842
You reminded me enough
the night I came back.

117
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,161
- You aren't suggesting I enjoyed that?
- Oh, God, no.

118
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,362
That would make you a monster.

119
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,087
If I didn't know you better,
I'd think you were provoking a quarrel

120
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,242
so you'd be unable to sail tonight.

121
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:53,210
Now, this is a useful discussion, but one
best postponed until after our sail.

122
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,570
Don't you think?

123
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,248
Yes.

124
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,160
Thinking of our honeymoon?

125
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,370
The night I gave you that?
The night I taught you to dance?

126
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,808
Those were the happiest days
of my whole life.

127
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,241
We will always be together.

128
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,800
Nothing can keep us apart.

129
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,691
It's time to go.

130
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,645
I wish that moon would come back.

131
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,202
We're OK.

132
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,850
Ah, shit.
Well, so much for weather reports.

133
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,247
You said the weather would be fine.

134
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,369
Yeah. I don't know where
this is comin' from.

135
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,451
We're gonna turn back.
Prepare to come about.

136
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,487
Relax, princess. Nothing to worry about.

137
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,601
There's that first buoy.
We're almost home now.

138
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,880
Tighten the jib! Crank it in!

139
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,404
Martin, go try and bring down the jib!

140
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,048
Hang on!

141
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,048
Hold on! Hold on!

142
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,727
I've got it! Oh!

143
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,609
Keep pulling! Keep pulling!

144
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,760
I've got it.

145
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,922
Stay low, Martin.

146
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,366
- Grab it!
- Get the rope! Get the rope!

147
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,522
Got it!

148
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,089
Here! Gimme your hand!
Gimme your hand!

149
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,080
There! Hold on. I got you.

150
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,402
I got you.

151
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,882
- Laura!
- Oh, God!

152
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,451
- Oh, my God!
- Laura!

153
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,091
She can't swim!

154
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,009
Be careful!

155
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,691
- Laura! Laura!
- Laura?

156
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,322
- Laura! Laura!
- Careful, Martin!

157
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,442
Laura!

158
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,521
Laura!

159
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,008
Laura!

160
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,688
Laura!

161
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,682
Laura!

162
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,008
Laura!

163
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:49,048
Laura!

164
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,686
We've gotta have another boat,
and a helicopter.

165
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,361
- Get back on the radio, please!
- Object sighted on the port bow!

166
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,968
- There's something out there! See it?
- There's something out there!

167
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,362
- Let's go!
- Can you see what it is?

168
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,925
Laura!

169
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,091
We shall all come together once more
in God's gracious love and warm embrace,

170
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:44,961
for it is promised that whoever liveth
and believeth in me shall never die.

171
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,128
Amen.

172
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,168
Laura!

173
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,328
Laura!

174
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,208
Laura!

175
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,646
That was the night that I died,
and someone else was saved.

176
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,202
Someone who was afraid of water;
But learned to swim...

177
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,208
Come on, Laura!

178
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,804
Someone who knew
there would be one moment

179
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,370
when he wouldn't be watching.

180
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,361
Someone who knew that the darkness
from the broken lights

181
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,564
would show the way.

182
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,088
Good mornin'.

183
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,522
Don't you like green?

184
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,887
I don't have a red one left.

185
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,322
Come on. I got plenty.

186
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,441
You visitin' out here?

187
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,730
My mom's by herself in a nursing home.

188
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,407
She's blind
and can't move her left side very well.

189
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,801
She had a stroke.

190
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,406
I'm sorry to hear that.

191
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,330
You live back East?

192
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,247
I was visiting an old friend.

193
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,926
She needed me.

194
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:43,562
Sick, was she?
Course, it's none of my business.

195
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,051
She left her husband.

196
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,849
He was a horrible man. He used to beat her.

197
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,447
- No!
- It started right after their honeymoon.

198
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:02,368
At first he was charming, tender.
But it all changed.

199
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,569
He said if she left him he would
punish her, and he meant it.

200
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,291
His punishments were terrible.

201
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,167
He would never let her go.
Said he could find her anywhere.

202
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,886
Couldn't she call the police?

203
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,804
Well, she did.
She called them, and a lawyer too.

204
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:25,922
They said she could make a citizen's arrest,
get a restraining order. It was pathetic.

205
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,490
Well, how did she leave?

206
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,167
She risked everything.

207
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,447
Escaped.

208
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,000
Started a new life.

209
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,891
Brave girl.

210
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,806
She thinks she's a coward.

211
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,008
A coward?

212
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,120
Not a girl like that.

213
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,531
How long did you stay with him?

214
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,442
Too long.

215
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,566
Three years, seven months,

216
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,928
six days.

217
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,841
Thank you for the apple.

218
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,326
Hi. I'm Iris Nepper.
So glad you could come today.

219
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:43,049
The house has some great possibilities.
I think you'd like it.

220
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,922
- How much is it again?
- 700.

221
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,204
Plus first and last month's deposit,
Miss Walters.

222
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,362
Waters. Um...

223
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,966
700...

224
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,520
- I'm gonna take it.
- Good.

225
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,845
Ba-ba-ba baaaaa-dum!

226
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,050
When you're a Jet, you're a Jet all the way

227
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,761
From your first cigarette
to your last dyin' day

228
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,081
When you're a Jet,
you're a thing boo-doo-deh

229
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,003
Boo-doo-deh-boo-doo-deh
ba-doo-deh-ba-doo-deh

230
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:48,324
The Jets are in gear;
Our cylinders are clickin'

231
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,404
Bah-bah-bah-bah!
A- da-ba-doo-deh

232
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,244
A lousy chicken

233
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,085
Here come the Jets, yeah!
And we're gonna be, yeah!

234
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,646
We da-ba-doo-deh
ba-doo-deh ba-doo-deh

235
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:05,046
When you're a Jet, you stay a Jet!

236
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,090
Agh! Shit!

237
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,246
Harvest time?

238
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:14,291
You know, people get arrested
for stealing in this town.

239
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:20,282
They were on the ground.
They're all damaged and bruised.

240
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,002
Bruised?

241
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,683
Hm.

242
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,326
OK, well, not that one.

243
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,363
They all look pretty good to me.

244
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,523
This is unlawful trespass, you know.

245
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,126
It's just a few apples to bake a pie.

246
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,840
A pie.

247
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,241
Well, why didn't you say so?

248
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:55,928
Maybe we can make a deal. I love pie.

249
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,166
I don't make deals.

250
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,047
You forgot these.

251
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:23,162
It's a shame to let 'em rot on the ground.
They're really great for baking.

252
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,009
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare ya.

253
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,726
I'm sorry. Come on in.

254
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,045
Oh!

255
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,285
Shit!

256
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,765
So, hi, my name's Ben... Woodward.

257
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,246
That was me the other day.

258
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,171
On the lawn.

259
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,810
I know.

260
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:10,086
You caught me by surprise up there.

261
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,242
So I gathered.

262
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,607
I didn't realize anybody had moved in.

263
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,570
If I'd known, I would've
rehearsed a little.

264
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,122
You were pretty good.

265
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,124
Oh, yeah? You liked it?

266
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,882
It brought back a memory.
My mom took me to that show

267
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,769
when I was a little girl.

268
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,766
I love that show.

269
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:34,481
I directed it last semester.
I teach drama at the college here.

270
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,046
So tell me somethin', huh?

271
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,928
What's your name? Where are you from?

272
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,609
- Lotta questions.
- It's only two.

273
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,407
I don't mean to seem rude,
but it's late for me.

274
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,562
Maybe we could do this some other time.

275
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,804
I'm sorry,
but... I'm not free till tomorrow night.

276
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,846
I'm makin' pot roast for dinner.
It'd be great with apple pie.

277
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,401
I'm sure it would.

278
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,600
Look, don't say anything.
I'll set two places, eight o'clock.

279
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,762
If you don't show,

280
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:15,162
I'll be eatin' pot roast for a week.

281
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,046
It's no big deal, right?

282
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,685
Right.

283
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,362
- Good night.
- Good night.

284
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,770
Mn Burney? You have a call.

285
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,249
- I told you to hold my calls.
- I know. But she says she knew your wife.

286
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,641
Put her through.

287
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,528
- Hello?
- Hello, Mn Burney.

288
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,046
My name is Vanessa Shelley.

289
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:03,283
- Yes?
- I hope I'm not disturbing you.

290
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,601
I just heard about Laura,
and I wanted to call

291
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,490
and tell you how much we'll miss hen

292
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,642
Thank you.

293
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,883
- How did you know her?
- From the YWCA.

294
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:19,084
No, you must be speaking of someone else.
My wife never went to the YWCA.

295
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:23,768
No. No, we took swimming there
Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 8am.

296
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:27,168
Look, there's obviously some mistake.

297
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,483
My wife drowned. She couldn't swim.

298
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,770
Well, at first she couldn't.
But she became a good swimmer:

299
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:39,447
- I'm sure you have the wrong woman.
- This is odd.

300
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:43,764
Mn Burney
your wife studied gymnastics, didn't she?

301
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:47,646
- No, my wife never studied gymnastics.
- That's strange.

302
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:51,884
She told us that's how
she got all those terrible bruises.

303
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,490
Mn Burney I don't understand it.
I'm sorry if I've bothered you.

304
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,927
This is just so confu...

305
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,567
Ohh! Shit.

306
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,282
shit!

307
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,365
Fire department.

308
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:27,290
I hope you like your roast well done.

309
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,166
Come on in.

310
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,760
- Is that apple?
- What else?

311
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,161
Can I get you something?
Eye drops? Gas mask?

312
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:45,170
- No, thanks.
- How about some more music?

313
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,966
- I liked what you had on.
- No, I mean classical. For during dinner.

314
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:53,445
Sure, I like classical.
Anything but Berlioz.

315
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,090
Oh?

316
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,642
Yeah. His Symphonie Fantastique
gives me the chills.

317
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,644
Oh, really? Thanks for the tip.

318
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:09,328
So I understand you're lookin' for a job.

319
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,290
- Where'd you hear that?
- Well...

320
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,806
Small towns are funny places.

321
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,087
Everybody knows everybody.

322
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,561
And I know a lot of people
over at the college.

323
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,371
I could drop in a good word for you
if you like.

324
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,324
Why would you do that?

325
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,290
God! Such paranoia.

326
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,924
Where are you from? New York?

327
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:38,005
Listen, it's no problem.
With a few letters of recommendation...

328
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,323
I don't have letters of recommendation.

329
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,801
Transcripts?

330
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,007
Come on! You got a driver's license, right?

331
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,406
Look,
I really don't wanna talk about this, OK?

332
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:56,004
- Gotcha.
- I'm not asking for anything, Ben.

333
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,204
Neither am I.

334
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,326
Jesus! That's a real...

335
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,245
YOU OK?

336
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,201
Yeah, I'm gonna be.

337
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,762
Listen. There's only one more thing
I'm gonna ask,

338
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:21,650
only one thing I wanna know.

339
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,566
Do you have a name?

340
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,489
Sara Waters.

341
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,846
Well... That's a start.

342
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,641
She spoke so highly of you,
the quality of care.

343
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,166
Laura's mother was so happy here.

344
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:10,802
Well, it's always nice to hear that.
We enjoyed having her with us.

345
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,407
Laura's passing was so sudden,
so shocking.

346
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:20,729
I tried to talk to as many of her family
and friends as I could find.

347
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:28,121
Then I thought maybe there were people
close to her that I never knew.

348
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,730
Perhaps they visited her mother here.

349
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,322
You might remember or have records.

350
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,523
Well, I'm afraid
we don't keep records on visitors.

351
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,126
- And you flew here, just...?
- Well, no.

352
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:45,040
I thought Laura might want
to be laid to rest here

353
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,646
in whatever place her mother was buried.

354
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:51,886
So her mother's passed on as well?

355
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:56,761
Six months ago her mother died here,
in your care.

356
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,005
Six months ago your wife removed
her mother from this institution.

357
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:05,364
She was handicapped, as you know,
but otherwise in reasonably good health.

358
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:09,963
Mrs. Burney simply showed up,
paid the bill, and collected her mother.

359
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,720
Did she say where she was taking her?

360
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:18,968
Why, home, of course. To live with you.

361
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,530
- Hi.
- Hi.

362
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,490
- What are you doin' here?
- Waitin' for ya.

363
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,921
How's it goin'?
What have they got you doin'?

364
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,844
Stacking. Filing. Overdue books.

365
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,565
- Are you enjoying it?
- I like it.

366
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,967
Thanks for helping me work this out.

367
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:46,887
I saw you in town yesterday.
You were going into Walgreens.

368
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,281
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

369
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,045
I called out your name.
You didn't even blink.

370
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:56,409
- Maybe I didn't hear you.
- Your name isn't Sara Waters, is it?

371
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,966
- Maybe I didn't hear you.
- No, you heard me.

372
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,084
Look, I know this is crazy.

373
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,967
I hardly know you really, but...

374
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,601
I like you.

375
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:12,963
I do. I just...

376
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,602
I don't know how to feel what I'm feeling

377
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:20,564
when I don't even know your name.

378
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,450
People never really know each other, Ben.

379
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,403
It doesn't have to be that way.
Give it a chance.

380
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,047
- I can't. I'm sorry.
- What are you afraid of?

381
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,851
- What is it with men?
- Don't do that.

382
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,371
Look, I gotta know.

383
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:45,163
We're either honest with each other or it
doesn't happen. It just stops right here.

384
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,766
It never started.

385
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,368
OK.

386
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,607
Hillgrove Nursing Home.

387
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:18,207
- May I speak to Chloe Williams, please?
- Who's calling, please?

388
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:22,285
- A friend of the family.
- Just a minute. I'll put you through.

389
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,602
Hello?

390
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,727
Speak up, please. I can't hear you.

391
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:36,042
- Hello?
- I miss you, Mom.

392
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,408
Hello?

393
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,042
I can't hear Is anyone there?

394
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,245
- I love you. And I'm OK.
- Hello?

395
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:48,286
Oh, Jane, there's nobody on the line.

396
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:53,171
- Oh, I have so much to tell you.
- Did they say who was calling?

397
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,322
See you soon.

398
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:06,924
- And where was she last seen?
- In a nursing home here in Minneapolis.

399
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:10,722
- So you tried there?
- Six months ago she was removed.

400
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,888
Taken elsewhere.

401
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:17,329
But in her condition, not very far.
I'd suggest two days' drive at most.

402
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,961
I can put three men on it. But it'll cost.

403
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,002
Good.

404
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,731
I want this taken very seriously.

405
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:32,482
And if she's found, a $10,000 bonus
to the man who does, in cash.

406
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,760
And another ten to you.

407
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,322
Sorry.

408
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,566
- Hi!
- Hi.

409
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,447
YUCK!

410
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:42,803
This, uh, little girl
went nuts with the cotton candy.

411
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:46,641
- Yeah, I saw her. She was beautiful.
- And knows it, too.

412
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,609
It's good to see you.

413
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:53,770
- Yeah, you too.
- I feel kinda funny about the other day.

414
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:57,367
- Let's just forget about it, OK?
- OK.

415
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:04,122
- Heartland, huh?
- Have you always lived here?

416
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:08,649
No, I lived in New York for a couple years.
Tried to be an actor.

417
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:12,805
Closest I ever got to Broadway
was tendin' bar at Sardi's.

418
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:17,442
Sometimes I feel like a failure
for comin' back here,

419
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:20,643
but other times I think
it's the smartest move I ever made.

420
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,162
Know why I came here?

421
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,481
To be near my mom.

422
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:29,770
She had a partial stroke three years ago.
I couldn't care for her.

423
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:33,686
- How is she now?
- I don't know. I haven't seen her.

424
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,610
I haven't gone there yet.

425
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:40,002
- Why not?
- I'm not sure it's safe.

426
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:52,201
Hush, little baby don't say a word

427
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:57,166
Momma's gonna buy you a mockingbird

428
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,449
- Sara?
- Ben?

429
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,688
Yeah, it's me.

430
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:08,644
- I'm sorry. Did I scare ya?
- I'm just a little on edge.

431
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:12,805
- Look, I want you to come with me.
- Come with you where?

432
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,768
Ben, where are you?

433
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,000
Go ahead. Jump on.

434
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,968
Hey where did we go

435
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,168
Days when the rains came?

436
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,402
Down in the hollow

437
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,682
Playin' a new game

438
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,326
Laughin' and a-runnin', hey, hey

439
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:38,168
Skippin' and a-jumpin'

440
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,287
In the misty mornin' fog

441
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:44,682
With our, our hearts a-thumpin'

442
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,842
And you

443
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,328
My brown eyed girl

444
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,368
You, my brown eyed girl

445
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,082
Now whatever happened

446
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:04,008
To Tuesday and so slow?

447
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:10,211
Goin' down to the old mine
with a transistor radio

448
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,366
Standin' in the sunlight laughin'

449
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,122
Hidin' behind a rainbow's wall

450
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:20,202
Slippin' and a-slidin'

451
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,408
All along the waterfall

452
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,602
With you

453
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,248
My brown eyed girl

454
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,561
You, my brown eyed girl

455
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,048
Do you remember when

456
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:45,726
We used to sing
sha la la la la la la la la la-la te-da

457
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:52,081
Just like that,
sha la la la la la la la la la-la te-da

458
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,482
La te-da

459
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:07,881
Here's my story it's sad but true

460
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:12,683
It's about a girl that I once knew

461
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:19,163
She took my love, then ran around

462
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:24,451
With every single guy in town

463
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,010
I should have known it from the very start

464
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:55,124
This girl would leave me
with a broken heart

465
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:57,971
Listen, people, what I'm tellin' you

466
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:01,209
Keep away from Runaround Sue, yeah

467
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,971
I miss her lips and the smile on her face

468
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:07,243
The touch of her hand
and this girl's warm embrace

469
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:10,324
So if you don't want to cry like I do

470
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:13,046
Keep away from Runaround Sue

471
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:28,164
She likes to travel around, yeah

472
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:31,005
She'll love ya, then she'll put you down

473
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:33,441
Now, people, let me put you wise

474
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,891
Sue goes out with other guys

475
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:40,646
Here'S the moral and the story
from the guy who knows

476
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,291
I fell in love and my love still grows

477
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,840
Ask any fool that she ever knew

478
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:48,730
They'll say
"Keep away from Runaround Sue"

479
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:06,411
NO...

480
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,608
Ben, stop.

481
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:12,082
Ben, no. Stop, please.
I can't. I can't. It's not right.

482
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:15,130
Stop! Stop it! Stop it!

483
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,802
I'm sorry.

484
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:23,562
I'm sorry.

485
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:26,122
Sara...

486
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,767
God, what did he do to you?

487
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:33,689
Please go. Please.

488
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,125
Sara, please.

489
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:38,961
Please. Oh God, Ben, please.
I'm sorry, but you have to go.

490
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:57,446
What you said is right.

491
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:00,761
I had a husband.

492
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,400
And he hurt me.

493
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:10,410
- I guess I'm just really afraid.
- Of what?

494
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:16,645
Of never getting my life back together.

495
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:19,766
It just feels like that.

496
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,806
Someday you might surprise yourself.

497
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,720
I'm glad you're here.

498
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:31,928
Me too.

499
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,648
- Hold still.
- I am holding still.

500
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:54,042
- Your mouth. Keep it shut.
- Well, it's tickling me.

501
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,004
- OK. Hold that front there.
- Here?

502
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,923
Yeah.

503
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:09,122
Oh, Ben, that looks great.

504
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:13,844
- Even your mother won't recognize you.
- My mother will recognize me.

505
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,286
Can I help you, sir?

506
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:44,683
Yeah, I'm looking for the rest room,
ma'am.

507
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:47,491
It's right around the corner there.

508
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:01,489
Jane? Is that you, Jane?

509
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:08,161
Hush, little baby don't say a word

510
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:12,600
Momma's gonna buy you a mockingbird

511
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:16,842
Oh! Laura, you're here!

512
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,080
Hi, Mom. Hi.

513
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,922
You look wonderful.

514
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,923
- Wha't...?
- Oh.

515
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,126
It's a disguise.

516
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:35,727
- Are you all right?
- I left him, Mom.

517
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,410
It just became so terrible.

518
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:46,087
But I'm all right now,
and we're gonna be fine.

519
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:49,050
You look so beautiful.

520
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:52,920
- Oh, it's a wig.
- Is he looking for you?

521
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:57,326
I don't think so.

522
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:00,609
- But I'm not sure.
- God! What did he do?

523
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:03,246
It doesn't matter now.

524
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,728
You'll be OK alone?

525
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:12,647
Mm... Yeah, I'm OK.

526
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:14,802
I got a job.

527
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:19,448
Makin' my own money, and I have a friend.

528
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:22,811
A man.

529
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,962
He's nice, Mom.

530
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:28,089
He teaches drama
at the college in Cedar Falls.

531
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:32,851
It's been hard for you.

532
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:37,361
Honey, you're gonna be fine.

533
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:40,166
Inside, you always were.

534
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:46,684
There's nothing Martin or any man
can do or say to take that away.

535
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:50,286
You have yourself.

536
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,642
Thanks, Mom.

537
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:37,324
Excuse me. I wonder if you could help me.

538
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,243
I can try.

539
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:44,211
My younger sister
used to work for the lady in room 14.

540
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:46,123
She's returning to this area

541
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,964
and I know she'll want
to visit Mrs. Williams.

542
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:51,086
And you'd like to leave a message for her?

543
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,763
Well, the thing is,

544
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:58,448
my sister married someone the family
didn't approve of really and we grew apart.

545
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,648
I was wrong to let that happen.

546
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:04,042
If she knows I'm here,
she won't see me or take my calls.

547
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:06,248
I wanna surprise her.

548
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:10,166
What I need is someone
just to let me know she's here.

549
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:13,130
Someone I can trust to keep a secret.

550
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:16,886
Here's my name and motel number.

551
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,970
It would sure mean a lot to me.

552
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:22,646
I'd be glad to help.

553
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:24,848
Thanks.

554
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:36,566
Jane?

555
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:39,524
Jane... Jane?

556
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:45,010
- Mom, who were you talking to?
- Nobody, I guess.

557
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:48,163
Here's your medicine. Hold out your hand.

558
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:42,808
Oh! Excuse me, sir? Won't be a minute.

559
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:46,965
Uh, I gotta go. OK.
Yeah. I'll call you later. Bye-bye.

560
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,287
You asked about Chloe Williams' visitors.

561
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:53,523
Well, for six months not one,
then suddenly today...

562
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:57,047
- A young woman.
- Uh-uh. A young man, a little mustache.

563
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,361
Only just walked out that door.

564
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:30,010
- Did you see her?
- God, it was perfect!

565
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:34,290
Oh, she looks so beautiful.
Nobody suspected a thing. I felt so safe.

566
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:37,284
You are safe. You are.

567
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:59,284
Will you let me help you with your supper?
It does look delicious.

568
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:02,523
- Who are you?
- My name is Darryl Walker, ma'am.

569
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,881
I'm a police officer.

570
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,049
Oh... Am I under arrest?

571
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:11,968
No, no.
I just have some questions.

572
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:15,525
Shall we start with some steak?

573
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:21,482
You had a visitor yesterday.

574
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:27,203
Yes, my nephew. He's from Wisconsin.

575
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:30,284
Good girl. Laura should be proud of you.

576
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:33,202
Carrots.

577
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:38,887
We have to get word to her, ma'am.
The Boston police have called us.

578
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:43,409
They say her husband is in this area.
We think he wants to harm her.

579
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:47,644
So if she calls,
have her ring the police at Sioux City...

580
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:50,007
She won't call. Not till Sunday, she said.

581
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:54,481
That's a long time.

582
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:57,131
He's a crazy man.

583
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,681
I know that.

584
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:03,286
He's very dangerous.

585
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:09,722
Help us find him, Chloe, for God's sake.

586
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:13,088
- We have to warn her.
- I don't know where!

587
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:16,243
Think! Think.

588
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,687
Is she with someone?

589
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:22,207
A man, perhaps?
Someone we could contact.

590
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:25,607
He teaches dramatics.

591
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:31,603
- Where?
- At a college in Cedar Falls.

592
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,362
Thank you, Chloe.

593
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:44,009
Help her.

594
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:49,208
Please.

595
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:52,641
Chloe? It's time for your medicine.

596
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:55,491
Here you go, Chloe.

597
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:58,811
Don't worry.

598
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:29,851
Where is she?
Please don't make me ask again.

599
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:34,090
- I don't... I don't know...
- My wife. She's only my wife.

600
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:37,607
- A wonderful fuck, isn't she?
- Mister, you've got the wrong guy.

601
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,445
That would be disappointing.
I hate to be wrong.

602
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:44,844
- Why? Why does it have to be me?
- Because you teach drama.

603
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:47,770
Oh, Jesus!
God, there must be half a dozen...

604
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:51,242
- It's you.
- No! You don't understand.

605
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:53,607
I live with another man.

606
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:55,882
Ask anyone!

607
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,611
If you tell anyone, if you tell the police,

608
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:04,564
you and your gentleman friend...

609
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:25,003
Stay with me, Nina,
I implore you, or let me go with you...

610
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:27,731
OK. Good, good.
Come on down for a second.

611
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:31,725
One thing we can't forget is
Treplev hasn't seen Nina in two years,

612
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:35,640
so when he gets her in the room,
he wants her to stay. Know what I mean?

613
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:40,965
Nina, I cursed you. I hated you.
I tore up all your letters and photographs,

614
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:46,211
but every minute I was conscious
that my soul was bound to yours forever.

615
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:48,362
I can never stop loving you.

616
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:52,843
Ever since I lost you,
my life has been unbearable. I'm miserable.

617
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:55,685
I call to you,
I kiss the ground you walked on.

618
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:58,525
Wherever I look, I see your face.

619
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:02,047
I am alone.
I've no one's affection to warm me.

620
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:04,600
I am as cold as if I were
living in a dungeon,

621
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:08,765
and no matter what I write,
it's dry, hard, dark.

622
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:12,771
Stay here, Nina, I implore you,

623
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:15,366
or let me go with you.

624
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:21,287
- You ever loved someone that much?
- No.

625
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:24,609
So, give me 20 minutes.
I just wanna freshen up.

626
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:32,641
- Oh... Can I bring anything?
- Just you. And leave your friends at home.

627
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:35,200
I won't take long.

628
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:04,688
Oh!

629
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:08,807
I'm sorry. Are you OK?

630
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:12,047
Saying goodbye to old ghosts, you know.

631
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:15,569
- What are you doin' here?
- It's all set.

632
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:18,291
- Come on. Get dressed.
- OK.

633
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:20,886
I'll see you out there.

634
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,921
Do you wanna do somethin' tomorrow?

635
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,082
Yeah, sure.

636
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:57,251
I had a really good time tonight.

637
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:59,488
Me too.

638
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:08,802
- Tomorrow.
- Yeah.

639
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,448
Ben.

640
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:01,802
Shit!

641
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:46,529
No!

642
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:57,888
Hello, princess.

643
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:02,286
It's wonderful to see ya...

644
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:05,162
alive.

645
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:09,887
Ohh.
That's the first touch after so long apart.

646
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:14,891
Have you been thinking of it too?

647
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:20,286
Sara? Are you there?

648
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:28,125
- NO...
- I'll kill him.

649
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:31,124
- Can you hear me?
- Just a second.

650
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:50,409
- Hi.
- Hi.

651
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:53,922
It's tomorrow. 12:05. I couldn't wait.

652
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:59,245
- Ben, I'm just so tired.
- Still spooked by ghosts, huh?

653
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,129
- They're all around me.
- How about I come in?

654
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:06,647
Um... It's really not a good time, OK?

655
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:11,286
Oh. Later, then.

656
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:18,447
- Good night, Sara.
- Good night.

657
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:24,046
He doesn't matter.
He's nothing, Laura. Nothing.

658
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,162
Fuck you.

659
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:42,287
What's his name?

660
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:43,566
Hm?

661
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:47,083
Ben.

662
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:49,368
Martin, he...

663
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:52,967
He doesn't have anything to do with us,
does he, princess?

664
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:56,206
- Does he?
- No.

665
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:03,761
Remember our honeymoon.
The night I taught you to dance.

666
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:13,723
Of course you haven't forgotten.

667
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:18,004
You said those were
the happiest days of your whole life.

668
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:21,445
Remember this? Hm?

669
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:25,046
This is yours, Laura.

670
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:27,930
We are one. We will always be one.

671
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,526
Nothing can keep us apart.

672
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:35,241
Martin...

673
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,251
Argh!

674
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:52,042
I'm impressed.

675
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:58,041
Now let's end this while
you're still ahead.

676
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:01,649
Come to me, Martin. Walk this way.

677
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:04,246
Always my pleasure.

678
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:11,001
- That's far enough.
- Oh, I don't think so.

679
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:13,686
Here feels right.

680
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:17,761
There's the telephone.

681
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:21,447
You could call the police.

682
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:26,560
I know your every thought, Laura.
You're wondering if they can protect you.

683
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:29,569
Who knows?

684
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:34,646
They may issue an order instructing me
to stay away from my own wife.

685
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:38,250
Nothing can keep me away.

686
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:41,128
I love you, Laura.

687
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:45,286
I can't live without you.

688
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:48,487
And I won't let you live without me.

689
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:03,130
Think carefully.

690
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:12,481
- Yes, give me the police. Hurry, please.
- This is our last chance.

691
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:17,929
- Yes, this is Sara Waters at 408 Tremont.
- Take that chance.

692
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:21,050
