Con Air

00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,738
Army Rangers have a proud history.

3
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:34,076
Since the 1700s, Rangers have led
the way in every major confrontation...

4
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,120
in which the United States
has been involved.

5
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:41,542
You men are a credit to that fine
heritage, and I'm sorry to see you go.

6
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:45,629
But you've served your country well, and
you've displayed the ability to fight on...

7
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,965
to the Ranger objective
and complete its mission:

8
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:53,095
never leaving behind a fallen comrade
no matter what the odds or the enemy.

9
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,805
I thank you.

10
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,182
America thanks you.

11
00:00:57,224 --> 00:01:00,143
And I wish you luck wherever you go.

12
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:03,897
And remember, Rangers lead the way.

13
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:14,157
- Hi, Tricia.
- Hey.

14
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,829
- Hey, Tricia Poe.
- Hello, Dale.

15
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:23,292
How do I

16
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:27,838
Get through one night
without you

17
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,675
If I had to live without you

18
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,970
What kind of life would that be

19
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:38,515
Oh, I

20
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:41,351
I need you in my arms
Need you to hold

21
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,353
- Hummingbird.
- Hi.

22
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:45,689
- You're my world, my heart and soul
- Look at you.

23
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,692
I'd take a beatin' half my life
to get a piece of that woman.

24
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,986
- How's my baby?
- She's doin' fine.

25
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,531
- Baby, you would take away everything
- Yeah?

26
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,992
- Good in my life
- What? You're kidding me!

27
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:59,077
- What?
- Sweetie?

28
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:02,581
Hey, shh. Can't you see I'm in
the middle of somethin' here? What?

29
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:06,251
- How do I live without you
- You, you gonna be Miss Alabama?

30
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,754
Well, that makes your daddy
very proud.

31
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:14,426
Oh, I know
How do I breathe without you

32
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,428
If you ever go

33
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:19,723
Tricia Poe!
You little angel, you.

34
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,476
Hey, how about joinin' me
and the boys for a cold one?

35
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,395
- Huh, darlin'?
- No, thanks.

36
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,397
Who's your
Captain Huckleberry here?

37
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,776
- You know this gentleman, honey?
- He's a regular.

38
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:35,113
Yeah, I'm a regular.
Huh. Regular hound dog.

39
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:42,037
This is a special occasion, and if you don't
mind, I'd like to spend it dancin' with my wife.

40
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,625
Tell you what, soldier Dick. Why don't
you go buy me and my buddies a round?

41
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,711
Hey, Cameron, no.
lt ain't worth it.

42
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:54,132
Hey. Come on, Daddy.
Let's dance.

43
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:56,385
Oh, chickenshit!

44
00:02:56,468 --> 00:03:00,722
'Cause of pussies like you,
we lost Vietnam. I'll tell ya that.

45
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:03,642
- We don't need trouble.
- Oh, you should be so proud.

46
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,646
You know, for a second there
you were that guy again.

47
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,440
I know it.

48
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:17,030
Well, I was hopin' maybe the army
would make that guy grow up.

49
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,782
Well...

50
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:22,160
- He has.
- Then tell me now

51
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:26,415
How do I live without you

52
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:29,376
I want to know

53
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,714
How do I breathe without you

54
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:37,342
If you ever go

55
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:48,187
Hey, Gomer!

56
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,940
Thought you might need a little help
escortin' your old lady home.

57
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,530
Cameron, let's go home.
Just get in the car.

58
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:01,366
- Come on.
- Cameron!

59
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,827
Cameron, get in the car!

60
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,336
Dale! Dale!

61
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,309
Take this, you son of a bitch!

62
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:44,409
Tricia!

63
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:46,537
Tricia!

64
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,753
God, he's dead.
Cameron, this guy's dead.

65
00:04:57,673 --> 00:05:00,259
Admit the facts,
and enter a plea bargain.

66
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:02,302
I will not plead guilty.

67
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:04,596
You could get ten years.

68
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:11,603
Admit to it, you get four.

69
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:14,231
Serve maybe a year.

70
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:19,736
Cameron Poe, you have pleaded guilty
to manslaughter in the first degree.

71
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,739
With your military skills,
you are a deadly weapon...

72
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:26,034
and are not subject to the same laws
as other people that are provoked...

73
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:28,620
because you can respond
with deadly force.

74
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:32,833
lt is the order of this court that you
be remanded to a federal penitentiary...

75
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:38,172
where you shall remain incarcerated
for a term not less than 7 to 10 years.

"Con Air"
action-thriller, USA, 1997

77
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,141
Hello, pretty girl.

78
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,476
Come, come. Bring it here. Hey! Hey!

79
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:59,693
Dearest Tricia, I think of you always.
Your smile, your laugh.

80
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:03,655
I'm not angry. The blame's
gotta fall on me.

81
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:07,367
I am, however, torn apart
when I think that I won't...

82
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,037
be there to see our child
come into the world...

83
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:13,123
cradled in your arms,
and her first smile.

84
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,211
I got your package.
Those pink coconut things...

85
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:19,671
have made me quite popular.

86
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:24,635
Met a guy just the other day.
Baby-O. He sure does love 'em.

87
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:30,182
And now our daughter, beautiful Casey.

88
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:32,684
I watch her grow
in the pictures you send.

89
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,521
I showed 'em to Baby-O.
His reaction was simple.

90
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,190
He said, "Thank God
she looks like her mama."

91
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:40,692
I'd have to agree.

92
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:44,488
lt's funny, but here I am in maybe
the worst place on earth, and yet...

93
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,032
somehow I feel like
the luckiest man alive.

94
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:58,669
Dear Daddy, I started today at
the Little Sunshine Day Care Center.

95
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,672
My teacher is Miss Gordon. She is nice.

96
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:05,175
We go to playtime, and we all have
to hold hands when we walk there.

97
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:08,428
Dear Casey, it was so good
to read your letter.

98
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:10,514
I'm glad you like your teacher.

99
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:13,058
We don't exactly have
a playtime like you.

100
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:17,521
We do go outside, though. But
normally, we don't hold hands.

101
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:25,237
My wife and I will have
our Margaritas on the yacht.

102
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,414
Dear Daddy, today was
my first day at first grade.

103
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:39,543
I didn't like it. I don't want
to go back tomorrow.

104
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:44,131
This boy, Scotty Dalton, has
black teeth and calls me names.

105
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:48,093
Mama says I have to go back.
Tell her not to make me.

106
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:52,931
Dear Casey, hopefully this finds you
still goin' to the first grade.

107
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:57,269
School is very important.
Your mama's right.

108
00:07:57,311 --> 00:08:00,480
Now, don't you worry
about little Scotty Dalton.

109
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:04,401
Sometimes you meet people like that,
but don't let 'em get you down.

110
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:13,118
Dear Daddy, are you ever comin' home?

111
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:16,246
Dear Casey, of course I'm comin' home.

112
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,625
In just a little while longer, and all
the things we missed doin' together...

113
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,752
you can be sure we'll do.

114
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:26,298
Dear Hummingbird, break out
the fine china, chill the lemonade...

115
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,634
tie a yellow ribbon
'round the old oak tree...

116
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:32,638
'cause this boy's comin' home to
his ladies, comin' home forever.

117
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:37,267
I just hope I'm not a disappointment
to Casey or to you.

118
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:40,187
Love, Cameron.

119
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,524
"My daddy is coming home
on July 14th.

120
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:46,527
My birthday is July 14th.

121
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:51,031
I'm going see my daddy for the first
time ever on July 14th.""

122
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:54,826
I can't wait to meet you, honey. Isn't
that the cutest thing you ever heard?

123
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:56,995
Yeah, man.

124
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:01,166
Hey, now, what is this?

125
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:05,420
I can't see my little daughter on her birthday
without bringin' her a gift, now can I?

126
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:07,881
Yeah, man,
but that's a bunny rabbit.

127
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:10,259
That's all right. I mean,
she'll like it, right? I mean, what?

128
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:13,846
lt's either this or a tube of toothpaste and
two packs of Pall Malls at the canteen.

129
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:18,934
- Now, that's a present.
- I'll remember that on your birthday.

130
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,311
Yeah, you do that, man.

131
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:29,987
"lt having been made to appear to
the United States Parole Commission...

132
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,949
Cameron Poe is eligible
to be paroled.""

133
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:37,870
Shit, might be a long time before I see
somethin' like that with my name on it.

134
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:49,339
- You'll get your own date someday, Baby-O.
- I ain't worried about that, man.

135
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:53,010
Yeah, but like at this new prison you're
goin' to, who's gonna watch your back?

136
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:56,305
God's got my back.
You know what I'm sayin'?

137
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,642
I'm goin' home, son!

138
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:03,395
Wait, don't be gettin' all juicy
on me, all right? Get off me.

139
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,191
Step out.

140
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,572
Good-bye. Good night.

141
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:24,374
The U.S. Marshal Service
annually flies...

142
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,711
155,000 prisoners
around the country...

143
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,839
for transfers, legal hearings
and medical exams.

144
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:34,927
As you know, today's flight
is a special one.

145
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:38,388
We're populating Alabama's
Feltham Penitentiary...

146
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:41,517
the newest super-max facility
in the system.

147
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,853
This place was designed
to warehouse the worst of the worst.

148
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:48,774
Now, most of these guys
are lifers, some on death row.

149
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:52,861
Pure predators,
each and every one of them.

150
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:58,575
- Hey, lady!
- Lady's a dog in a Walt Disney movie.

151
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:01,119
My name is Bishop.
Guard Bishop to you.

152
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:04,748
Well, I gotta be gettin' my shot before we
go gettin' on some airplane, Guard Bishop.

153
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:09,086
- What's your name?
- Odell. They didn't give me my shot last night.

154
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:13,966
Okay, you're diabetic? All right, your insulin's on board.
We'll give it to you in flight.

155
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,135
- Cameron Poe.
- Yes, ma'am.

156
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:19,054
You know you're still under full
restraints till you're processed...

157
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:21,265
and released from your original
prison, understand?

158
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:24,601
Yes, ma'am. As long as I make it home
on time, it makes no never mind.

159
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:27,479
- lt's my daughter's birthday.
- Well, congratulations.

160
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:31,567
I got locked down three months before
she was born. She ain't never seen me.

161
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,027
- And why not?
- No way was she gonna meet her daddy...

162
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:37,823
in a prison visitor room
surrounded by homemade cookies and...

163
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:40,450
and love-starved murderers.

164
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:44,913
- No way.
- What you got here is a walking, talking reason to rehabilitate.

165
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:53,463
So today let's exemplify
our three operative words:

166
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:56,758
firm, fair and vigilant.

167
00:11:57,885 --> 00:11:59,636
Now, let's go to work.

168
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,181
We off-load six in Carson City,
the rest are sheeted to Feltham.

169
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:04,474
Good. Let's go deal
with the DEA boys.

170
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:10,314
- You know this guy?
- Haven't had the pleasure.

171
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,649
He's a piece of work,
a real piece of work.

172
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,112
Duncan, good to see you.
She sure is beautiful.

173
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:20,824
Hey, beautiful? Sunsets are beautiful.
Newborn babies are beautiful.

174
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:22,951
This, this is
fucking spectacular!

175
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:26,163
Duncan, this is Vince Larkin.
He's overseeing the transpo.

176
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:29,333
Vince, Duncan Malloy, DEA.

177
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:33,128
Nice to meet ya. I'm sure we're gonna have
a good time working on this together.

178
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:52,189
- Hey, Willie. - Boys!
- How ya doin'? - What's up, Chief?

179
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,775
- You know each other? - Vince Larkin.
- Sims, DEA. Good to meet you, Larkin.

180
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,777
This is our file on your man,
Francisco Cindino, son of Eduardo...

181
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:58,445
prime mover of narcotics
from Colombia.

182
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:01,615
lt's gonna be
an all-star flight.

183
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,284
This kid's a potential fountain of
information about the family business.

184
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:06,411
- Eleven and a half okay?
- Yeah.

185
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:08,747
Look at him.
Nice college boy, right?

186
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,791
We interrogated him for months.
He gave up nothing.

187
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:13,043
This is our last chance
before the FBI gets him.

188
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,170
Over my dead body
those assholes get the glory.

189
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:17,589
We pick up Mr Cindino
in Carson City.

190
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:20,551
From then until the plane hits Alabama,
we've got two hours to get him to talk.

191
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:22,553
We got you a seat right next
to him, and he's known to be...

192
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,471
somewhat garrulous
in the company of thieves.

193
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:26,598
Garrulous?
What the fuck is garrulous?

194
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:30,602
That would be loquacious, verbose,
effusive. How about "chatty"?

195
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:32,604
What's with dictionary boy,
here?

196
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:35,691
Thesaurus boy, I think,
is more appropriate.

197
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,860
- You got your gun?
- Yeah.

198
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:40,696
- Whoa, whoa. Gun?
- We got rules, gentlemen.

199
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:44,157
- Yeah. So do we. Our agents go armed.
- No one carries on this flight.

200
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:46,493
I've got a small arsenal
in the belly of the plane.

201
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:49,454
A pistol in the cockpit
lock-box. That's it.

202
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:51,456
Other than that, we keep
the plane like a prison.

203
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,542
No weapon
on the aircraft, period.

204
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,211
My man does not get on
that plane without his gun.

205
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:58,714
Then your man
doesn't get on the plane.

206
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:04,344
Okay, Willie, give it to him.

207
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:07,639
Give him the gun.

208
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:16,356
- Avoid eye contact.
- I got it.

209
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,360
- In the pen, it's a sign of aggression.
- Larkin, I got it.

210
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:22,529
Okay.

211
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,159
Foxtrot Charlie,
we are ready to disembark.

212
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:30,704
Waiting your go
on separated transfer.

213
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:33,498
Well, we told you today's flight
would be special.

214
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:37,002
- That's William Bedford, aka "Billy Bedlam."
- The mass murderer?

215
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:40,339
The same. He caught his wife in bed
with another man. Left her alone.

216
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:43,425
Drove four towns over
to his wife's family's house.

217
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:45,761
Killed her parents, her brothers, her
sisters, even her dog.

218
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:47,554
Scan him.

219
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:50,098
And who is that
good-looking brother on screen?

220
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:53,101
Nathan Jones,
aka "Diamond Dog."

221
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:55,562
Former general of
the Black Guerrillas.

222
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:58,023
He blew up a meeting of the National
Rifle Association saying...

223
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:01,735
and I quote, "They represented the
basest negativity of the white race."

224
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:05,864
He wrote a book in prison called
Reflections In A Diamond Eye.

225
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:08,450
New York Times called it "A wake-up
call for the black community."

226
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:11,203
They're talking to Denzel
for the movie.

227
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:23,715
Close door number one.

228
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:28,387
This one's done it all.
Kidnapping...

229
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,889
robbery, murder, extortion.

230
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:34,268
Foxtrot Charlie, perimeter is secured.
You are cleared to release.

231
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:40,774
His name is Cyrus Grissom,
aka "Cyrus the Virus."

232
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:44,278
Thirty-nine years old,
25 of them spent in our institutions.

233
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:48,115
But he's bettered himself inside. Earned
two degrees, including his Juris Doctor.

234
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:52,995
He also killed 11 fellow inmates,
incited three riots and escaped twice.

235
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:55,539
Likes to brag that he killed
more men than cancer.

236
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,374
Okay, open wide.

237
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,293
Lift your tongue.

238
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:06,341
Cyrus is a poster child for the criminally insane.
He's a true product of the system.

239
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:10,429
What's that supposed to mean? Uh, what
is he, one of these sociology majors...

240
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:12,973
who thinks we're responsible
for breeding these animals?

241
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:16,143
No, but I could point a few fingers
if it would make you feel comfortable.

242
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:29,781
Ah, look at this walking penis.
Boy, you are one skinny Negro.

243
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:32,201
- Easy man. Shit.
- Open up.

244
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:34,703
Oh, man, it smells like
somebody shit in your mouth.

245
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,705
He told me he loved me.

246
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:39,625
- Get out of my face.
- All right, all right. Shit.

247
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:47,007
- Hey, Larkin, who's that guy?
- That is Cameron Poe.

248
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:50,552
A parolee hitchin' a ride home.
He's a nobody.

249
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:53,597
Okay, let's do it.

250
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,893
Willie, nobody on the plane knows
your classification, not even my guards.

251
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:01,897
- Guard Bishop.
- Hey, Larkin.

252
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,024
Tell me, Skip, is
the U.S. Marshal Service...

253
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:07,069
in the habit of employing
annoying, wise-ass bookworm creeps?

254
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:08,779
Larkin's one of the best
we got.

255
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:12,324
Yeah, well, I'd still like to
crush his larynx with my boot.

256
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:17,454
Scan him.

257
00:17:17,538 --> 00:17:19,248
Face me.

258
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:26,088
- What's this shit?
- lt's my daughter.

259
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:27,881
I don't care if it's
the weepin' mama of Christ.

260
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:29,967
There's no personal possessions
on this airplane.

261
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:32,511
Just as long as you know I'll be
gettin' that back at some point.

262
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:35,430
Are you tellin' me what I'm
gonna be doin' here, numb-nuts?

263
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:37,432
- You heard me.
- Hey, hey, hey.

264
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:39,434
Come on, break it up.

265
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:46,733
Oh, now, look at this fashion statement.
The do-rag gotta go, homeboy.

266
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:51,947
- Right here.
- Attention, officers.

267
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,909
- Final check, all restraints.
- Sweet bird of freedom.

268
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:58,120
Take off in three minutes.

269
00:17:58,203 --> 00:18:02,457
What's up, man?
Oh, shit. What's up?

270
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,918
I thought you was someone else.
Pinball Parker.

271
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:09,506
Armed robber, arsonist, dope fiend. I'm
a hell of a nice guy. I just got caught.

272
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:12,676
Aw, shucks.

273
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:20,017
- All right, face me.
- I got him.

274
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:22,144
Come on.

275
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:26,148
Open.

276
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:35,824
You guys are late
for the party.

277
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:38,660
- Okay.
- Let's go, sweetheart.

278
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:46,376
What's up, Cochise?

279
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:48,712
How?

280
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:51,131
Hey, man, I'm just fuckin' with you,
all right? Don't get all...

281
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:54,092
"Wounded Knee" on me and shit.

282
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,096
You look like
you wanna scalp a nigger.

283
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:03,185
What you lookin' at, punk?

284
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:06,897
Nothin'. I was just
admirin' your cage.

285
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,899
Fits you pretty good.

286
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:13,695
Well, welcome aboard.

287
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:16,406
My, my. As I look around I see
a lot of celebrities among us.

288
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:21,537
I see 11 Current Affairs, two Hard Copies,
and a genuine Geraldo interviewee.

289
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,956
But I got to tell you,
gentlemen, none of this impresses me.

290
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:27,209
Because we have rules on this aircraft,
and they're gonna be enforced.

291
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:29,837
lt's a lot like kindergarten.
You'll keep your hands to yourself.

292
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,715
You keep the decibel level down.
And if any of you should feel the need to scream...

293
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:36,552
spit or bite,
you get the treatment.

294
00:19:36,635 --> 00:19:39,596
- Fuck you, pig.
- Gag and bag this Nazi muffin.

295
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:44,726
See, this kind of thing
puts me in a foul mood.

296
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:48,021
These rules will be enforced.
If there's a hint of trouble...

297
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:52,359
if any of you so much as passes gas in my direction,
it offends my delicate nasal passages...

298
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:56,947
your testicles will become
my personal property.

299
00:19:57,072 --> 00:20:00,659
That's pretty clear.
Good.

300
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,806
Call me Johnny 600
if they knew the truth.

301
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:26,518
Ah, doesn't have
quite the same ring to it.

302
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:29,271
Anyway, I despise rapists.

303
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:32,232
For me, you're somewhere between
a cockroach and that white stuff...

304
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:35,694
that accumulates at the corner of
your mouth when you're really thirsty.

305
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:38,405
But in your case,
I'll make an exception.

306
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:42,951
- Guard Falzon.
- What?

307
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:47,456
Oh, stewardess, stewardess?
What's the in-flight movie today?

308
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:49,208
Well, I think you'll like it,
Cyrus. lt's called...

309
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,585
I'll Never Make Love
To A Woman On The Beach Again.

310
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:56,256
And it's preceded by the award-winning
short, No More Steak For Me Ever.

311
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,552
Funny fucker, aren't ya?

312
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:07,976
Hope this goes smoothly.
All those monsters on one plane.

313
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:10,312
Please, Ginny,
this is a well-oiled machine.

314
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:13,774
The only thing we gotta worry about is
stale peanuts and a little turbulence.

315
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:18,946
Close forward gate.

316
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,294
Close middle gate.

317
00:22:18,172 --> 00:22:19,840
Come on, I need my shot!

318
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:23,135
Coming. I'm coming.
Left arm.

319
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:41,236
Hey, Chief, if you come
through this all right...

320
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,989
hope you don't hold a grudge.

321
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:46,408
What the fuck are you doin'?

322
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:54,750
Get the extinguisher.
Open the middle gate.

323
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:57,002
The Last Mohican
is burnin', man!

324
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:02,591
Shit. Did you see that motherfucker,
man? He spontaneously combusted.

325
00:23:04,635 --> 00:23:08,263
He's a fuckin' witch doctor, man.
I seen that shit on Discovery Channel.

326
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:11,099
- Code red! Code red! - Chantin' and shit.
- Fire in the rear cabin.

327
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:15,896
- I've got a fire. - Where is it?
- She's reporting it in the rear cabin.

328
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:19,525
At first I thought he was singin'
Y.M.C.A. Then the flames.

329
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:21,693
Sh-Shit!

330
00:23:33,622 --> 00:23:36,083
Holy shit!
Hold on, Bobby!

331
00:23:37,543 --> 00:23:39,503
Gimme a Taser!

332
00:23:41,922 --> 00:23:44,716
Hey, man, get off my insulin!

333
00:23:46,635 --> 00:23:49,221
Bobby, open the door!
Open the goddamn door!

334
00:23:54,268 --> 00:23:57,062
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

335
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:02,818
Pinball, go!
Pull the lever. Go! Go!

336
00:24:05,988 --> 00:24:07,948
Pinball, behind you!

337
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:13,328
Get the gun out of the lock-box,
Mack. Go on back there, check it out.

338
00:24:26,008 --> 00:24:27,676
Go! Go!

339
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:46,612
-Oh, my God. -Say there was a disturbance
but everything's under control.

340
00:24:46,695 --> 00:24:48,363
Say it, or I will kill you.

341
00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:50,657
Without me, you got nobody
to fly the plane.

342
00:24:50,741 --> 00:24:53,327
I never think that far ahead.

343
00:24:55,078 --> 00:24:57,581
All right, I'm doin' it.
Just take it easy.

344
00:24:57,706 --> 00:25:00,918
And if you say a word about this over
the radio, the next wings you see...

345
00:25:01,043 --> 00:25:05,255
will belong to the flies buzzing
over your rotting corpse.

346
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:08,675
Uh, Carson City.

347
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:11,178
Hey! Hey!

348
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:21,605
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

349
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:24,024
I have the only gun on board.

350
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:26,360
Welcome to Con Air.

351
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:38,121
- What happened?
- Roger that, Carson City.

352
00:25:38,247 --> 00:25:41,124
Calm down, Vince. Just a little ruckus,
and the pilot hit the alarm.

353
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,918
Just a little ruckus?

354
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,586
Pilot just checked in.
Everything's fine.

355
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:49,132
Transponder's confirmed,
and there's your baby.

356
00:25:49,258 --> 00:25:51,718
Damn, this pig is heavy!

357
00:25:51,802 --> 00:25:53,720
Oops.

358
00:25:58,308 --> 00:26:00,102
Shit.

359
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:02,145
If we let you out,
you gonna play nice, Billy?

360
00:26:02,271 --> 00:26:04,398
Probably not.

361
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:13,991
I got a spot on my arm
just for you.

362
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:15,784
Hey, man, yo. Come on,
get off my medication.

363
00:26:15,826 --> 00:26:18,287
I'm sorry, man.
The shit's in my way.

364
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:21,623
- I'm gonna use your whole body to make me feel good.
- All right here, man. Come on.

365
00:26:21,665 --> 00:26:23,625
All right, man.
Stop rushin'.

366
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,134
Ah, yeah.

367
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:39,308
No, no. Oh, no!
Make me hurt you.

368
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:44,104
- What you doin'?
- I can't allow that.

369
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:48,942
- You know what I am?
- Ugly all day.

370
00:26:51,445 --> 00:26:54,364
This ain't happenin',
not here, not now.

371
00:26:54,448 --> 00:26:56,325
- Oh, it's happenin'.
- Hey!

372
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:58,827
Relax. He's right.
Not here and not now.

373
00:26:58,869 --> 00:27:01,288
- Do you fly, Johnny?
- No.

374
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:03,165
You keep that in mind
when you look at her...

375
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:05,667
because if your dick
jumps out of your pants...

376
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,836
you jump out of this plane.

377
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:18,680
What are the numbers in Carson City?
How many on, how many off?

378
00:27:20,474 --> 00:27:24,019
- Six off and ten on.
- Find the six.

379
00:27:24,144 --> 00:27:26,980
Well, I know three of these brothers.
Th-They right back there.

380
00:27:27,064 --> 00:27:30,025
Uh, the other three are
Benson, Carls and Popovitch.

381
00:27:30,067 --> 00:27:34,404
- Where are they?
- That's a damn good question, Cyrus. And I'm gonna find out.

382
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,740
The pilot wants to know
what's next.

383
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:39,576
He's to land at Carson City
Airport as scheduled.

384
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:43,372
Carson City? The law is down
there. You lost your mind?

385
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:47,584
According to my last
psych evaluation, yes.

386
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:49,586
Diamond Dog, if you would.

387
00:27:51,922 --> 00:27:56,760
You think you're free?
You're not. Now, listen up.

388
00:27:56,885 --> 00:28:02,057
Forty to 50 U.S. prison guards armed with
shotguns are waitin' for us at the next stop.

389
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:05,269
Now, if you do exactly
what we tell ya...

390
00:28:05,394 --> 00:28:09,231
the rest of our lives will be a vacation
in a non-extradition country.

391
00:28:09,273 --> 00:28:14,403
I'm talkin' sandy beaches,
umbrella drinks...

392
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:16,905
and dirty, naked freaks.

393
00:28:16,947 --> 00:28:19,783
It'll be a paid
motherfuckin' vacation.

394
00:28:21,285 --> 00:28:23,120
Wait. Who's doin'
the payin'?

395
00:28:23,245 --> 00:28:25,873
Our employer,
Francisco Cindino.

396
00:28:29,126 --> 00:28:33,213
Everybody freeze. Oh, no. No,
no, no, no, no, Cyrus. No, no.

397
00:28:33,297 --> 00:28:34,882
Get that ass out here
right now!

398
00:28:34,965 --> 00:28:37,009
- With you in a second.
- Right now!

399
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:39,553
- Keep cool, boss.
- Shut up.

400
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:42,347
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm DEA. That's who the fuck I am.

401
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:47,519
- Now you were saying?
- Oh, that's very clever, Cyrus.

402
00:28:47,603 --> 00:28:50,606
So you think I give a shit about that little
bitch guard you have there right now?

403
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:54,234
Well, maybe you didn't hear what I said.
I'm DEA. You know what the fuck that means?

404
00:28:54,318 --> 00:28:56,737
- Y-You the most crooked nigger on this plane.
- Shut up.

405
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,449
You're DEA? What are you doin' on this flight?
Won't they fly you boys commercially?

406
00:29:00,574 --> 00:29:04,036
Don't push me, Cyrus, man. I swear to God, I'll
blow away your little boyfriend right now.

407
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:07,080
You know, the next time
you choose a human shield...

408
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:10,000
you're better off not pickin'
a two-bit Negro crack-head.

409
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:11,752
- Hey!
- Shut up.

410
00:29:11,835 --> 00:29:14,713
- Shoot him.
- Quiet, sweetheart.

411
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:18,133
- I think you should just stop.
- Stay back, man.

412
00:29:18,217 --> 00:29:20,761
- Stay back!
- Just stop, right? Before somebody gets killed.

413
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:23,764
- Back!
- All right, cowboy, I'm back.

414
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:27,726
- Stay back.
- You know you're in a situation you can't control, right?

415
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:30,437
I can't control it?
I can't control it?

416
00:29:30,521 --> 00:29:33,106
- You're a dead man.
- Shut the fuck up!

417
00:29:54,253 --> 00:29:56,171
What's your name, convict?

418
00:29:57,506 --> 00:30:00,133
- My name?
- Yeah.

419
00:30:00,217 --> 00:30:04,680
- Poe.
- Nice work, Poe. Truly nice work.

420
00:30:11,562 --> 00:30:13,605
Nice goin', son.

421
00:30:13,689 --> 00:30:16,316
Not only did you not save
this dude's life...

422
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,153
you done made best friends
with Cyrus the damn Virus.

423
00:30:20,237 --> 00:30:24,199
Hey, Cyrus, I, uh, I got some good news
and I got some bad news.

424
00:30:24,324 --> 00:30:28,704
-Yeah, what's the good news? -Well, the goods
news is I found Benson, Carls and Popovitch.

425
00:30:28,787 --> 00:30:30,956
- What's the bad news?
- The bad news is...

426
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,168
this dead fellow right here
happens to be Benson.

427
00:30:34,251 --> 00:30:37,504
This Aryan fellow with the bullet hole
in his forehead is, is Carls...

428
00:30:37,588 --> 00:30:42,217
and, and this honky
he's draggin' in is Popovitch.

429
00:30:42,301 --> 00:30:45,888
I don't know how to tell you this, Cyrus,
but we are three white guys short.

430
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:49,266
Or as they say in ebonics,
"We be fucked."

431
00:30:50,434 --> 00:30:53,270
Look man, I just wanna know.

432
00:30:53,395 --> 00:30:57,566
All right, you didn't... You didn't mean
that dirty-nigger crack-head shit, did you?

433
00:30:57,608 --> 00:30:59,359
Gimme that gun.

434
00:30:59,443 --> 00:31:01,528
Hell, yes, I meant it.

435
00:31:01,612 --> 00:31:05,365
Listen, Carson City is expecting
six men to get off this plane...

436
00:31:05,449 --> 00:31:07,367
and we're gonna give 'em
exactly what they expect.

437
00:31:07,451 --> 00:31:10,704
- So I need three volunteers.
- Come on, let's go, son.

438
00:31:13,624 --> 00:31:15,918
- Don't look at me, pal.
- What about her?

439
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:19,338
I'm servin' eight consecutive life sentences.
I am not getting off this plane.

440
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:22,049
I got my insulin, all right, but
they broke all the damn needles.

441
00:31:22,132 --> 00:31:24,343
If I don't get my shot
in the next couple of hours...

442
00:31:24,426 --> 00:31:26,386
- somebody gonna be sending flowers to my mother.
- Hey, I'll go.

443
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:29,014
- I'm too old for his shit.
- I mean, no offense.

444
00:31:29,097 --> 00:31:32,059
- I can take care of myself.
- I can see that.

445
00:31:32,142 --> 00:31:34,728
Go ahead, go to the back.
Anybody else?

446
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:38,357
- Hey, right here, man. Us two.
- Great, go ahead. Go to the back.

447
00:31:42,444 --> 00:31:45,906
Hey, whoa, stop. The guys
they're expecting are white.

448
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:48,033
That puts you shit out of luck.

449
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:50,494
- Hey, come on, man.
- I'll tell you what. Sit down.

450
00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:54,623
One of my associates will bring you a phone book,
and you call the Affirmative Action office.

451
00:31:54,706 --> 00:31:58,168
- You, go ahead.
- Yeah, that's it.

452
00:31:58,293 --> 00:32:02,297
- I'm gone, man. I'm dead in two hours.
- No.

453
00:32:02,381 --> 00:32:04,842
I'll get off,
scream to high heaven.

454
00:32:04,967 --> 00:32:07,469
This plane won't leave
Carson City.

455
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:14,351
We need another white boy
to volunteer.

456
00:32:14,476 --> 00:32:18,564
- Pilot's white.
- Wait, wait, wait. The pilot?

457
00:32:18,689 --> 00:32:24,236
- Who's gonna fly the plane?
- Relax, Billy. Welcome to the machine.

458
00:32:24,361 --> 00:32:28,824
- You rang?
- Carson City says we got a hell of a sandstorm down there.

459
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,660
Perfect.

460
00:32:33,245 --> 00:32:34,705
Crazy.

461
00:32:40,711 --> 00:32:43,881
Vacant cell D8,
ready for inspection.

462
00:32:46,758 --> 00:32:48,844
Last tenant, Cyrus Grissom.

463
00:32:48,927 --> 00:32:52,014
Got scratches on the wall.
Probably a weapon sharpening.

464
00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:55,225
- What about the loose shelf screw?
- What the hell is this?

465
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:57,269
Looks like cocaine.

466
00:33:01,732 --> 00:33:05,611
- What, do you got something there?
- I don't know. lt's all soft.

467
00:33:10,324 --> 00:33:12,409
What about the rest
of the pigs?

468
00:33:12,492 --> 00:33:16,955
Be patient, now. They haven't
ceased to be useful yet.

469
00:33:16,997 --> 00:33:19,583
Okay, old man.
Now you're Mr Popovitch.

470
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:23,337
Gentlemen, you'll reach the
Nevada pen in about two hours.

471
00:33:23,462 --> 00:33:25,672
The tape's just a little
precaution in case any of you...

472
00:33:25,797 --> 00:33:30,177
are rocked by the sudden impulse
to squeal like a pig.

473
00:33:30,302 --> 00:33:34,139
Not that we don't trust you.
But let's face it, you're criminals.

474
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:39,269
- Come on, man, move your head up.
- I want to stay on.

475
00:33:39,353 --> 00:33:40,979
What?

476
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:43,857
I changed my mind.

477
00:33:43,982 --> 00:33:47,152
So, Cyrus, we got
a little mind-changer.

478
00:33:47,194 --> 00:33:50,531
I got 15 years left, and
I know I'd just hate myself...

479
00:33:50,656 --> 00:33:53,617
if I thought I blew my one shot
at a naked party freak...

480
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,119
and, and an umbrella drink.

481
00:33:56,203 --> 00:33:59,498
You got 15 years? Boy, a second ago
you couldn't wait to get off this plane.

482
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:03,293
I know.
Fear of freedom, I guess.

483
00:34:06,713 --> 00:34:10,133
Get him up.
Get the cuffs off him.

484
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:13,470
Pick out a guard, and then put that
dead cop's prison issues on him.

485
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:18,141
- What the hell are you doin'?
- Stayin'.

486
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:21,061
They're gaggin' everybody
for the bus ride to the pen.

487
00:34:21,186 --> 00:34:24,648
It'll be hours before the Feds discover
what happened. By then you'll be dead.

488
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:30,153
- So will she.
- Poe, think of your little girl.

489
00:34:30,237 --> 00:34:34,700
Now, what would my daughter think of me if I
left you like this to get dishonored and die?

490
00:34:34,741 --> 00:34:37,661
You keep acting like you're still
a Ranger, we're all gonna be in trouble.

491
00:34:37,744 --> 00:34:40,873
You're not that guy anymore.
You're a convict.

492
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,379
Dear God!

493
00:34:49,173 --> 00:34:52,593
- Told you I'd get that back.
- Fuck you, trailer trash.

494
00:34:52,718 --> 00:34:57,181
Hey, my mama lives in a trailer. Now
put those on. I just saved your life.

495
00:34:59,892 --> 00:35:02,227
Okay, soldier boy.
You got a plan?

496
00:35:04,104 --> 00:35:06,064
Maybe.

497
00:35:20,537 --> 00:35:24,249
Chief? I got a lot
of weird shit down here.

498
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:26,710
- What is it?
- This looks like the drawing of a plane.

499
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:30,881
- Whose cell is that?
- The Virus.

500
00:35:57,324 --> 00:35:58,951
Open up!

501
00:36:15,008 --> 00:36:17,761
My daughter's picture. Where'd
you put my daughter's picture...

502
00:36:17,845 --> 00:36:20,764
you shit-eatin'
pecker-head?

503
00:36:30,482 --> 00:36:32,776
Heard you had a problem
up there.

504
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:37,489
Had to bag 'em and gag 'em.
Rough crew. Spitters and shitters.

505
00:36:42,995 --> 00:36:46,290
On the bus, dick-head!
On the bus!

506
00:36:59,094 --> 00:37:00,804
Let's go.
We're at the gate.

507
00:37:06,935 --> 00:37:10,647
They took the plane. You hear that,
boys? We got the plane, man.

508
00:37:10,689 --> 00:37:14,026
Shut the fuck up, curly, all
right? You gonna get us caught!

509
00:37:14,151 --> 00:37:16,612
No way, Jose!

510
00:37:16,695 --> 00:37:19,323
You gotta be kiddin' me.

511
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:21,658
Oh, boy.

512
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:28,832
In Spanish from Bogota, Colombia.
Looks like it's from a law firm.

513
00:37:43,889 --> 00:37:46,850
Orange and black.

514
00:37:48,727 --> 00:37:50,979
What's up, man?

515
00:37:51,063 --> 00:37:53,357
- So, you the Swamp Thing?
- That's right.

516
00:37:53,398 --> 00:37:56,652
- Flyin' the plane?
- That's right.

517
00:37:56,693 --> 00:38:00,864
- lt's amazing the shit you white trash know.
- That's right.

518
00:38:03,575 --> 00:38:06,703
Shit! Aw, man!

519
00:38:35,107 --> 00:38:37,067
What're you doin' here?

520
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:42,364
Hello.
How you doin', baby?

521
00:38:42,447 --> 00:38:45,576
I'm just, uh, tryin' to get out of
the storm, you know. Grab my lunch.

522
00:38:45,617 --> 00:38:48,787
- Well, this is a restricted area.
- Look, don't worry, baby.

523
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:52,583
- lt's all right. I'm a... I'm a cop.
- You work for a prison or somethin'?

524
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:56,920
Yeah, the Department of Erect...
Corrections. Caught me slippin'.

525
00:38:57,963 --> 00:38:59,923
Creepy.

526
00:38:59,965 --> 00:39:02,801
The eyes are cut
out of their heads.

527
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:09,308
The Last Supper.

528
00:39:11,643 --> 00:39:13,604
- ls that it?
- One more.

529
00:39:14,646 --> 00:39:16,440
Late addition.

530
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:18,650
- Who?
- Garland Greene.

531
00:39:19,651 --> 00:39:21,445
Should be interesting.

532
00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:46,678
- What the fuck is that?
- That's Garland Greene, man.

533
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,522
Christ in a cartoon!

534
00:39:56,647 --> 00:39:58,607
Shit, that's
Garland Greene, man.

535
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:00,526
The Marietta Mangler.

536
00:40:00,651 --> 00:40:02,819
That skinny little man
butchered 30 somethin' people...

537
00:40:02,945 --> 00:40:05,197
up and down
the eastern seaboard.

538
00:40:05,322 --> 00:40:07,199
They say the way
he killed those people...

539
00:40:07,324 --> 00:40:10,369
makes the Manson family
look like the Partridge family.

540
00:40:11,703 --> 00:40:15,290
Well, he's on the right flight.

541
00:40:15,374 --> 00:40:17,501
- But you know what, you really do need to leave.
- Tina, you've got...

542
00:40:17,543 --> 00:40:20,838
the prettiest eyes I've seen
in about five to ten.

543
00:40:30,055 --> 00:40:32,808
"Met ca... Me...
Me. Et cetera.

544
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:35,811
Cetera. Meet.""

545
00:40:35,894 --> 00:40:39,857
Me, et cetera, me arson.
Meet car. Meet cars. Meet cars.

546
00:40:39,982 --> 00:40:42,985
Meet cars. Meet cars.
Meet cars. Where?

547
00:40:45,404 --> 00:40:48,323
"Carson...

548
00:40:49,533 --> 00:40:51,994
City.""

549
00:40:52,077 --> 00:40:56,915
Oh, God. Uh, stay here.
Don't touch anything.

550
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:06,341
Hey, what're you doin'? Just leave it alone.
He told you not to touch anything.

551
00:41:28,614 --> 00:41:31,575
What the hell?

552
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:38,707
You wanna have some more fun,
keep it up.

553
00:41:59,311 --> 00:42:00,979
Come on.

554
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:14,660
We've got a situation here, sir.
Somebody better call the marshal's office.

555
00:42:18,121 --> 00:42:20,582
Code red! Code red!
Starkey, those guards ain't guards.

556
00:42:20,666 --> 00:42:23,502
- They're cons. Stall 'em.
- Christ!

557
00:42:36,181 --> 00:42:38,976
- Hey, how are ya?
- Almost ready?

558
00:42:39,017 --> 00:42:42,604
Won't be long now.

559
00:42:52,531 --> 00:42:56,201
- You're the man, Cyrus!
- Let's go!

560
00:43:03,542 --> 00:43:06,378
Do you hear somethin'
that sounds like a damn plane?

561
00:43:12,009 --> 00:43:14,344
Jailbird One, you are
not cleared for takeoff.

562
00:43:14,386 --> 00:43:17,848
Hey, nobody on this aircraft
gives a flyin' fuck!

563
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:21,476
Get it? "Flyin' fuck!"
Thank you. I'm here all week.

564
00:43:25,397 --> 00:43:28,317
Hey! Hey, Cochise,
it's me!

565
00:43:28,358 --> 00:43:32,029
Pinball. I'm sorry.
Hey!

566
00:43:40,913 --> 00:43:43,040
Shine, sweet freedom, shine!

567
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:54,927
Trust me, folks. This is gonna be
a day you will never forget.

568
00:43:55,052 --> 00:43:58,889
Just step right on board
and find yourself a seat.

569
00:44:02,434 --> 00:44:04,728
Don't they have a way
of tracking these planes?

570
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:08,565
Oh, yeah. lt's called a transponder.
Every plane's got one, Cindino.

571
00:44:08,607 --> 00:44:12,027
Swamp, where is
the transponder?

572
00:44:15,614 --> 00:44:17,866
Where indeed?

573
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,789
Are, are you sure it's safe
to fly in this?

574
00:44:23,914 --> 00:44:27,876
No problem. I've done this a thousand times.
We'll be through this in a few minutes.

575
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,045
You all right back there,
ladies?

576
00:44:32,714 --> 00:44:35,300
We're following the transponder.
We know exactly where they're heading.

577
00:44:36,635 --> 00:44:38,762
What the fuck happened?

578
00:44:38,887 --> 00:44:41,056
What about Sims?
What happened to Sims?

579
00:44:41,139 --> 00:44:43,600
Duncan, they killed him.

580
00:44:43,642 --> 00:44:45,644
They got the plane.

581
00:44:57,656 --> 00:45:01,243
Tell me, Skip, what kind of a Keystone Cops
operation are you guys runnin' here, huh?

582
00:45:01,285 --> 00:45:04,079
And you! You, you little shit.
You got my agent killed!

583
00:45:04,162 --> 00:45:06,123
Hey, he brought a gun
on the plane.

584
00:45:06,164 --> 00:45:09,126
If I knew the way you guys run things, I
would've told him bring a fuckin' uzi on board!

585
00:45:09,168 --> 00:45:12,754
No one carries on these flights!
No one!

586
00:45:12,838 --> 00:45:14,590
He brought a gun on board
and he got himself killed.

587
00:45:14,631 --> 00:45:16,466
And in doing so, he compromised
the safety of my men!

588
00:45:16,592 --> 00:45:18,969
Your men are incompetent!

589
00:45:19,011 --> 00:45:22,306
They let themselves get taken over by
a bunch of thugs in chains and cages!

590
00:45:22,347 --> 00:45:24,308
- I'm not gonna stand around...
- Guys! - and listen to this shit!

591
00:45:24,349 --> 00:45:27,644
Guys, guys.
Let's work it out.

592
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,106
Okay. Okay.

593
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:36,528
So, uh, what do we do now?

594
00:45:36,653 --> 00:45:38,697
What's the plan? You, uh,
you-you-you do have a plan, don't you?

595
00:45:38,822 --> 00:45:40,699
We're workin' on it.

596
00:45:40,824 --> 00:45:43,452
Contingency plans for something
like this don't exist.

597
00:45:43,535 --> 00:45:46,496
- The situation's never been contemplated.
- Well, you better start contemplating...

598
00:45:46,622 --> 00:45:51,835
'cause this is a situation that
needs to get unfucked right now!

599
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:55,547
I want a chopper. Make that a few
of 'em. They need to be armed.

600
00:45:55,672 --> 00:45:58,967
I don't care if it's National
Guard, Air Force, whatever.

601
00:45:59,009 --> 00:46:01,011
Just get 'em here,
and get 'em here now.

602
00:46:04,848 --> 00:46:07,184
- What do you want to do with him?
- I don't know.

603
00:46:07,226 --> 00:46:11,188
But this is no way to treat
a national treasure. Let him out.

604
00:46:12,481 --> 00:46:15,859
- You sure?
- Love your work.

605
00:46:46,056 --> 00:46:49,518
They're headed southeast
toward Arizona.

606
00:46:57,609 --> 00:47:01,572
- Pinball didn't make it.
- No?

607
00:47:01,697 --> 00:47:05,367
That's too bad.
I liked Pinball.

608
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:08,704
- What do you want?
- I wanna know what the plan is.

609
00:47:08,745 --> 00:47:11,248
Why you care?

610
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:15,127
I got just as much ridin' on this
as you. We're all convicts here.

611
00:47:15,252 --> 00:47:17,212
Cyrus Grissom, do you copy?

612
00:47:17,296 --> 00:47:19,381
Cyrus Grissom, do you copy?

613
00:47:19,423 --> 00:47:22,551
Yes, I copy.
Identify yourself.

614
00:47:22,593 --> 00:47:26,430
This is United States Marshal Vince
Larkin and Duncan Malloy of the DEA.

615
00:47:26,471 --> 00:47:30,058
Oh, Agent Malloy. I'm so sorry
about your associate.

616
00:47:30,142 --> 00:47:33,645
Nothing is quite as sad as seeing
a grown man pissing his pants.

617
00:47:33,729 --> 00:47:35,939
Listen, Grissom,
you puny, fucking animal!

618
00:47:36,064 --> 00:47:38,734
When I get through with you, you'll be
beggin' 'em for the electric chair.

619
00:47:38,775 --> 00:47:40,903
Hey, I don't like him.

620
00:47:40,944 --> 00:47:43,947
If he speaks again, this
conversation is terminated.

621
00:47:44,072 --> 00:47:48,619
He doesn't want to talk again. Really.
He's done talking. He's leaving the building, okay?

622
00:47:48,744 --> 00:47:51,205
Good, then I'll talk to you.
Here are the rules.

623
00:47:51,288 --> 00:47:54,082
First I ask a question,
then you ask a question.

624
00:47:54,124 --> 00:47:55,792
Okay.
What's your question?

625
00:47:55,918 --> 00:47:59,087
In Carson City, your bulls
were onto us. How?

626
00:47:59,129 --> 00:48:02,424
- One of the guards...
- One of the guards...

627
00:48:02,466 --> 00:48:06,428
One of the guards faked a heart attack
and we had to remove his restraints.

628
00:48:06,553 --> 00:48:08,597
All right?

629
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:10,599
I see.
And what's your question?

630
00:48:10,641 --> 00:48:12,935
Where you goin'
with my plane, Cyrus?

631
00:48:12,976 --> 00:48:15,979
- We're going to Disneyland.
- You're lying, Cyrus.

632
00:48:16,104 --> 00:48:20,275
So are you, Vince.
Oh, nothin'

633
00:48:20,317 --> 00:48:24,780
Makes me sadder than the agent
lost his bladder in the

634
00:48:24,821 --> 00:48:27,157
Airplane

635
00:48:29,618 --> 00:48:33,288
Lerner Airfield, Poe. Middle of nowhere.
That's our rendezvous point.

636
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:36,750
Forty-nine minutes from anything
resembling authority.

637
00:48:36,834 --> 00:48:39,294
So, now you know.

638
00:48:39,336 --> 00:48:42,089
Your attention, please.
Flight 475...

639
00:48:42,172 --> 00:48:45,801
You excited? Yeah?
Sure look pretty.

640
00:48:51,849 --> 00:48:54,476
- Mrs. Poe?
- That's right.

641
00:48:54,518 --> 00:48:57,145
My name's Grant,
U.S. Marshal Service.

642
00:48:57,271 --> 00:49:01,149
There's been a slight problem on your husband's flight.
Your presence is requested.

643
00:49:01,191 --> 00:49:03,861
I have a jet standing by.

644
00:49:10,033 --> 00:49:13,871
Yee-ha!
What's on your mind, hillbilly?

645
00:49:13,954 --> 00:49:17,374
What was I thinking about?

646
00:49:17,457 --> 00:49:20,002
Oh, yeah. Yee-ha.
That's right.

647
00:49:20,043 --> 00:49:24,006
I was just wonderin' what a black
militant, uh, that would be you...

648
00:49:24,131 --> 00:49:27,551
was doin' takin' orders from
a white boy on a power trip.

649
00:49:27,676 --> 00:49:31,638
- Don't you think that's strange?
- lt's a means to an end, my white friend.

650
00:49:31,847 --> 00:49:34,183
A means to an end.
See...

651
00:49:34,224 --> 00:49:37,686
I's can play house nigger till's
we get to where we're goin'.

652
00:49:37,728 --> 00:49:42,191
And then,
the day of the dog begins.

653
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,535
So what was that all about?

654
00:49:53,577 --> 00:49:56,371
Oh, nothin',
except they somehow managed...

655
00:49:56,413 --> 00:50:00,709
to get every creep and freak
in the universe onto this one plane...

656
00:50:00,751 --> 00:50:04,838
and then somehow managed
to let them take it over...

657
00:50:04,922 --> 00:50:09,051
and then somehow managed to stick us
right smack in the middle.

658
00:50:16,099 --> 00:50:17,726
Hi, Garland.

659
00:50:20,687 --> 00:50:24,608
Here's the jacket on Cameron Poe.
His wife's on the way here now.

660
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:26,610
U.S. Ranger,
highly decorated.

661
00:50:26,693 --> 00:50:28,529
Did a little hell-raising when
he was a kid, but nothing serious.

662
00:50:28,612 --> 00:50:30,906
Explain to me
why any of this matters.

663
00:50:30,948 --> 00:50:33,450
Fact one. We got a plane up there filled
with killers, rapists and thieves...

664
00:50:33,575 --> 00:50:36,578
and we got this guy Cameron Poe,
in on an involuntary manslaughter beef.

665
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:39,623
Non-gang affiliated. He's
a parolee hitchin' a ride home.

666
00:50:39,706 --> 00:50:43,252
Fact two. Poe has a chance
to get off the plane.

667
00:50:43,377 --> 00:50:45,879
Doesn't do it. Why?

668
00:50:45,963 --> 00:50:49,591
Fact three. Our guard, Falzon,
said a convict named Cameron Poe...

669
00:50:49,716 --> 00:50:51,969
planted Sims's
tape recorder on him.

670
00:50:52,135 --> 00:50:56,682
These are interesting facts. You do the math
on this, and we got an ally on that plane.

671
00:50:56,765 --> 00:51:00,352
Ally? This guy is a criminal.
A murderer.

672
00:51:00,394 --> 00:51:05,148
Read the file. Got in a drunken brawl
defending his wife and he killed a guy.

673
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:06,441
Could have happened to any one
of us, including you and me.

674
00:51:06,483 --> 00:51:08,193
I am not one of these animals.

675
00:51:08,277 --> 00:51:10,946
Oh, that's original! When exactly
did they all become animals?

676
00:51:11,029 --> 00:51:14,241
When they stopped giving a damn
about the law, about civilization.

677
00:51:14,324 --> 00:51:18,245
"The degree of civilization in a society
can be judged by observing its prisoners."

678
00:51:18,328 --> 00:51:21,248
Dostoevsky said that
after doing a little time.

679
00:51:21,331 --> 00:51:26,086
"Fuck you!" Cyrus Grissom said that after
putting a bullet in my agent's head. Okay?

680
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:28,589
The issue here is how the plane
is brought down.

681
00:51:28,672 --> 00:51:30,632
Shoot it down.

682
00:51:30,716 --> 00:51:34,720
Yeah. When exactly did this
become a DEA jurisdiction?

683
00:51:34,803 --> 00:51:37,431
The second the DEA agent
was murdered.

684
00:51:37,514 --> 00:51:40,267
I am authorized to bring Agent Sims's
killers to justice using...

685
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:43,312
and I quote,
"All necessary means."

686
00:51:43,395 --> 00:51:46,315
- That does not include shooting down my plane.
- Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.

687
00:51:46,398 --> 00:51:49,151
ls that right? Tell me you're
not seriously entertaining this.

688
00:51:49,234 --> 00:51:51,945
Vince, this is
a drastic situation we got.

689
00:51:52,029 --> 00:51:55,490
-Those are our men up there! -All of whom signed
a no-hostage clause. They know the score.

690
00:51:55,616 --> 00:51:59,036
Who are you to decide the value of a man's life?
There are innocent people up there!

691
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:02,623
About time.

692
00:52:02,706 --> 00:52:06,293
- For what? About time for what?
- Attack choppers. We're going after 'em.

693
00:52:11,924 --> 00:52:15,135
Goddamn it!
Skip, don't do this!

694
00:52:15,219 --> 00:52:18,180
This man is in an irrational state
of mind! His head isn't on straight.

695
00:52:18,305 --> 00:52:22,142
Fuck off, Marshal Larkin.
Your job's finished. This flight's full.

696
00:52:31,401 --> 00:52:36,156
Gentlemen, in roughly five hours, we will
be flying over the shores of Mexico.

697
00:52:36,281 --> 00:52:39,159
But first we have
to change aircraft.

698
00:52:39,284 --> 00:52:41,662
Thank you, and have
a pleasant flight.

699
00:52:41,703 --> 00:52:46,834
- What's the ETA, Swamp Thing?
- At 228 miles an hour, about 71 minutes.

700
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:50,546
The only problem is, we're not doing
228 miles an hour. We're doing 205.

701
00:52:50,671 --> 00:52:54,341
We're draggin', baby. The landing gear
ain't all the way up. We're gonna be late.

702
00:52:54,383 --> 00:52:57,845
- No, no, no. Cyrus, that's unacceptable.
- Check out the gear.

703
00:52:57,886 --> 00:53:00,681
- What the hell do I know about landing gear?
- Learn.

704
00:53:03,892 --> 00:53:05,894
Hillbilly!

705
00:53:05,978 --> 00:53:07,855
Poe.

706
00:53:12,484 --> 00:53:16,363
- Yeah?
- Cyrus wants you to check out the landing gear.

707
00:53:16,488 --> 00:53:19,533
Then I'll get to see some nice
scenery whippin' by down there.

708
00:53:24,997 --> 00:53:26,874
Trees and stuff.

709
00:53:47,102 --> 00:53:50,230
Goddamn! So that's
what happened to Pinball.

710
00:53:50,272 --> 00:53:53,567
Cut him loose. He's slowin'
us down. Dead weight.

711
00:53:53,609 --> 00:53:56,236
Not exactly a proper burial.

712
00:53:56,361 --> 00:53:58,780
Look at our shit over there.

713
00:54:18,926 --> 00:54:20,302
Hurry up.

714
00:54:22,888 --> 00:54:24,932
Hillbilly.

715
00:54:25,057 --> 00:54:26,642
Gotcha.

716
00:54:27,935 --> 00:54:30,437
Hurry up, man.

717
00:54:36,235 --> 00:54:38,153
Bye, Pinball.

718
00:54:52,292 --> 00:54:55,295
Oh, boy! You see that?
You see?

719
00:54:55,420 --> 00:55:00,467
Every time we get her waxed, I get ten feet
from the car wash and then, pow, bird shit.

720
00:55:00,592 --> 00:55:03,971
Well, it's supposed to be
good luck.

721
00:55:06,098 --> 00:55:08,600
- Light's changed.
- Oh, damn.

722
00:55:31,748 --> 00:55:34,001
- You were in the "Q, " right?
- Yeah.

723
00:55:34,084 --> 00:55:37,546
And I heard you say
you had 15 years.

724
00:55:38,839 --> 00:55:40,507
That's right.

725
00:55:40,549 --> 00:55:44,678
But then that would put you
on north block. Right?

726
00:55:44,761 --> 00:55:47,723
Yeah.

727
00:55:47,848 --> 00:55:50,392
Yeah. Funny thing.

728
00:55:50,517 --> 00:55:55,355
I was on north block.
I don't know you.

729
00:55:55,439 --> 00:55:58,859
Well, you know what, uh, pal?

730
00:55:58,901 --> 00:56:03,530
What do you think that means?
Nothin'. Not diddly shit.

731
00:56:03,614 --> 00:56:06,033
You see, there were 160 cats
on north block...

732
00:56:06,074 --> 00:56:10,537
and I didn't want to know 159
of them, which included you.

733
00:56:10,579 --> 00:56:13,081
What do you think about that?

734
00:56:13,123 --> 00:56:15,083
Yeah.

735
00:56:23,091 --> 00:56:25,761
He's a font of misplaced rage.

736
00:56:25,886 --> 00:56:30,265
Name your cliche. Mother held
him too much, or not enough.

737
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:33,101
Last picked at kick ball,
late-night sneaky uncle. Whatever.

738
00:56:34,978 --> 00:56:38,774
Now he's so angry, moments of
levity actually cause him pain.

739
00:56:39,942 --> 00:56:41,568
Gives him headaches.

740
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:44,279
Happiness, for
that gentleman, hurts.

741
00:56:45,405 --> 00:56:47,449
What's wrong with him?

742
00:56:47,574 --> 00:56:50,744
My first thought would be
a lot.

743
00:56:53,497 --> 00:56:55,165
- Hello.
- Hello.

744
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:57,501
- Hi. I'm, I'm Vince Larkin.
- I'm Tricia Poe.

745
00:56:57,626 --> 00:57:01,171
Nice to meet ya.
This, this must be Casey.

746
00:57:01,296 --> 00:57:04,091
- Hello, Casey. - Hello, Vince Larkin.
- Nice to meet ya.

747
00:57:05,175 --> 00:57:07,135
So how are you doin'?

748
00:57:07,261 --> 00:57:09,596
I'm sorry. That's, uh... Scratch
that. Dumb question. You...

749
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:13,141
You wanted to see your husband today,
and then this whole thing happened.

750
00:57:13,267 --> 00:57:16,603
Maybe you could just tell me
exactly what's going on here and...

751
00:57:16,645 --> 00:57:19,648
We're doing everything we can
to get the plane down.

752
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:22,776
Actually, that's w-why I wanted
to talk to you.

753
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:29,491
Hey, wait. W-Where'd you get
the rims, man?

754
00:57:29,616 --> 00:57:32,619
My personal shit's
down in the belly.

755
00:57:34,454 --> 00:57:37,040
- Hey, those are my shades.
- They're mine now, sister.

756
00:57:37,165 --> 00:57:39,126
Men!

757
00:57:45,299 --> 00:57:49,136
lt seems that your husband,
Cameron...

758
00:57:49,219 --> 00:57:51,638
had an opportunity to get off
the plane and he didn't do it.

759
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,308
And I was hoping you could...

760
00:57:54,391 --> 00:57:57,978
maybe help me figure out why.

761
00:57:58,061 --> 00:58:01,481
That would make two of us.
I don't know.

762
00:58:01,523 --> 00:58:03,567
I mean, it's possible,
it's, it's not uncommon...

763
00:58:03,692 --> 00:58:07,571
that some parolees actually fear
their release date.

764
00:58:07,696 --> 00:58:11,325
A certain degree of institutionalization
sets in. Fear of coming home.

765
00:58:11,408 --> 00:58:13,911
- Fear of living in society. Any of this make sense?
- No, no.

766
00:58:14,036 --> 00:58:17,831
That's not Cameron. I mean, if you, if
you knew him, if you read his letters...

767
00:58:17,873 --> 00:58:20,667
or if you talked to him
on the phone, you'd know that...

768
00:58:20,751 --> 00:58:25,005
I mean, he's been waitin' for this day
for eight years. He's not gonna...

769
00:58:27,424 --> 00:58:32,012
I mean, look, he's got this little,
this little girl to come home to.

770
00:58:33,889 --> 00:58:36,183
Wouldn't you...

771
00:58:36,266 --> 00:58:38,352
do the same thing?

772
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:44,358
There'd have to be a pretty strong
reason to keep me on that plane.

773
00:58:44,441 --> 00:58:47,528
Well, knowing Cameron,
I'm sure there is a good reason.

774
00:58:49,696 --> 00:58:54,451
Uh, maybe, if you, if you do
see him or if you talk to him...

775
00:58:54,576 --> 00:58:58,747
maybe you could just tell him
to come home, all right?

776
00:58:58,872 --> 00:59:01,291
Be kinda nice
to have him around.

777
00:59:02,251 --> 00:59:04,253
You got it.

778
00:59:05,295 --> 00:59:07,464
Vince, line one.

779
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,885
This body fell out of the sky.

780
00:59:11,927 --> 00:59:16,223
Vince Larkin? This is Ted Grasso,
Fresno Police Department.

781
00:59:16,306 --> 00:59:18,642
We got a problem here
with a corpse.

782
00:59:20,102 --> 00:59:21,770
Yeah, it fell out of the sky.

783
00:59:21,895 --> 00:59:23,814
I don't think
he's an astronaut.

784
00:59:23,939 --> 00:59:26,942
Then what's this got
to do with me?

785
00:59:27,067 --> 00:59:29,736
lt's got your name
written all over it.

786
00:59:35,075 --> 00:59:37,911
Last transponder tag
was in Arizona.

787
00:59:37,953 --> 00:59:40,330
Body falls here, in Fresno.

788
00:59:40,455 --> 00:59:43,250
Lerner Airfield.
They're turning around.

789
00:59:43,292 --> 00:59:44,918
- They're coming back. Can you get me Chief...
- Devers.

790
00:59:45,002 --> 00:59:46,962
Please. Thank you.

791
00:59:47,087 --> 00:59:49,339
- Vince?
- Turn around.

792
00:59:49,464 --> 00:59:52,259
Plane's headed to Lerner Airfield. lt's
a small strip about 100 miles from here.

793
00:59:52,342 --> 00:59:56,138
Horse-shit! We're tailing the
transponder tag into Arizona.

794
00:59:56,263 --> 00:59:58,599
Listen to me.
A body fell from the sky.

795
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,101
lt had a note on it.

796
01:00:01,143 --> 01:00:04,146
We got 'em vectored
at 12:00 and 30 miles.

797
01:00:04,271 --> 01:00:08,275
- Vince, please, son. We're right on his tail.
- Just listen to me!

798
01:00:08,358 --> 01:00:10,777
lt was to me!
The note on the body was to me!

799
01:00:10,819 --> 01:00:13,030
- You're chasing the wrong...
- Aw, shut up.

800
01:00:13,155 --> 01:00:14,448
Hello?

801
01:00:16,158 --> 01:00:18,785
Guys, guys! I need a plane
or a chopper now!

802
01:00:18,827 --> 01:00:21,330
Hey, you and me both.
I'm all out.

803
01:00:21,371 --> 01:00:24,124
I've got to get to Lerner Airfield
and I've got about 50 minutes.

804
01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:26,335
Got a fast car,
you can drive it.

805
01:00:30,297 --> 01:00:32,716
Larkin. Vince Larkin.
I'm with the Marshal Services.

806
01:00:32,841 --> 01:00:35,469
Send whatever you got. Sheriff,
state trooper, national guard.

807
01:00:35,511 --> 01:00:37,971
Hold on one minute.

808
01:00:40,724 --> 01:00:43,227
Your men should proceed
with extreme caution.

809
01:00:43,352 --> 01:00:45,812
lt's only a matter of time
before they find the weapons hold.

810
01:00:50,234 --> 01:00:52,903
Larkin. Vince Larkin.
Marshal Services.

811
01:00:53,028 --> 01:00:54,905
How do you think
I got the number?

812
01:01:00,744 --> 01:01:04,206
"...appears to the United States
Parole Commission that..."

813
01:01:05,791 --> 01:01:07,918
Poe.

814
01:01:08,043 --> 01:01:11,380
Man! Oh, yeah!

815
01:01:13,048 --> 01:01:15,551
Put the bunny back in the box.

816
01:01:17,594 --> 01:01:21,181
I knew you was a punk.
And I was right.

817
01:01:21,265 --> 01:01:24,434
You been playin' us all along.

818
01:01:24,518 --> 01:01:27,062
You a free man.

819
01:01:27,145 --> 01:01:31,024
I said, put the bunny...

820
01:01:31,108 --> 01:01:33,610
back in the box.

821
01:02:04,766 --> 01:02:06,977
Die, punk!

822
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:19,072
Why couldn't you put the bunny
back in the box?

823
01:02:21,491 --> 01:02:25,162
Next, folks, below and to your left,
you'll see the vertical Renoir Cliffs.

824
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:31,126
We're seconds away from
establishing visual contact.

825
01:02:33,045 --> 01:02:35,839
Holy shit!

826
01:02:35,923 --> 01:02:39,092
Abort! Abort! Abort!

827
01:02:39,176 --> 01:02:44,014
If that aircraft's carrying
30 prisoners, I'm Elvis Presley.

828
01:02:45,057 --> 01:02:47,935
"Uncle Bob's Scenic Tours."

829
01:02:49,645 --> 01:02:52,898
Shit!

830
01:02:52,981 --> 01:02:56,902
Three hundred fuckin' miles
to apprehend Ma and Pa fucking Kettle!

831
01:02:56,985 --> 01:02:59,821
We need to get
to Lerner Airfield now!

832
01:02:59,905 --> 01:03:02,115
Get me Vince Larkin.

833
01:03:12,417 --> 01:03:14,837
Two went down, one came up.

834
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:18,173
- Wasn't my fault.
- Well, you don't have to tell me.

835
01:03:18,257 --> 01:03:21,009
Most murders are crimes
of necessity rather than desire.

836
01:03:21,093 --> 01:03:25,347
But the great ones,
Dahmer, Gacy, Bundy...

837
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:27,766
- they did it because it excited them.
- Don't you...

838
01:03:29,726 --> 01:03:31,854
I got nothing in common
with them, with you.

839
01:03:31,937 --> 01:03:35,399
Don't you talk to me!
They were insane.

840
01:03:35,524 --> 01:03:39,027
Now you're talking semantics.

841
01:03:39,111 --> 01:03:43,031
What if I told you insane was working 50
hours a week in some office for 50 years...

842
01:03:43,115 --> 01:03:45,868
at the end of which
they tell you to piss off?

843
01:03:45,951 --> 01:03:48,370
Ending up
in some retirement village...

844
01:03:48,453 --> 01:03:52,875
hoping to die before suffering the indignity
of trying to make it to the toilet on time.

845
01:03:54,543 --> 01:03:56,795
Wouldn't you consider that
to be insane?

846
01:03:56,879 --> 01:04:02,551
Murdering 30 people,
semantics or not, is insane!

847
01:04:04,219 --> 01:04:06,054
One girl...

848
01:04:06,138 --> 01:04:08,223
I drove through three states
wearing her head as a hat.

849
01:04:08,307 --> 01:04:11,268
lt's my daughter's birthday
today.

850
01:04:11,351 --> 01:04:14,438
So please feel free
not to share everything with me.

851
01:05:15,499 --> 01:05:19,503
All right, you damn pecker-woods,
crack the knuckles and hit the crystals.

852
01:05:19,586 --> 01:05:21,922
We're putting this baby
down in a sandbox.

853
01:05:30,931 --> 01:05:33,851
Lerner Tower, do you copy?

854
01:05:33,934 --> 01:05:37,020
Lerner Tower,
are you there, Phil?

855
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:43,485
Come on, answer me.

856
01:05:43,569 --> 01:05:46,154
I am landing.

857
01:06:14,433 --> 01:06:16,476
Oh, my God.

858
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,729
Look out!

859
01:07:33,136 --> 01:07:35,973
Lerner Airfield.
I'm so glad to be here.

860
01:07:39,184 --> 01:07:41,937
Thank you for choosing Con Air.

861
01:07:43,814 --> 01:07:47,985
- Where's the plane, Francisco?
- I don't know. Have patience.

862
01:07:48,068 --> 01:07:51,905
The last guy who told me to have patience?
I burned him down, and bagged his ashes.

863
01:07:51,989 --> 01:07:53,991
Cyrus, it'll be here.

864
01:08:01,373 --> 01:08:05,085
Hey, you stupid sons of bitches!
Jesus Christ!

865
01:08:11,091 --> 01:08:13,635
I hope he likes sand.

866
01:08:13,719 --> 01:08:17,014
-Muchacho, run and check out the tower.
Have a look-see, yeah? -All right.

867
01:08:17,097 --> 01:08:18,932
You come with us.

868
01:08:23,353 --> 01:08:25,981
- Let's go. We're gettin' off.
- Boss, I can't. - Yes, you can. Come on!

869
01:08:26,064 --> 01:08:28,692
- You shouldn't move him.
- I'm getting him off of this plane.

870
01:08:28,775 --> 01:08:32,779
You, you can't move him. He's
too far along. He could go into shock.

871
01:08:32,863 --> 01:08:35,157
She's right, Poe.
Go on, man.

872
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,618
I'm not leaving
without you, or you.

873
01:08:37,701 --> 01:08:40,662
Ah, listen. Here we go.
Ranger boy.

874
01:08:40,746 --> 01:08:44,041
- Right.
- Goddamn it, Poe!

875
01:08:44,124 --> 01:08:46,710
Man, it's time to fight,
fuck or hit the fence.

876
01:08:46,793 --> 01:08:49,254
- I suggest you hit the fence.
- He's right.

877
01:08:49,338 --> 01:08:51,715
Just go.

878
01:08:51,798 --> 01:08:55,177
All right. Here's how it's gonna play.
I'm gonna get you that needle.

879
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:57,971
Whatever you say, man.
Just do what you gotta do.

880
01:08:58,055 --> 01:08:59,640
Fuck.

881
01:08:59,723 --> 01:09:02,518
All right, you just hang on.
Don't die on me.

882
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:08,065
Swing low, sweet chariot

883
01:09:08,148 --> 01:09:11,151
Comin' for to carry me home

884
01:09:11,235 --> 01:09:14,988
Oh, no. What the hell
you think you're doin'?

885
01:09:15,030 --> 01:09:17,824
- lt's time to off the pigs.
- You can't do that.

886
01:09:17,866 --> 01:09:20,869
- Tell me why.
- They're hostages. We need 'em.

887
01:09:20,994 --> 01:09:25,749
- But why the fuck you care?
- Hey, man, come on.

888
01:09:25,832 --> 01:09:29,837
I can't think of a thing
I'd like better...

889
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:34,341
than to put a bullet in the brain base
of every one of these fuckers!

890
01:09:34,424 --> 01:09:38,387
But the fact of the matter is,
how well you know this Cindino?

891
01:09:38,512 --> 01:09:41,598
I mean, I don't know him that
well myself. Just what I read.

892
01:09:41,723 --> 01:09:45,143
Like how he firebombed that senator's yacht
with two of his own cousins on board.

893
01:09:45,185 --> 01:09:47,312
So what's your point?

894
01:09:47,396 --> 01:09:49,940
Why would he sweat about killing some hired
guns once they'd served his purpose?

895
01:09:50,023 --> 01:09:53,861
- Now think about that.
- What exactly are we discussing here?

896
01:09:53,944 --> 01:09:56,363
Poe don't want me
to off the pigs.

897
01:09:56,446 --> 01:10:00,200
Well, it's not difficult to surmise how
Nathan here feels about killing guards.

898
01:10:00,284 --> 01:10:02,870
And my own proclivities
are, uh...

899
01:10:02,953 --> 01:10:08,375
well-known and, uh,
often-lamented facts of penal lore.

900
01:10:08,417 --> 01:10:11,295
What I'm wonderin' is why you have
any opinion about it at all.

901
01:10:11,378 --> 01:10:14,214
Cyrus, this is your barbecue,
man, and it tastes good.

902
01:10:14,256 --> 01:10:18,635
But I was just sayin' to Mr. Dog over
here, that if it was my barbecue...

903
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:22,556
I'd wait for that old jumbo jet in the sky
before I start killin' our only leverage.

904
01:10:22,598 --> 01:10:25,392
- Shut the fuck up!
- Don't you want to get high and get laid?

905
01:10:25,434 --> 01:10:26,894
- Shit.
- Oh, fuck this!

906
01:10:26,977 --> 01:10:31,523
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down, Nathan.

907
01:10:31,607 --> 01:10:34,193
Poe's right.
We're goin' to Plan "B."

908
01:10:34,276 --> 01:10:37,112
Gonna get a refueling truck
and a tractor.

909
01:10:37,237 --> 01:10:39,615
So get back there
and dig the plane out.

910
01:10:56,924 --> 01:11:01,428
No. Yes!

911
01:11:17,194 --> 01:11:21,823
- Viking, 'bout time to go and get that tractor, yeah?
- Right.

912
01:11:23,534 --> 01:11:26,286
- I'll get the fuel truck.
- Thanks, Poe.

913
01:11:26,370 --> 01:11:29,122
You've proven to be
a most useful mammal.

914
01:11:29,206 --> 01:11:32,835
"Many hands make light work."
My daddy taught me that.

915
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,462
- You know what my daddy taught me?
- What's that?

916
01:11:35,546 --> 01:11:39,591
- Nothin'.
- Self-educated man.

917
01:11:42,135 --> 01:11:45,514
- Have you found Vince Larkin?
- We're having trouble reaching him, sir.

918
01:11:45,639 --> 01:11:48,350
Of course, you're having trouble
reaching him!

919
01:11:48,475 --> 01:11:53,063
He's off saving the rain forest
or recycling his sandals or some shit.

920
01:12:27,097 --> 01:12:29,516
Holy shit!

921
01:12:35,939 --> 01:12:39,359
Hey! We've got company!

922
01:12:39,401 --> 01:12:41,486
Hey!

923
01:12:41,570 --> 01:12:44,114
We've got company!

924
01:12:45,449 --> 01:12:48,285
Go get Cyrus.

925
01:12:48,368 --> 01:12:50,037
Yo, Cyrus!

926
01:12:57,044 --> 01:12:59,087
How long we got
till they get here, Nathan?

927
01:12:59,213 --> 01:13:03,050
Ten, twelve minutes, tops.

928
01:13:11,391 --> 01:13:14,853
Hey, what's your name?
Wanna play?

929
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:28,408
Nice jet.

930
01:13:28,492 --> 01:13:31,745
You can take Cindino and leave
the rest to rot for all I care.

931
01:13:31,787 --> 01:13:35,791
You fire that weapon, 20 pissed-off
prisoners are gonna hear it.

932
01:13:40,963 --> 01:13:44,675
Well, hooray for the sounds
of fuckin' silence.

933
01:13:44,758 --> 01:13:46,593
Freeze!

934
01:14:05,946 --> 01:14:08,073
- You're Cameron Poe.
- That's right.

935
01:14:08,156 --> 01:14:10,951
- I'm Larkin.
- Hello, Larkin.

936
01:14:10,993 --> 01:14:13,287
- I got your message.
- Where are the troops?

937
01:14:13,370 --> 01:14:16,123
- They'll be here.
- "They'll be here"?

938
01:14:16,206 --> 01:14:18,959
Uh-huh. In a minute.

939
01:14:19,042 --> 01:14:22,796
Listen, Poe, can I lower this?

940
01:14:22,838 --> 01:14:25,924
- Go ahead.
- You gonna lower yours?

941
01:14:26,008 --> 01:14:29,136
Sorry, boss, but there's only
two men I trust.

942
01:14:29,219 --> 01:14:31,638
One of them's me.
The other's not you.

943
01:14:33,807 --> 01:14:37,477
- So Cindino was running a drag on everyone.
- Yeah.

944
01:14:37,561 --> 01:14:40,230
If you can't trust a South American
drug lord, who can you trust, huh?

945
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:46,904
- That was a joke. - I'm glad you told me.
Now I gotta get back to the plane.

946
01:14:48,572 --> 01:14:51,533
You're a free man, Poe.
What are you doin'?

947
01:14:51,658 --> 01:14:54,995
I can't trade a friend's life
for my own, Larkin. That's all.

948
01:14:55,078 --> 01:14:57,831
You got a friend on board?

949
01:14:57,873 --> 01:15:01,835
See, I knew I was right
about you. I read your file.

950
01:15:01,877 --> 01:15:05,422
You're not such a bad guy. Just always
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

951
01:15:05,506 --> 01:15:07,674
Good-bye, Larkin.

952
01:15:09,676 --> 01:15:12,054
I spoke to your wife.

953
01:15:18,268 --> 01:15:20,812
- In person?
- In person.

954
01:15:21,855 --> 01:15:23,774
And your little girl.

955
01:15:25,901 --> 01:15:28,862
You saw Casey?

956
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:36,370
If this thing goes bad, Larkin,
I'm afraid my daughter...

957
01:15:36,411 --> 01:15:39,706
won't understand.

958
01:15:39,748 --> 01:15:44,044
If you talk to my wife again,
you tell her...

959
01:15:44,127 --> 01:15:46,046
I love her.

960
01:15:47,130 --> 01:15:50,050
She's my hummingbird.

961
01:15:50,133 --> 01:15:54,805
But I couldn't leave
a fallen man behind.

962
01:15:57,307 --> 01:16:00,394
You'll do that for me,
won't you, Larkin?

963
01:16:00,477 --> 01:16:04,648
Sure I will.
What are you gonna do for me?

964
01:16:04,731 --> 01:16:07,150
What do you think I'm gonna do?

965
01:16:07,234 --> 01:16:09,236
I'm gonna save the fuckin' day.

966
01:16:23,584 --> 01:16:27,296
Let's go, gentlemen.
The cavalry is on its way.

967
01:16:27,421 --> 01:16:32,342
- I want this airplane out now.
- Come on, men!

968
01:16:47,107 --> 01:16:50,944
- About another ten minutes.
- You said ten minutes ten minutes ago.

969
01:16:54,323 --> 01:16:56,617
Hello, Bob.
Wanna come over for dinner?

970
01:17:01,496 --> 01:17:04,499
Are you sick?

971
01:17:04,625 --> 01:17:08,086
- Why do you ask?
- You look sick.

972
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:13,342
- I am sick.
- You take medicine?

973
01:17:13,467 --> 01:17:15,594
There is no medicine
for what I have.

974
01:17:17,137 --> 01:17:19,932
- Wanna sing?
- Sing?

975
01:17:20,015 --> 01:17:22,643
Do you know "He's Got
the Whole World in His Hands"?

976
01:17:23,769 --> 01:17:25,354
Yes, I do.

977
01:17:25,437 --> 01:17:29,399
He's got the whole world
in His hands

978
01:17:29,483 --> 01:17:31,527
He's got the whole wide world

979
01:17:31,652 --> 01:17:33,612
Come on.

980
01:17:33,695 --> 01:17:38,992
He's got the whole world
in His hands

981
01:17:39,076 --> 01:17:43,372
He's got the whole wide world
in His hands

982
01:17:43,455 --> 01:17:47,960
He's got the whole world
in His hands

983
01:17:48,043 --> 01:17:51,964
He's got the whole world
in His hands

984
01:18:09,773 --> 01:18:12,693
lt's on the ground. Repeat.
The plane is on the ground.

985
01:18:12,776 --> 01:18:14,736
But it won't be for long.
Where the hell are ya?

986
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:16,905
We're westbound
near the Lerner cutoff.

987
01:18:48,103 --> 01:18:50,063
Where's Cindino?

988
01:18:53,275 --> 01:18:55,652
That's my fuckin' plane!

989
01:19:41,698 --> 01:19:43,617
Cyrus, help me.

990
01:19:47,454 --> 01:19:51,124
- Looks like you missed your connection.
- We were... We were coming to get you.

991
01:19:54,169 --> 01:19:56,129
Please.

992
01:19:56,213 --> 01:19:57,923
- Cy...
- ... Onara.

993
01:19:58,006 --> 01:20:00,425
No!

994
01:20:38,338 --> 01:20:42,634
- Don't kill me.
- I'm not gonna kill you, old-timer.

995
01:20:42,759 --> 01:20:45,179
Listen, I need a syringe.

996
01:20:45,262 --> 01:20:48,599
Oh, no!
Drugs'll end you, son.

997
01:20:48,682 --> 01:20:50,767
ls there a first aid kit
around here?

998
01:20:50,851 --> 01:20:53,520
Well, there might be one in the
fire truck over on the bone yard.

999
01:20:53,604 --> 01:20:58,066
All right, thanks. You just
stay here and don't panic.

1000
01:20:58,150 --> 01:21:01,278
That's easy for you to say.
You don't gotta take a piss.

1001
01:21:16,210 --> 01:21:18,754
- Let's get it on.
- Oh, yeah, that's nice. - Lock and load!

1002
01:21:23,175 --> 01:21:26,803
Considering my audience, I'm gonna
make this very quick, very simple.

1003
01:21:26,887 --> 01:21:30,682
This is the bone yard.
This is the hangar.

1004
01:21:30,807 --> 01:21:32,684
This is our plane.

1005
01:21:32,809 --> 01:21:36,563
- What's that?
- That's a rock.

1006
01:21:36,647 --> 01:21:38,440
Okay.

1007
01:21:38,524 --> 01:21:41,902
The convoy will enter
the bone yard through here.

1008
01:21:41,985 --> 01:21:45,405
Initially, we take out the first car.
Then we take out the last...

1009
01:21:45,489 --> 01:21:48,325
creating a trap,
an airtight cage...

1010
01:21:48,408 --> 01:21:51,787
filled with lots and lots
of dead people.

1011
01:21:51,870 --> 01:21:54,248
Nathan, set everybody
in their position, yeah?

1012
01:21:55,958 --> 01:21:58,460
Bring me those propane tanks.

1013
01:22:01,213 --> 01:22:04,341
Whoo, go girl.

1014
01:22:04,424 --> 01:22:07,553
Let's go, let's go. Get 'em in there.
If they give you any trouble, kill 'em.

1015
01:22:10,764 --> 01:22:12,599
What can I do?

1016
01:22:12,683 --> 01:22:15,894
Take this. Go into
the bone yard, yeah?

1017
01:22:16,019 --> 01:22:19,439
- Anybody gets through, you scratch their eyes out.
- You got it.

1018
01:23:11,658 --> 01:23:14,661
Come on, little piggy.

1019
01:23:32,221 --> 01:23:35,265
Closer. Closer. Closer.

1020
01:23:42,314 --> 01:23:45,734
Christ.
They'll be slaughtered.

1021
01:23:47,861 --> 01:23:50,364
This is Larkin.
Tell your men to fall back!

1022
01:23:50,447 --> 01:23:52,366
Now.

1023
01:24:23,438 --> 01:24:26,692
Come on, you stinking
piece-of-shit car!

1024
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:34,283
- What are you gonna do?
- What you doin', man?

1025
01:24:35,868 --> 01:24:38,036
Well, Baby-O...

1026
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:41,707
it's not exactly mai tais
and Yahtzee out here, but...

1027
01:24:43,250 --> 01:24:45,878
let's do it!

1028
01:24:56,722 --> 01:24:59,391
Gonna see what happens
now, bitch!

1029
01:24:59,516 --> 01:25:01,018
Bishop.

1030
01:25:13,155 --> 01:25:16,033
- Get the fuck off me!
- I'm gonna bust your ass!

1031
01:25:18,702 --> 01:25:21,705
Leave her alone, man!

1032
01:25:34,092 --> 01:25:36,261
Get behind the truck!

1033
01:25:36,386 --> 01:25:38,180
Get behind the truck!

1034
01:25:57,157 --> 01:26:02,287
- When you wake up, Bishop, I'll be Johnny 24.
- You wanna fight somebody?

1035
01:26:20,430 --> 01:26:24,852
Don't treat women like that!

1036
01:26:27,771 --> 01:26:29,314
Aw, shit!

1037
01:26:33,402 --> 01:26:34,820
Whoa! Whoa!

1038
01:26:36,864 --> 01:26:39,575
Get back to the plane!

1039
01:26:42,327 --> 01:26:43,829
Oh, my god!

1040
01:26:59,428 --> 01:27:00,888
Okay!

1041
01:27:02,556 --> 01:27:05,851
You might better
get yourself a seat now.

1042
01:27:10,731 --> 01:27:14,651
- Come on.
- Oh, shit! We're in.

1043
01:27:19,781 --> 01:27:22,034
Just take it and let's go.
Get ready to move.

1044
01:27:28,665 --> 01:27:31,126
We're tied up!

1045
01:27:47,976 --> 01:27:50,562
- Now, come on!
- Okay, I'm comin'.

1046
01:27:53,815 --> 01:27:57,152
- Go for the tires!
- Fuck the tires! I'm goin' for the pilot!

1047
01:28:09,498 --> 01:28:11,416
Isn't that your car, Malloy?

1048
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:14,753
Couldn't be.
I left mine at the office.

1049
01:28:18,006 --> 01:28:21,176
On any other day,
that might seem strange.

1050
01:28:33,188 --> 01:28:36,650
Gotta get her nose up!

1051
01:29:05,888 --> 01:29:08,557
Fuckers!
Come on!

1052
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:12,644
- When this is over, so are you, you little prick!
- Okay.

1053
01:29:20,611 --> 01:29:22,571
Bye-bye, Bob, bye-bye.

1054
01:29:30,913 --> 01:29:32,247
Go, girl!

1055
01:29:32,289 --> 01:29:34,666
Sweet home Alabama

1056
01:29:34,750 --> 01:29:37,294
All right!

1057
01:29:37,419 --> 01:29:39,880
Where the skies are so blue

1058
01:29:39,963 --> 01:29:42,424
Define irony.

1059
01:29:42,508 --> 01:29:44,676
Bunch of idiots
dancing on a plane...

1060
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:49,890
to a song made famous by a band
that died in a plane crash.

1061
01:29:57,147 --> 01:29:59,608
In Birmingham
they love the governor

1062
01:30:02,027 --> 01:30:04,863
We all did what we could do

1063
01:30:06,448 --> 01:30:11,912
Now Watergate
does not bother me

1064
01:30:11,995 --> 01:30:16,458
Does you conscience bother you
Tell me true

1065
01:30:16,542 --> 01:30:20,546
Sweet home Alabama

1066
01:30:22,714 --> 01:30:27,135
Someone alerted the authorities
at Carson City.

1067
01:30:27,219 --> 01:30:30,180
Someone told them
about our Lerner rendezvous.

1068
01:30:30,305 --> 01:30:33,350
Someone even killed
poor Billy Bedlam.

1069
01:30:33,475 --> 01:30:38,438
Now, could this all
be coincidence? Perhaps.

1070
01:30:38,522 --> 01:30:42,317
Then someone went
and tied a rope to our plane.

1071
01:30:42,401 --> 01:30:46,864
So I ask you, what is going on?

1072
01:30:46,989 --> 01:30:51,827
And I answer.
We have a traitor in our midst.

1073
01:30:51,910 --> 01:30:55,956
Now, how do we flush a traitor?

1074
01:30:56,039 --> 01:30:58,876
I don't know,
but at the count of three...

1075
01:30:59,001 --> 01:31:01,420
I will find out who is
on my team and who is not.

1076
01:31:01,503 --> 01:31:03,755
That would be one, two...

1077
01:31:03,839 --> 01:31:07,426
Wait! lt was me.

1078
01:31:07,509 --> 01:31:09,219
lt was me.

1079
01:31:09,344 --> 01:31:13,348
Don't listen to him, man.
T-T-The insulin made him crazy.

1080
01:31:13,432 --> 01:31:16,560
You have been near death
the entire trip?

1081
01:31:16,685 --> 01:31:19,730
- Yeah, motherfucker, it was me.
- No, he's, he's flipped out, man. He's nuts.

1082
01:31:19,855 --> 01:31:21,690
lt's pretty clever, huh, bitch?

1083
01:31:21,773 --> 01:31:25,569
- No! Jesus!
- No, that's clever!

1084
01:31:29,072 --> 01:31:32,910
"My daddy is coming home
on July 14th.

1085
01:31:33,035 --> 01:31:36,288
My birthday is July 14th.

1086
01:31:36,371 --> 01:31:39,666
I'm gonna see my daddy
for the first time ever...

1087
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:43,378
on July 14th.""

1088
01:31:43,462 --> 01:31:45,797
Make a move,
and the bunny gets it.

1089
01:31:51,970 --> 01:31:54,139
- Let's take him out, Larkin.
- Not yet!

1090
01:31:54,223 --> 01:31:55,807
Fire!

1091
01:31:55,891 --> 01:31:57,893
Goddamn it, Malloy!

1092
01:32:00,062 --> 01:32:02,439
- Cease fire!
- Get up here!

1093
01:32:05,609 --> 01:32:08,278
- What are we waiting for?
- That is my plane!

1094
01:32:08,403 --> 01:32:10,614
You got it, Agent Malloy?
You with me?

1095
01:32:10,739 --> 01:32:13,534
Or do you need me to draw it
in crayon, like usual?

1096
01:32:14,743 --> 01:32:17,538
I got a bad feeling, son.

1097
01:32:17,621 --> 01:32:21,583
- I'm feeling like maybe I'm not supposed to make it.
- You're gonna make it.

1098
01:32:23,669 --> 01:32:26,255
Cyrus Grissom, this is
Special Agent Vince Larkin.

1099
01:32:26,338 --> 01:32:30,759
We will shoot the plane down
if you do not respond now.

1100
01:32:32,594 --> 01:32:36,723
All I can think about is like,
there ain't no God.

1101
01:32:36,807 --> 01:32:39,601
That He don't exist.

1102
01:32:41,937 --> 01:32:46,984
- Hey, where you goin'?
- I'm gonna show you God does exist!

1103
01:32:52,322 --> 01:32:54,116
Fire!

1104
01:32:54,199 --> 01:32:57,411
Malloy, you son of a bitch!
Cease fire!

1105
01:32:58,328 --> 01:32:59,997
Yes!

1106
01:33:02,624 --> 01:33:04,668
Freeze, little bitch boy!

1107
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:18,182
- Switch to missile.
- Roger that, Two.

1108
01:33:18,307 --> 01:33:20,642
Arming missiles.

1109
01:33:20,726 --> 01:33:22,978
Malloy, don't you do it!
Get in his way.

1110
01:33:23,061 --> 01:33:24,521
Shit!

1111
01:33:26,148 --> 01:33:28,692
What the hell
are you doing, Larkin?

1112
01:33:28,817 --> 01:33:30,861
- I got no move, sir.
- Stupid bastard!

1113
01:33:42,497 --> 01:33:47,711
- No! Poe!
- Land this thing!

1114
01:33:47,836 --> 01:33:51,423
- Where the hell is the Virus?
- I'm the new captain. Put this thing down.

1115
01:33:51,507 --> 01:33:53,175
Target locked, sir.

1116
01:33:53,258 --> 01:33:56,178
- Oh, yeah!
- Don't you do it!

1117
01:33:56,220 --> 01:33:58,555
- Don't shoot!
- Don't fire.

1118
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:00,224
- Who is this?
- Identify yourself.

1119
01:34:00,349 --> 01:34:02,684
- This is Cameron Poe.
- Yes!

1120
01:34:02,726 --> 01:34:04,686
Poe!

1121
01:34:07,189 --> 01:34:09,650
Poe!

1122
01:34:09,733 --> 01:34:13,946
- I repeat, target is locked, sir.
- Malloy, he's got the plane!

1123
01:34:14,029 --> 01:34:18,784
We're not over civilian population.
Now is the time, sir.

1124
01:34:18,867 --> 01:34:21,912
- Don't fire.
- Malloy, listen to him! He's a friend!

1125
01:34:22,037 --> 01:34:24,873
He's just trying to get home
to see his wife and kid! Don't fire!

1126
01:34:24,957 --> 01:34:27,251
Now's the time, sir.

1127
01:34:29,086 --> 01:34:30,796
- Hold fire.
- Sir?

1128
01:34:30,879 --> 01:34:33,632
- I said hold fire!
- Thank you.

1129
01:34:37,553 --> 01:34:39,179
Poe!

1130
01:34:40,889 --> 01:34:42,266
Poe!

1131
01:34:42,391 --> 01:34:45,310
- Cyrus!
- What?

1132
01:34:51,316 --> 01:34:54,361
All right, Poe,
the Las Vegas Airport.

1133
01:34:54,444 --> 01:34:56,947
lt's just past the strip.
Can you see it?

1134
01:34:57,072 --> 01:34:59,408
Well, viva Las Vegas.

1135
01:34:59,491 --> 01:35:03,412
lt's right there, man. You can make it.
All the runways are cleared. Come on, do it, Poe.

1136
01:35:03,495 --> 01:35:05,289
Put this thing down.

1137
01:35:05,414 --> 01:35:09,126
Listen here, big daddy.
We got one engine shot to shit...

1138
01:35:09,251 --> 01:35:12,254
zero fuel,
and we're droppin' too fast.

1139
01:35:12,337 --> 01:35:17,009
The strip's where I'm gonna
land. Only the word is crash.

1140
01:35:18,802 --> 01:35:20,929
Should've shot 'em down
over the open desert, Larkin.

1141
01:35:21,013 --> 01:35:23,140
Now the civilian casualties
will be enormous.

1142
01:35:29,438 --> 01:35:34,026
Strap in, ladies. We're goin'
for a night out in Vegas.

1143
01:35:36,028 --> 01:35:40,032
He's got the whole world
in His hands

1144
01:35:40,115 --> 01:35:44,036
He's got the whole world
in His hands

1145
01:35:44,119 --> 01:35:48,165
- He's got the whole wide world in His hands
- Shut the fuck up, you freak! We're gonna die!

1146
01:35:50,792 --> 01:35:54,671
- Can he make it to the airport?
- No way, sir.

1147
01:35:57,841 --> 01:36:02,054
All right. We're gonna need police cars, uh,
fire engines, emergency service vehicles,

1148
01:36:02,137 --> 01:36:05,015
anybody who knows CPR.

1149
01:36:20,405 --> 01:36:22,366
Oh, this is beautiful!

1150
01:36:26,787 --> 01:36:28,747
Wake up, Cyrus!

1151
01:36:28,830 --> 01:36:30,791
In His hands

1152
01:36:36,964 --> 01:36:38,674
Little, bitty babies

1153
01:36:47,391 --> 01:36:48,976
Cyrus, wake up!

1154
01:36:54,690 --> 01:36:56,984
Stay with me.

1155
01:37:03,365 --> 01:37:07,703
Will the driver of the white corvette
please move your car or it will be towed.

1156
01:37:07,786 --> 01:37:10,455
We are shit outta road!
I'm outta here!

1157
01:37:24,303 --> 01:37:26,430
Before I kill you, Poe,
I just wanted you to know...

1158
01:37:26,513 --> 01:37:30,350
that the last thing that little
Casey Poe ever gets to smell...

1159
01:37:30,434 --> 01:37:33,520
will be my stinking breath.

1160
01:38:17,481 --> 01:38:19,399
Freeze!

1161
01:38:19,483 --> 01:38:22,778
Okay, lady,
hold it right there!

1162
01:38:56,520 --> 01:39:00,566
- How am I doin', son?
- You're doin' fine.

1163
01:39:13,161 --> 01:39:16,623
Check you out at the hospital,
son. You're gonna be fine.

1164
01:39:39,980 --> 01:39:43,567
- Yeah, this one's dead.
- We better get him outta here.

1165
01:39:47,738 --> 01:39:50,115
So what are you gonna do now?

1166
01:39:50,199 --> 01:39:54,119
I started this day with a birthday party
to get to, and I'm gonna get to it.

1167
01:40:02,211 --> 01:40:04,379
Thank you.

1168
01:40:04,463 --> 01:40:07,382
You take care, Sally Bishop.

1169
01:40:08,926 --> 01:40:10,969
Hey, Poe.

1170
01:40:11,053 --> 01:40:13,555
Next time, take the bus.

1171
01:40:20,604 --> 01:40:24,483
Come on, sweetie.
Go with Ginny and your mom.

1172
01:40:31,406 --> 01:40:33,659
- Cyrus.
- Grissom.

1173
01:40:58,684 --> 01:41:00,310
Move!

1174
01:41:33,719 --> 01:41:36,013
Come get it!
Come on now!

1175
01:41:36,096 --> 01:41:37,890
- That gun work?
- Yeah.

1176
01:41:37,973 --> 01:41:40,267
Well, shoot that piece of shit!

1177
01:42:12,049 --> 01:42:13,884
Jesus!

1178
01:43:07,855 --> 01:43:10,691
- What the hell is that?
- You pull over.

1179
01:43:10,774 --> 01:43:12,484
Yeah, sure.
How 'bout this?

1180
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:23,912
You ain't gettin' near
my daughter. Buckle up.

1181
01:45:10,727 --> 01:45:13,063
Just so's you know,
Marshal Larkin...

1182
01:45:13,146 --> 01:45:17,067
there's now three men I trust.

1183
01:45:17,150 --> 01:45:19,319
Am I one of 'em?

1184
01:45:28,912 --> 01:45:31,874
This is a weird thing to be
on a plane full of hard asses.

1185
01:45:33,375 --> 01:45:35,043
- You okay?
- No.

1186
01:45:35,169 --> 01:45:37,504
Good. I'm glad we didn't
shoot it down, huh?

1187
01:45:37,588 --> 01:45:40,048
Oh, yeah, worked out
much better this way.

1188
01:45:41,508 --> 01:45:43,886
Listen, I...

1189
01:45:44,011 --> 01:45:46,847
I wanna apologize
about the car.

1190
01:45:46,930 --> 01:45:49,057
I know a good body shop
in Fresno if it's insured.

1191
01:45:51,518 --> 01:45:54,104
- I was bored with that car anyway.
- lt worked out nicely then.

1192
01:46:04,615 --> 01:46:06,408
How do I

1193
01:46:08,076 --> 01:46:11,455
Get through one night
without you

1194
01:46:11,580 --> 01:46:16,084
If I had to live without you

1195
01:46:16,210 --> 01:46:19,755
What kind of life would that be

1196
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:23,425
Oh, now

1197
01:46:23,550 --> 01:46:27,095
I need you in my arms
Need you to hold me

1198
01:46:27,137 --> 01:46:30,432
- Hello, Cameron.
- You're my world, my heart, my soul

1199
01:46:30,557 --> 01:46:35,979
- Hello, hummingbird.
- If you ever leave

1200
01:46:36,104 --> 01:46:39,942
- Baby, you would take away everything
- I meant to get a haircut.

1201
01:46:39,983 --> 01:46:44,071
Good in my life

1202
01:46:44,154 --> 01:46:46,448
I got a present for ya, Casey.

1203
01:46:50,285 --> 01:46:52,329
Without you

1204
01:46:52,454 --> 01:46:54,915
A little dirty.

1205
01:46:54,998 --> 01:46:57,501
Casey, sweetie, you take
your daddy's present now.

1206
01:46:57,626 --> 01:46:59,837
No, no, no, honey.
lt's okay.

1207
01:47:02,005 --> 01:47:06,760
I got a picture,
a picture of you.

1208
01:47:08,011 --> 01:47:10,180
I got a picture of you, too.

1209
01:47:10,305 --> 01:47:13,517
Baby, I don't know
what I would do

1210
01:47:13,642 --> 01:47:16,937
I'd be lost if I lost you

1211
01:47:17,020 --> 01:47:21,692
If you ever leave

1212
01:47:21,817 --> 01:47:23,360
- Baby, you would take away
- Happy birthday, darlin'.

1213
01:47:23,485 --> 01:47:28,866
Everything real in my life

1214
01:47:30,450 --> 01:47:33,954
And tell me now

1215
01:47:34,037 --> 01:47:38,792
How do I live without you

1216
01:47:38,876 --> 01:47:41,712
I want to know

1217
01:47:41,837 --> 01:47:46,008
How do I breathe without you

1218
01:47:46,133 --> 01:47:49,344
If you ever go

1219
01:47:49,469 --> 01:47:52,306
How do I ever

1220
01:47:52,389 --> 01:47:57,019
Ever survive

1221
01:47:57,144 --> 01:48:00,063
New shooter comin' out, new shooter.
Does the new shooter feel lucky?

1222
01:48:00,147 --> 01:48:03,567
Well, does he?

1223
01:48:03,692 --> 01:48:06,862
Yes, yes he does.

1223
01:48:10,692 --> 01:48:15,862
