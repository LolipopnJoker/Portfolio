1
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,172
Fellas, it's go time.

2
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,616
Turtle Formation in three, two, one!

3
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,777
What happened to Turtle Formation?

4
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,213
Turtle Formation?

5
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,450
I thought you said "Squirrel Formation."

6
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,532
Why would he say "Squirrel..."
What's "Squirrel Formation"?

7
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,100
Guys, chill out. Let's go!

8
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,774
Hey, Raph, do that thing.

9
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,956
Oh, no. I don't want to do it. It hurts.

10
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,413
Do it, do it, do it...

11
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,140
Won't stop until you do it, do it, do it.

12
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,734
Okay, fine!

13
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,458
Whoo-whoo!

14
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,249
Yeah!

15
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,968
Yeah!

16
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,140
Whoo!

17
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,292
- Donnie!
- Here we go!

18
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,979
You set it up, right?

19
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,812
Yeah,
he'll be there, I promise.

20
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,580
Thanks, Kevin. See you next week!

21
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,533
Go, go, go!

22
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,490
Guys, you know the drill.
Let's get that box from Mikey.

23
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,620
Give me that.

24
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,376
- Over here! Whoa!
- Keep away!

25
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,179
Raph, over here!

26
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,368
Right back at you.

27
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,058
- I'll take that.
- Hey!

28
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,220
Whoo!

29
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,500
All right, guys.
We made it just in time!

30
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,218
You see that?

31
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,476
All right,
I say, "Go!" You say, "Knicks!"

32
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,252
- Go! Go!
- Knicks! Knicks!

33
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,516
Two points coming up!

34
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,900
Shoot it! Shoot the ball!

35
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,051
Oh, guys, does it get
any better than this?

36
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,176
Yeah, but I want to be down there.

37
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,773
You sit your ugly self down there,

38
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,356
you'd have people running for their lives.

39
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,336
You see me? I look good, brah.

40
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,018
Yo, fellas! Hey, hey, hey.

41
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,876
We got the best seats
in the house right here.

42
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,015
Anyone can sit down there.

43
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,374
We saved this city.

44
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,849
We should be on
the Jumbotron, not in it.

45
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,236
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

46
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,490
<i>one year ago,
a shadow fell over our city.</i>

47
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,979
<i>Suddenly, it was under siege
by the notorious villain, Shredder.</i>

48
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,412
<i>Along with his army of enforcers,
the Foot Clan,</i>

49
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,895
<i>Shredder ruled our streets.</i>

50
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,100
<i>Until one day,</i>

51
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,496
<i>from out of the shadows,
stepped a beacon of hope.</i>

52
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,571
Hey, you see who that is?

53
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,816
<i>He was just a humble cameraman.</i>

54
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,255
<i>But when danger struck
the heart of our city,</i>

55
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,458
<i>he single-handedly battled Shredder,
locking him up behind bars.</i>

56
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,132
<i>And now, turn your attention courtside</i>

57
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,018
<i>where Jill Martin meets
a man who, later this week,</i>

58
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,409
<i>will receive an honorary key to the city.</i>

59
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,579
<i>Please welcome
Vern "The Falcon" Fenwick!</i>

60
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,215
<i>Vern,</i>

61
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,656
<i>tell the fans how
a regular New Yorker like yourself</i>

62
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,537
<i>was able to single-handedly</i>

63
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,611
<i>hunt Shredder down
and bring him to justice.</i>

64
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,294
<i>Well, the truth is, Jill,</i>

65
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,854
<i>I actually had help
from a couple of friends.</i>

66
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,729
No way!
He's total ly gon na give us props.

67
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,299
Here it comes! Ooh, here it comes!

68
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,135
<i>Thunder and Lightning!</i>

69
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,255
<i>Yeah!</i>

70
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,299
- Aw, come on!
- What is this?

71
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,436
Guys, you know we couldn't take credit
for bringing down Shredder.

72
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,396
Vern's just sticking
to the arrangement we made with him.

73
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,569
Yeah, well,

74
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,636
this arrangement has
us spending the rest of our lives

75
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,854
sitting in the nosebleeds.

76
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,452
Speaking of nosebleeds...

77
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,580
- Hey, what'd you take?
- Hold on. Hold on.

78
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,316
Hey, be careful with that,
that's my peashooter.

79
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,100
Okay, hold on.
Head shot. Straight head shot.

80
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,249
Oh, you got this.

81
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,700
You got this! Yeah.

82
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,012
<i>So I just wanted to be
an example for all New Yorkers.</i>

83
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,729
<i>One man...</i>

84
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,934
Yo, you got him!

85
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,291
<i>Are you... Are you okay?</i>

86
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,209
<i>Yeah.</i>

87
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,356
Oh, my turn, my turn, my turn.

88
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,972
All right. All right. You got this.

89
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:46,097
<i>Okay. Thanks so much for joining us.</i>

90
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,738
<i>Vern "The Falcon" Fenwick, everybody!</i>

91
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,731
Take that, Falcon!

92
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,299
What happened out there?

93
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,929
Hey, April.

94
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,698
April! Hey! What's up, April?

95
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,356
Oh, nothing, I've been working out.

96
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,620
<i>Donnie, listen to me.
I'm at Grand Central Station</i>

97
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,571
staking out Dr. Baxter Stockman.

98
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,876
<i>Oh, Baxter Stockman!</i>

99
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,858
He graduated MIT at 15.
He's got 134 patents.

100
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,170
<i>He's the lead scientist for TCRI.</i>

101
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,057
<i>Big fan. The man's a genius.</i>

102
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,756
Yeah, well, he's a genius
that's about to be in a lot of trouble.

103
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,214
<i>Look, I think Baxter Stockman
is working with Shredder.</i>

104
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,137
Shredder. Do you need us there?

105
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,176
Nah. Baxter is a softie.

106
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,737
Oh, but, you know, that, uh,
birthday present that you made for me?

107
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,969
The watch, yeah.

108
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,335
I want to use it
to try and hack into Baxter's emails.

109
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,716
Okay, April, but if you're going to
hack into his accounts,

110
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,809
you'll need to get close.

111
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,969
<i>How close?</i>

112
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,335
Your watch needs to be
within three feet of his device,

113
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,819
iPad, iPhone, whatever.

114
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,697
Got it. Good looking out, buddy.

115
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,579
Talk to you soon.

116
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,213
Here you are, sir.

117
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,300
- Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

118
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,419
Excuse me.

119
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,929
Um, sorry. It's just... Aren't you...

120
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,756
As much as I'd like to be someone
that a girl like you would recognize,

121
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,135
I can assure you
you don't know who I am.

122
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,774
You're Baxter Stockman. PhD.

123
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,734
Graduated from MIT at 15 years old.

124
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,776
Your innovations in nanorobotics at TCRI

125
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,374
have been truly inspirational for me.

126
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,735
I'm so sorry. I'm just like... I'm a nerd!

127
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,856
No, please. Geek out. Please.

128
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,339
- Really?
- Yeah.

129
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,535
Oh.

130
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,053
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

131
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,916
Um, actually, though,
there's a big difference.

132
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,896
I'm a nerd, not a geek.

133
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,420
Um, it's the difference between, like,
<i>Lord of the Rings</i> and <i>Harry Potter.</i>

134
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,338
- Oh!
- Or, um, TED Talks and...

135
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,617
Comic-Con! Yeah.

136
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,379
- Wow.
- Yeah.

137
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,890
Dr. Stockman.
We just got confirmation, sir.

138
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,097
The "package" is shipping later tonight.

139
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,854
Well, make sure
they're tracking it every step of the way.

140
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,408
And Trevor, I'm done working for the day.

141
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,796
I just have to take this.
Really quick. It's my boyfriend. I'm sorry.

142
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,333
Oh, you have a boyfriend.

143
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,251
Of course you do.
But does your boyfriend know

144
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,774
the difference
between pi to the third decimal point,

145
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,010
and pi to the fifteenth decimal point?

146
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,852
It has truly been an honor to meet you.

147
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,659
And you are really one of the greatest
minds of our generation.

148
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,855
Bye.

149
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,413
Look, everybody. I got a cowboy.

150
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,178
Look at those muscles, am I right? Wow.

151
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,929
Cheese!

152
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,815
There's so many of you.

153
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,252
Defense! Defense! Defense!

154
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,054
Jump ball!

155
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:12,212
Jump ball! No way!
It's pizza on my Nike! It's pizza!

156
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,619
Look at it. Look at my shoe.

157
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,691
Explain that to me. It's pizza on my Nike!

158
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,299
Hey, man, welcome to New York.

159
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,813
That was a close call.

160
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,996
We're gonna
have to find a new spot

161
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,533
to watch the game now, Mikey.

162
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,175
Mikey!

163
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,098
Mikey, what are you doing?

164
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,738
It's the Halloween parade, bro.

165
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,288
I always wanted to be
in the Halloween parade.

166
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,735
It's the one night
of the year where we fit in.

167
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,889
Mikey, we'll never fit in.

168
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,733
We're ninjas.
We live in the shadows. Let's go!

169
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,337
Yeah. Let's go.

170
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,534
Cool.

171
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,540
Looking good, bro.

172
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,014
Whoa!

173
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,095
Thanks, man.

174
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,380
Mikey.

175
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,416
- Mikey.
- What's the problem?

176
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,616
This is my city. These are my people!

177
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:36,095
Is New York in the house?

178
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:37,980
Whoo!

179
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,932
That was the most amazing thing ever!

180
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,931
What part of
"ninjas move in the shadows"

181
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,976
don't you understand?

182
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,288
April! How'd it go?

183
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,380
Donnie, I'm looking at the data
from Baxter's iPad.

184
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,217
<i>Hey, you got in. What did you find?</i>

185
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,295
Hold on, Donnie. The files are erasing.

186
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,132
It's some sort of self-destruct program.

187
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,255
Erasing?

188
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,489
<i>Before they started erasing</i>

189
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,196
<i>I had a chance to read
a couple of Baxter's emails,</i>

190
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,335
<i>and I was right.</i>

191
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,537
Baxter is working with the Foot Clan.

192
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,249
Shredder is being transported to a prison
in upstate New York tonight.

193
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,460
And the Foot Clan
are planning on hitting the convoy.

194
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,330
They're gonna break him
out of police custody.

195
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,058
He'll be free again!

196
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,729
Who, Donnie?

197
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,419
Shredder.

198
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,009
Beebs.

199
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,255
Oh, okay.

200
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,779
Hey, Jones.

201
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,769
They're all yours.

202
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,691
What up, Big Daddy Law Breaker?

203
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:14,697
On behalf of the people of New York,
welcome to The Big Good-bye.

204
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,973
<i>You have meditated for nearly 24 hours.</i>

205
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,537
<i>In ten seconds you will reach nirvana</i>

206
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,612
<i>and total spiritual enlightenment.</i>

207
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,812
<i>Ten, nine...</i>

208
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,372
<i>- Three, two...</i>
- Hmm?

209
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,449
Excuse me. All right, slow down.

210
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,140
Does somebody want to explain?

211
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,933
Sensei, the Foot Clan are attempting

212
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,533
to break Shredder out of custody.

213
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,130
If Shredder is free,

214
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,178
his reign of terror
over the city will begin again.

215
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,380
Exactly.

216
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,456
Then there's only one question.

217
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,050
Why are you wasting time
talking to a grumpy old rat?

218
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,978
Go get him!

219
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,929
Thanks, Dad.

220
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,979
Okay, guys, don't get too excited.

221
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,539
It's still a work in progress.

222
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,578
Oh!

223
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,339
Dude!

224
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,249
Oh, whoa! Are you kidding me?

225
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,220
I'm telling you guys,
a lot of tweaking still required.

226
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,340
But when it's done,
it's gonna be amazing.

227
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,218
Well, no time like the present.

228
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,556
<i>All these wires
are still bunched up here.</i>

229
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,411
<i>There's no organization to any of this.</i>

230
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,456
<i>I've got red wires, yellow wires...</i>

231
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,540
As you can see,
the spot welding's not done yet...

232
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,396
- The seats don't recline...
- Donnie! Donnie!

233
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,455
Oh.

234
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,132
All right, Shredder's convoy
is 7.2 miles east-northeast.

235
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,255
Punch it!

236
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,540
They moved the timeline up.

237
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,852
Here we go.
Sensei Shredder's on the move.

238
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,339
Surveillance feed is live.

239
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,058
Standard transport formation.

240
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,140
These guys are so predictable.

241
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,454
Hey, Shredder!

242
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,574
You got 32 counts
of first-degree murder.

243
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,258
Hot damn!

244
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,770
You are one mean son of a bitch.

245
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,956
And take it from someone
who has his own problems

246
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,538
with anger management issues,

247
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,293
you, my friend, seriously need a hobby.

248
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,611
I myself am a hockey guy.

249
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,939
I like my bone crushing on ice.

250
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,373
You like hockey, right?

251
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,490
No. I like cage fighting.

252
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,133
Cage fighting. Okay.

253
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,575
It's him.

254
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,935
Hey, hey, hey, speak from your heart.

255
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,808
Hey, Mr. Shredder.

256
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:18,575
Big fan of your work.
Especially your early stuff.

257
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,091
My name is Bebop. This is Rocksteady.

258
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,613
I know it's a crazy name, right,

259
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,418
but his ancestors are from Finland.

260
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,650
Yeah, that's right. I'm Finnish.

261
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,578
Because when I start a beatdown,

262
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,013
I always "finish" it!

263
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,170
- What? Did you hear that?
- Yeah, I said it!

264
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,409
- I said it!
- My man!

265
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,853
- My man!
- Give me that foot.

266
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,254
Yeah!

267
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,091
Hey! Shut up back there.

268
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,414
World works in mysterious ways,
don't it, Shredder?

269
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,418
Now you get to spend
the rest of your life behind bars

270
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,853
with these two knuckleheads.

271
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,020
Or not.

272
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,858
Hey. Check those bikes.

273
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,820
Coming up on our right and our left.

274
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,613
Pin it! Pin it! Come on, man, go, go, go!

275
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,935
Oh, my God.

276
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,060
Whoa!

277
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,540
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

278
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,016
- Get us some help!
- 10-13. 10-13.

279
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,931
We are being ambushed,
heading north on 87.

280
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,169
We need immediate backup!

281
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,853
Make sure that gate is bolted.

282
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,174
Shotgun!

283
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,857
- Where are the shells?
- They're in the bag.

284
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,692
What the hell are they doing in the bag?

285
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,299
Oh! The roof is on fire!

286
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,980
Are you kidding me?

287
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,655
You send us on a highway

288
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,930
with the most dangerous criminal
on the planet,

289
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,453
and you don't load the shotgun!

290
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,211
We got bogies on the bus.

291
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,956
- Let's light 'em up.
- Okay. Hit the button.

292
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,255
What button? What button?
There are a million buttons.

293
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,380
- Number three. Number three.
- Three, three, three.

294
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,460
Oh!

295
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,020
We got company.
Mikey, clear our right flank.

296
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,655
Nunchuks giganticus. Whoa!

297
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,380
Say hello to my little friend.

298
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,492
Good job, Mikey.

299
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,730
Those things are pretty awesome, huh?

300
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,691
Yeah, pretty awesome!

301
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,009
Eh...

302
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,816
Get them out of there!
Eliminate those turtles!

303
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,780
Oh...

304
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,453
I don't like those guys.

305
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,060
I'm not being used
to my full potential here, Leo.

306
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,892
Hey, just chill, Raph. We're a little busy.

307
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,051
Uh, guys, they're coming back.

308
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,098
Enough! It's time to take out the trash.

309
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,939
That's how I roll.

310
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,019
That's how you roll.

311
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,100
Whoo!

312
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,578
Anything else I can do for you?

313
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,415
Raider 3, move in. Move in.
Get him to the extraction point.

314
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,940
Oh...

315
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,376
We are two miles from Exit 14.
Set up an intercept.

316
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,248
- What is that thing?
- It's a big-ass magnet.

317
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,140
Whoa!

318
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,580
Now we're talking!

319
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,618
Get back there. Secure the prisoners.

320
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,819
Shredder!

321
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,808
Shit!

322
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,811
- He's getting away!
- No, he's not.

323
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,209
Yeah!

324
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,916
If Sensei Shredder
can't make it to the extraction point,

325
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,090
then we bring the extraction point to him.

326
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,916
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Don't rush me! Don't rush me!

327
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,940
Yeah!

328
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,214
Hey. My name is Be-bop!

329
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,649
Hi.

330
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,177
Okay. It's all you, Mikey.

331
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,693
Time to shine.

332
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,540
Ow! Ow!

333
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,060
I'm sorry!

334
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,932
- It's stuck.
- Oh, this sucks.

335
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,219
- Oh, there it is.
- Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

336
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,617
This is awesome!

337
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,516
We have to teleport Shredder earlier.

338
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,655
But you said...

339
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,334
Yes, that that would be
irresponsibly dangerous. True.

340
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,380
All right, Donnie,
you've got to get Mikey closer.

341
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,053
Locking on.

342
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,529
One shot is all you got.

343
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,300
Initiate.

344
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,893
Take the shot, Mikey!

345
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,693
Where'd he go?

346
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,139
It worked!

347
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,889
But... Shredder's location unknown?

348
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,935
Where am I?

349
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,092
Does it matter?

350
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,375
I know what you're thinking right now.

351
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,452
Of all the ways you'd like to kill me.

352
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,293
But that would require
you outthinking me.

353
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:43,453
And no one, no thing
is smarter than the Krang!

354
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,059
Oh, I'm sorry.

355
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:50,133
Did I get a little tentacle mucus
in your eyes, Shredder?

356
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,180
So you know my name.

357
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,171
Why am I here?

358
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,535
Because you
and your buddy Dr. Stockman

359
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,009
found something of mine.

360
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,136
The teleportation device.

361
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,491
The teleport was
supposed to break me out of prison.

362
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,058
But it is capable
of so much more.

363
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,971
That device is part of a machine

364
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,937
called the arc capacitor.

365
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,891
Years ago, I launched
the arc capacitor to Earth's dimension.

366
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,210
But upon entering your atmosphere,

367
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,609
it broke apart into three pieces.

368
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,650
You and Stockman have one piece.

369
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,375
Another is in a museum in New York.

370
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,338
The third is in the Brazilian rainforest.

371
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,492
Collect the other two pieces.

372
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,491
Dr. Stockman should
be inventive enough

373
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:41,175
to reassemble the arc capacitor.

374
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,659
And then what?

375
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,059
It will open a portal

376
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,131
through which
I can bring my war machine,

377
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:49,018
the Technodrome, to Earth.

378
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:54,450
Together, we can bring
the people of your planet to their knees.

379
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,539
I'm interested.

380
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,460
I will help you take down planet Earth

381
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,054
if you help me with my problem.

382
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:06,057
Four brothers will try to stop me.

383
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,659
Turtles.

384
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,776
I'm aware of your past.

385
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,732
Take this.

386
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:16,972
It will solve
all your problems with those pests.

387
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,215
I'll see you on the other side.

388
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:27,257
Push me back in!

389
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,096
Push me in, you stupid robot.

390
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,219
More!

391
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,299
You idiot!

392
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,716
Okay, so he just vanished?

393
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,860
Wait, wait, wait.

394
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,540
If I run the video
from my shoulder camera

395
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,716
through an electrostatic filter,

396
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,413
we might be able to see
what happened to Shredder.

397
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,297
Come on. Show me something, buddy.

398
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,733
Look! Right there!

399
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:55,376
It appears to be some kind of
residue from a teleportation event.

400
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:58,976
Yeah, teleportation event residue, man.
It's the worst.

401
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,255
Does that kind of technology even exist?

402
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,900
Baxter Stockman's been
working on this kind of tech for years.

403
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,676
All of that stuff
that I pulled off of his iPad,

404
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,916
it was full of information
about Shredder and the Foot Clan.

405
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,180
It was like a virtual playbook!

406
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:13,095
Baxter has to have a backup.
And I bet it's on the mainframe at TCRI.

407
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,019
Donnie, I need something.
What do you got?

408
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,294
Wait.

409
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,180
I know exactly what you need.

410
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,248
Totally plug-and-play.

411
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,536
Perfect. I'll go check it out.

412
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,457
We'll go with. Operate in support.

413
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,299
Wait.

414
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,533
The sun's coming up.

415
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,693
You can't go outside. You'll be seen.

416
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,436
<i>The notorious
criminal known as Shredder</i>

417
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,900
<i>escaped police custody last night...</i>

418
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,476
<i>He was being
transported from Lower Manhattan</i>

419
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,916
<i>where he was serving a life sentence...</i>

420
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,636
<i>There's a
statewide manhunt in progress,</i>

421
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,716
<i>with the police chief saying</i>

422
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,856
<i>he will stop at nothing
to capture the fugitive.</i>

423
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,100
Unbelievable.

424
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:56,373
Widen the search radius to 200 miles
on all bridges and ports.

425
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:00,169
And I want hourly updates from
Homeland Security and Border Patrol.

426
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,137
Make it on the half hour.

427
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,415
Excuse me?

428
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,138
This is my investigation now.

429
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,256
Bureau Chief Vincent. Organized Crime.

430
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,898
I have jurisdictional authority.

431
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,618
You forfeited jurisdiction.

432
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,420
And you proved
to be an authority on nothing

433
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,930
when you lost
three convicted felons in one night!

434
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,693
Shredder's the most notorious criminal
this city has ever seen.

435
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,133
And we had him!

436
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,251
Now he's out there.

437
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,810
And where did you recover
this highly secured vehicle?

438
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:31,009
Found it under the G.W. Bridge,
abandoned and stripped.

439
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,449
Any witnesses?

440
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,252
Unfortunately.

441
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,036
Everything's normal,
I'm following procedure,

442
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:42,099
and the next thing I know,
ninjas on motorcycles just...

443
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,614
They come zipping past!

444
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,413
And they're coming at us
from every possible direction.

445
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,219
- Keep going.
- Okay. Uh...

446
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,895
I look at my side view

447
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,130
and I see what has to be
a giant garbage truck

448
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:55,337
that is just barreling towards
us like it is on a warpath.

449
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,836
And what was
the objective of this

450
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,498
battle-hungry sanitation vehicle?

451
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,916
See, I'm wondering
the same thing myself.

452
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,329
But then it starts
launching manhole covers

453
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,456
right from the grille of the truck.

454
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,009
Manhole covers!

455
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,893
Yeah, manhole covers.
As guided projectiles.

456
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,938
You're taking some time off, Jones.

457
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,698
I'm pulling you off the payroll.

458
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,771
Hey, I'm not crazy! I know what I saw!

459
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,420
Look, I can help you catch these guys.

460
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:21,020
I'm from New York.
I know these streets better than anyone.

461
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,977
First rule of tracking fugitives:

462
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,116
Don't take help from someone

463
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,796
who's responsible
for losing them in the first place.

464
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,333
We were ambushed!

465
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,659
Thanks for your statement, Jones.

466
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,889
That's Officer Jones!

467
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,136
And I'm gonna be a detective someday.

468
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,698
I'm just waiting for the next round

469
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,293
of applications at the academy.

470
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,693
Good luck with that.

471
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,449
As for now, do yourself a favor.

472
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,690
Leave this manhunt to the professionals.

473
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,854
So you two idiots have a favorite bar.

474
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,938
Yeah, they're not gonna be
stupid enough to go back there.

475
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,293
Yeah, they are.

476
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,098
Man, I really
rattled that prison guard's noggin good.

477
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,613
Did you see that head butt connect?

478
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,249
See it? I felt it,
I heard it, echoing off the walls!

479
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,536
- My man!
- My man!

480
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,655
Oh!

481
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,533
Just like Mama used to make.

482
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,571
Oi, barkeep! Where are those sammies?

483
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,971
Here you go, guys. House special.

484
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,180
- Mmm-hmm.
- It's about time.

485
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,796
And a side of pickles.

486
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,420
And are these
pickles untraceable?

487
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,059
Those phones are harder to track

488
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,493
than Shredder himself, homeboy.

489
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:10,814
Hey, do not make eye contact with us.

490
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,138
He think we somethin' to play with.

491
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,694
You know, Beebs,

492
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,175
I'm tired of being
someone else's errand boy.

493
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,572
With Shredder out of the picture,
maybe we could step up.

494
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,010
Carve out our own piece of the city.

495
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,613
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

496
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,140
Maybe even start our own Foot Clan.

497
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:33,340
Eventually work
our way up to our own Leg Clan!

498
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,934
I mean, honestly, how hard could it be?

499
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,169
Hey!

500
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,171
Mr. Shredder! My man.

501
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,293
Coincidentally, we were
just contemplating a consolidation

502
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,291
of our criminal enterprises.

503
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,371
We were thinking like a

504
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,292
51/49 split.

505
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,179
Leaning your way, of course.

506
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,818
He's not looking for partners.

507
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,771
I'm looking for errand boys.

508
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,371
Well, we could work with that.

509
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,097
Oh, wassup, drone?

510
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,733
I ain't scared of you.

511
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:16,209
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.

512
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,379
Every second we're down here,

513
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,213
Shredder gets more
powerful and Mikey gets more annoying.

514
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,580
Hey, I heard that!

515
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,695
We're training.

516
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,209
Sort of.

517
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,619
As soon as the sun goes down,
it's turtle time.

518
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,816
Hi, drone. You talkin' to me?

519
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,176
'Cause I don't see anybody else...

520
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,296
I failed, Master Splinter.

521
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:44,174
You put me in charge, and Shredder
slipped through our fingers.

522
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,089
There's nothing
you could have done to stop it.

523
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:51,093
Do not let this setback distract you.

524
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,299
Remember,

525
00:31:54,780 --> 00:32:01,015
as long as you keep the team unified,
you shall always succeed.

526
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,420
<i>We're asking anyone with information</i>

527
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,780
<i>about the fugitives' whereabouts,</i>

528
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,936
<i>to please pass it along to authorities...</i>

529
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,614
I just want to ask you one more ti me.

530
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,940
Are you sure those guys
didn't come through here?

531
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,693
Hey, pal, I don't know
what you're talking about.

532
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,615
Okay.

533
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,494
You know what? I love this song!

534
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,500
You don't mind if I borrow this, do you?

535
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,259
Hey, whoa... What are you doing?

536
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,898
Nah, you know what? Never mind.

537
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,015
It has a scratch on it.

538
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,100
Damn it!

539
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,260
Or maybe I'll have a drink.

540
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,177
- Are you out of your mind?
- Getting there.

541
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,455
Hey!

542
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,259
Stop it! Stop it! Just stop it, okay?

543
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,058
You ready to tell me where they are?

544
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,131
I slipped them cell phones.
That's all I know!

545
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,496
And I imagine a responsible
businessperson such as yourself,

546
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,298
wouldn't sell hardware without a means

547
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,972
by which to track said hardware.

548
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,812
- Am I right?
- Look! Here.

549
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:05,256
I have a GPS, okay?
You'll find them with that.

550
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,739
Where are you?

551
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,296
Where did it spit you out?

552
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,619
Sensei Shredder.

553
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,019
The escape plan, it worked!

554
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,533
But not in the way you planned.

555
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,173
I've traveled very far, and now...

556
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,771
We have work to do.

557
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,857
<i>Neustedder, come in.</i>

558
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,649
<i>Neustedder?</i>

559
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,412
<i>Neustedder, do you copy?</i>

560
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,893
When I found this thing,

561
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:23,892
I never could have
imagined its significance.

562
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,455
But this Commander Krang,

563
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,293
he said that this will help open
a portal to another dimension?

564
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,736
And when we do,
we'll join him in dominating this planet.

565
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,048
- We'll have ultimate power.
- Power.

566
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,493
And indescribable glory.

567
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:40,538
To be responsible for
opening the fabric between two worlds!

568
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,689
It's...

569
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,294
There are other pieces
required to open the portal.

570
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,773
If those four brothers are still out there,

571
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:51,172
we need to create soldiers
that can defeat them with a single blow.

572
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,216
And this will help us do that.

573
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,488
It needs to be synthesized.

574
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,651
Which is where you come in.

575
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,418
Ooh. Here come the brains.

576
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,298
Yo, Rock, check this out.

577
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,536
Beebs,
I got to get meself one of these.

578
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,576
Think of what we could do with this!

579
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,457
I feel like I'm back in science class.

580
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,859
Now all we need

581
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,128
are test subjects.

582
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,260
Whoa!

583
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:51,450
Candidates that will easily
fall under my command.

584
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,132
Large in size.

585
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,334
Low in intellect.

586
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,008
That stings!

587
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,499
And not in a good way.

588
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,772
What's going on?

589
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,891
What is happening to us?

590
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,659
I don't know, but this feels great!

591
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,572
Oh, this is gonna be good!

592
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,413
This feels funny.

593
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,371
Feels like I have ants in my pants.

594
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,779
Big ants!

595
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,619
All right, Bebop and Rocksteady...

596
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,971
I know you're up there somewhere.

597
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,699
I knew it!

598
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,330
Omnus, scan subjects.

599
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,099
<i>Searching.</i>

600
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,459
Miraculous.

601
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,451
Inside every human
there's a dormant gene

602
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,770
which ties us to our animal ancestors.

603
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,539
It's as if that purple ooze

604
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,656
has returned them to their rightful place

605
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,889
in the animal kingdom.

606
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,015
Whoa, Rock!

607
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,019
You're a rhinoceros.

608
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,739
And you're a...

609
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,572
I don't know what you are.

610
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,211
All right, let me look, let me look.
I'm a...

611
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,895
Huh. I'm a little piggy.

612
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,448
You're a warthog.

613
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,060
- Hey, Beebs!
- Yeah, Rock.

614
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,608
Ever see a rhino charge?

615
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,094
That hurts.

616
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,898
- I like it!
- Me, too!

617
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,409
Me, too.

618
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,330
Prepare the entire container.

619
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:20,898
The more of them we create,
the easier it will be to secure the portal.

620
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,773
My man!

621
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,980
This is awesome!

622
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,653
Check out the horn!

623
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,815
Yeah, baby!

624
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,539
Hey, man, check out
my tail. Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.

625
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,900
That is cool. Do I have one?

626
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,089
Hey, Rock, who is that?

627
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,660
O'Neil.

628
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,939
Get that canister!

629
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,495
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

630
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,054
You guys don't really want
to do this again, right?

631
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,093
It doesn't usually
work out well for you guys.

632
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,893
Because I have the four friends.

633
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,576
They're green ninjas.

634
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,059
Give us the ooze.

635
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,620
Hi.

636
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,659
Where'd it go?

637
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,299
- Stop!
- Freeze!

638
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:21,010
See, that guy
with the hockey stick in the other alley,

639
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,499
I have nothing to do with that.

640
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:28,660
Whoo!

641
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,459
Thank you.

642
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,655
- What's your name?
- Casey Jones.

643
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,851
- What's that?
- Casey Jones.

644
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,329
Stacy Moans?

645
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,460
Oh, uh...

646
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,689
Casey Jones.

647
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:47,969
Hi.

648
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,858
- Get away from her!
- Hey! Whoa!

649
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,215
Get back.

650
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,735
Do not eat us.

651
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,609
We are not food.

652
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:07,255
The people of Earth
are not your enemies.

653
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,859
Yeah? Yeah.

654
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:11,700
Watch this.

655
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,972
We were sent by the Supreme Leader

656
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,528
to eat delicious humans

657
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:22,375
and dip them in ranch dressing.

658
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,569
I'm just kidding.

659
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:29,093
I'm a vegan.
Except for meat and cheese and eggs.

660
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,055
Casey, they're my friends.

661
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,495
Oh. Oh, they...

662
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,899
They're your friends.

663
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,568
Yeah, they're my friends.

664
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,809
- Tell him.
- Yeah.

665
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,539
Donatello over there in the purple,
he's a technical genius,

666
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,929
who is technically a genius!

667
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:49,574
Raphael over there in the red,
he's like a big cuddly teddy bear,

668
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,570
if big cuddly teddy bears
were incredibly violent.

669
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:55,299
This is Leonardo.
He's in the blue. Fearless leader.

670
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,853
Silent but deadly.

671
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,730
And I'm Michelangelo,
sporting my signature orange.

672
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,856
I'm a triple threat... Brains, brawn,

673
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,931
and obviously a dazzling personality.

674
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,156
Ladies like to call me Mikey.

675
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,215
Are you done?

676
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,335
Yeah.

677
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,276
Sorry we're late, April.

678
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:12,053
You want to walk me through
what's going on here?

679
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:15,496
Uh, okay, um, so I went to go see Baxter,
but then Shredder was there.

680
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:18,219
And then he was talking
about opening up some sort of portal

681
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:20,615
to another dimension, and then he...

682
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:21,700
He took this purple ooze

683
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:24,852
and he injected it into those
two criminals that escaped with him.

684
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:27,010
And then he turned
one of them into a rhinoceros

685
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,619
and the other one into a warthog.

686
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,256
You have eyes on
Bebop and Rocksteady?

687
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:33,978
Why do you care about those two?

688
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:35,636
Let's just say that
I have a vested interest

689
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:37,093
in bringing them to justice.

690
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:38,329
Let's get back to the lair.

691
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:41,571
Raph, grab
<i>Friday the 13th</i> here and follow.

692
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:44,734
If he can help us find Bebop
and Rocksteady, he's coming with.

693
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:48,574
No, he's not. Not a chance.
I'm staying right here.

694
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:51,015
I'd agree with you, but you're wrong.

695
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,739
See, we, too, share a "vested interest."

696
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:55,731
I don't share anything with you guys.

697
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:56,889
Fellas, fellas...

698
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,460
Now, the people of New York

699
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,173
need us to set aside our differences
and work together.

700
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:04,129
Which begs only one question.

701
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:07,610
Are you two guys like a thing or...

702
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:09,980
Come on, move it!

703
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,356
If this purple
ooze was injected into

704
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:18,938
Bebop and Rocksteady's bloodstream,

705
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:22,330
it's feasible that were I to pinpoint
a singular isotopic signature,

706
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:24,695
I may be able to use it
to track their location.

707
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:28,170
And if we find them,
then we find Shredder.

708
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:29,852
Put them all in shackles!

709
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:32,295
And as long as
we all have our hockey masks,

710
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:34,018
what could go wrong?

711
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:37,096
Seriously?
Now I'm taking wardrobe advice

712
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,932
from a bunch of Swamp Things...

713
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:41,454
Hey! Living in
an underground amusement park,

714
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:44,612
and have, forgive me,
the most pretentious names ever.

715
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,930
Uh, excuse me, I named them.

716
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,008
Hey, guys?

717
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:52,052
Nobody move. Don't move!

718
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:57,697
There is a giant rat back there.

719
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,336
- Yeah, we've, uh...
- Mmm-hmm.

720
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:06,217
Seen him around here before.

721
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,370
You know, there's only
one way to get rid of him.

722
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:10,654
You got to get low.

723
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:11,809
Low! Yeah.

724
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:14,659
When you go at him, you got to go fast,
and you got to go hard.

725
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:18,055
We believe in you, Casey Jones.
It's all you, bro.

726
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:19,716
Exactly.
We need you to get him.

727
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,219
Three, two, one, go!

728
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:31,736
Giant rat, 1. New guy, 0.

729
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:37,051
I can't
believe it was that easy.

730
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:39,608
I almost thought he wasn't
gonna do it for a second.

731
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,577
Good stuff. Good stuff.

732
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:44,328
We should really
have people over more often.

733
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:45,975
You're leaving?

734
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:47,857
If I can find my way out of here, I am.

735
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,738
You know, I was doing
just fine tracking Bebop and Rocksteady,

736
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,811
and then you just T-boned my existence.

737
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,140
So now I'm gonna find them
or I'm gonna go down swinging.

738
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:56,956
- Casey...
- No, it's like they say,

739
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:59,733
"If you want to get work done,
don't spend time at the zoo."

740
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:05,778
"Tartaruga Brothers"?

741
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:09,099
That's the...

742
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:11,099
That's the truck.

743
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,133
It was them.

744
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:17,449
Who are these guys?

745
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:23,055
These four have done more for this city
than you will ever know

746
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:25,131
or they will ever take credit for.

747
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:28,539
So if you want to go down swinging,

748
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:30,815
these guys hit harder than anyone.

749
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:41,653
All right, Donnie, you got this.

750
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,374
Okay.

751
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:48,939
Dissolve the quadra-helix bonds
and reverse the cohesion.

752
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,335
Wait.

753
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,819
That would mean...

754
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:57,657
Is it really possible?

755
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,617
We have confirmation, Master Shredder.

756
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:08,419
The canister of purple ooze
is at police headquarters.

757
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,139
Take a team. Recover it at all costs.

758
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:14,417
I'll retrieve the first piece needed
to open the portal.

759
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,694
How many men do you want?

760
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:18,248
This job is too important for just men.

761
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:20,570
I'm bringing with me the next generation

762
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:22,810
of finely tuned combat soldiers.

763
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:32,130
Hey, uh, I've been meaning
to ask you this, Rock.

764
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:33,739
Do I look fat to you?

765
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:36,853
Fat? Oh, no, buddy, no.

766
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:38,579
You look

767
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,175
really fat!

768
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:44,332
The belly must be jelly,
'cause jam don't shake like that.

769
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:45,819
- My man!
- My man!

770
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:00,740
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

771
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:03,130
Leo. Leo! Leo!

772
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:05,094
Leo!

773
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:08,175
Leo! Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh. This is amazing!

774
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,899
Leo, Leo, okay.
You're not gonna believe this.

775
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,529
Okay, I made a solution
from a sample of the purple ooze,

776
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:15,656
right, to expedite analysis of the isotope?

777
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:18,891
But while I was waiting for it
to catalyze, I started thinking,

778
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:22,177
if the purple ooze can
turn humans into animals,

779
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:25,173
perhaps if properly reengineered...

780
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:26,568
Watch this. Watch this.

781
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:30,252
It could turn us

782
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,852
into humans.

783
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:47,774
If we could get
our hands on more of this stuff,

784
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:49,737
it could be life changing!

785
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:54,292
We don't need that kind of change.

786
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:00,259
Okay. You're right.

787
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:02,460
To blend in with humans

788
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,139
could compromise
our strategic advantage.

789
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,691
We have a system that works.

790
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:10,451
We shouldn't mess with the formula.

791
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:13,060
And Donnie.

792
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:18,653
Listen.

793
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:21,095
You can't say a word
of this to the others.

794
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,456
Wow. Look at this place.

795
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:55,452
And to think, the entire universe,

796
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:58,134
it all started with the Big Bang.

797
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:00,859
Yeah, Beebs?
Well, I got a "Big Bang" for you.

798
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:05,893
Oh, man! That is awful!
That is the worst!

799
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:07,936
- Smash it.
- That's what we do!

800
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,980
- Ow!
- That rock is hard.

801
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:20,052
- Can't feel my legs.
- Twisted my melon, man.

802
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:53,568
Only one piece left to recover.

803
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:56,975
Get ready to take a trip, boys.

804
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,011
You're going to Brazil.

805
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,568
Oh, my Speedo's already packed!

806
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:07,396
I didn't believe it,

807
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:09,536
but then Donnie showed him
it could really work.

808
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:11,975
It was the coolest thing I've ever seen.

809
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,450
It gave me hope.

810
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:17,460
Maybe we don't have to be
stuck down here forever, you know.

811
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:20,618
So Leo told Donnie to keep it a secret.

812
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:22,859
From us?

813
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:26,615
- Uh... No. Hold on.
- Who does he think he is?

814
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:30,370
No, wait.
Hey, look, if you tell Leo

815
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,297
that I told you that Donnie told him...

816
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:36,414
We'll never finish
our hip-hop Christmas album!

817
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:42,133
Pop quiz.

818
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:44,854
What are the three most
important traits of the ninja?

819
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,574
Speed.

820
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,177
Stealth.

821
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,054
And honor.

822
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:58,617
Where's the honor
in keeping secrets from your brothers?

823
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,460
I don't know what you're talking about.

824
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:05,210
So now you're adding lying to the list.

825
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:08,212
If you're referring to what Donnie
told me about the purple ooze,

826
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:11,815
it's called
"compartmentalization of information."

827
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:16,772
If there's even a chance
that ooze can make us human...

828
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:19,658
We're turtles, whether you like it or not.

829
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:21,059
It's not about what I like,

830
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:23,779
it's about what people up there
are willing to accept.

831
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:26,294
True acceptance only comes from within.

832
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:28,496
Don't give me that fortune cookie muck!

833
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:31,652
You should consult with us before you
decide to do something like that!

834
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:33,970
I consulted Donnie. And we decided...

835
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:35,971
And what about Mikey?
He don't get a vote?

836
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:38,130
There's only one vote
that counts in this family!

837
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:39,494
Mine!

838
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:42,455
Leo.

839
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:45,929
Leo, an alarm just tripped
at the Hayden Planetarium.

840
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:47,453
We have to get uptown.

841
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,212
Gear up, Donnie.

842
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:52,299
You two stay here.

843
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:55,454
You're benching me?

844
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,610
- Call it what you want.
- What'd I do?

845
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:58,849
Sorry, guys.

846
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:02,014
Well, that went well.

847
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:05,456
The nerve this guy has. Big timing us!

848
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:07,459
He may be fine with the status quo,

849
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:08,956
but that don't mean we can't
make our own decisions.

850
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:10,857
Yeah!

851
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:13,135
Wait. Wait. What are you saying?

852
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:16,417
It means there's more
where that purple ooze came from.

853
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:18,656
And we're gonna get our hands on it.

854
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:20,378
Yeah!

855
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,897
I still don't know what you're saying.

856
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:26,052
Are we... Are we doing something?

857
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:30,416
Wow. The American Museum
of Natural History.

858
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,297
I've always wanted to come here.

859
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:34,299
Quit screwing around, Donnie.

860
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:36,140
Thirty seconds
till the cops are at the door.

861
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:41,900
- Donnie...
- Whoa.

862
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:44,940
Boo-yah.

863
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:47,890
Shredder and the mutants
were definitely here.

864
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:51,899
And I'm detecting traces of neutronium,

865
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:56,254
the critical ingredient required
for creating a controlled black hole.

866
00:53:57,060 --> 00:54:02,578
Which is the only thing capable of
rupturing the space-time continuum.

867
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:05,778
And you know what that means!

868
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:09,293
No. I don't, Donnie.

869
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:12,292
It means Shredder may not be
as nuts as I thought.

870
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:13,699
From the data I just collected,

871
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:16,772
I'm surmising that
what was inside this thing

872
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:20,172
may help Shredder
open that portal to another dimension.

873
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,694
Okay, what I want to know is,

874
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:25,852
if a portal's gonna open up,

875
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:28,773
what's coming through
from the other side?

876
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:35,618
So you want to break
into police headquarters.

877
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:36,929
Uh... Yeah.

878
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:38,780
Donnie said he needs
more of the purple ooze

879
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:40,771
to track Bebop and Rocksteady.

880
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:43,932
And you said the cops would've logged it
into Evidence Control Room by now.

881
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:46,580
Okay, and Leo is good with this plan?

882
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,138
Actually, I'm in charge on this one.

883
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:53,374
- Ain't that right, Mikey?
- You're right.

884
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:56,340
Look.

885
00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:00,132
So, we can take
the elevator shafts and vents.

886
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,252
We need you two to stay on the ground.

887
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,580
Whoa. I...

888
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,890
I can't just walk
right into police headquarters.

889
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:08,171
- What are you, chicken?
- Hey!

890
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:11,339
Who are you calling chicken, turtle?

891
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,933
Look, do you want to find
Bebop and Rocksteady or not?

892
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:20,820
So we're breaking
into police headquarters.

893
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,578
We got one last boondoggle.

894
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:30,129
We need to find someone to sneak
you guys past security checkpoint.

895
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,059
Only plan I got so far

896
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:34,850
may be a tad less than appetizing.

897
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:39,379
Are we going somewhere?

898
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:41,916
I'm gonna take a photo
with all of you, don't worry,

899
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:43,373
everybody's gonna get one tonight.

900
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:44,933
- Hey, Vern.
- Yeah?

901
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:46,419
Big fan. Big fan.

902
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,094
My gosh, Carmelo Anthony,
right back at ya!

903
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:50,249
Nice key to the city.

904
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:52,276
Oh, thank you.
Yeah, I mean, they give these things out.

905
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:53,676
Hey, Melo...
Do you mind if I call you Melo?

906
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:54,735
Not at all.

907
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:56,900
Listen, I'm really glad
that you stopped me, because,

908
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:59,156
guys like you and me,
we're kind of the same.

909
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:00,329
Right.

910
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:02,980
We bring a lot of
joy and hope into people's lives.

911
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,618
We got that kind of star power.

912
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:07,294
And while it's a gift,
this bond that we have...

913
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:08,608
- There you are.
- Hey.

914
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:11,619
Melo, I'd like to introduce you
to my girlfriend, Alessandra.

915
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,036
Girlfriend? We just met a week ago.

916
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:14,095
Nice to meet you.

917
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:16,489
Now we're all over each other. Stop it!

918
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:19,814
- You know, um, um...
- Vern!

919
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:21,940
You know, what might be
a great idea is if we, uh...

920
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:23,055
Vern!

921
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:25,293
- I don't know...
- We need to go.

922
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:27,888
And, uh, bring that
key to the city with you.

923
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:32,539
- I think you need to go.
- Yep.

924
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:34,489
Unbelievable, you know?

925
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:37,014
I mean, your jealousy knows no limits.

926
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,257
- We need your help.
- We? Who's "we"?

927
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:45,297
Well, well, well,
if it ain't the prince of the city.

928
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:47,211
You know what? Give me a break, Raph.

929
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,956
You're the one who told me to take credit
for Shredder in the first place.

930
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:52,494
And now in light of the fact
that he is who knows where,

931
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:54,836
I am starting to have profound regrets
about our arrangement.

932
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:57,772
So, are we just gonna
stand around and talk or...

933
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:01,096
- Who's this guy?
- Total loser, bro.

934
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,291
I mean, nice enough fella,

935
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:05,291
if you like guys
who can't even bench press.

936
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:07,175
Boom!

937
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:08,534
Or fill out a T-shirt.

938
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:11,651
Vern, he's a part of the plan.

939
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:13,340
What plan is that?

940
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:17,177
The plan to break
into police headquarters.

941
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:20,650
- What?
- We need to find Shredder.

942
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:23,534
"We"? No, no, no. No, we're not doing...

943
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:25,895
Listen, I'd love to help
you guys out, but I can't.

944
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:28,488
- I got concert tickets to a lunch.
- Sweet key.

945
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:31,333
- Does it go to something?
- No, it's just the city.

946
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:34,612
Vern, as the resident new guy
in this band of freaky misfits,

947
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:38,650
do yourself a favor, and just roll with it.

948
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:41,650
Hey, new guy, all I do is roll with it.

949
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:43,459
I've been rolling with it

950
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:46,094
since you were wearing baby T-shirts
because you were a baby.

951
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:48,171
Police headquarters. Thirty minutes.

952
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:50,453
See you there.

953
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:54,734
- See you there.
- He just said that.

954
00:57:58,660 --> 00:57:59,729
Hey, guys.

955
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:01,890
Look who it is.
Vern "The Falcon" Fenwick!

956
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:18,220
Let's take a picture, huh? Come on.

957
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:27,138
Yeah, I'll just take one
and send it to all you guys. Just gotta...

958
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:36,018
...do, like, a panorama thing there...

959
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:37,369
You guys look good.

960
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:46,300
- Any time now, Mikey.
- I'm hurrying, I'm hurrying.

961
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:49,540
Yes!

962
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:51,218
All right, smile. Smile for your...

963
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,500
The meeting's in 10 minutes.

964
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:15,220
I need to see...

965
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:34,579
Cowabunga.

966
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:53,168
Oh, hey, Mikey. What's up?

967
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:55,455
<i>- Mayday, mayday, mayday!</i>
- What's going on?

968
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:56,916
The Foot Clan have the purple ooze!

969
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:58,820
We need backup
at police headquarters right now!

970
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:00,276
Hang tight, Mikey. We'll be right there.

971
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:01,449
We're on the move.

972
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:05,973
We have to get above the exit!

973
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,770
What, are you crazy? We can't be seen!

974
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:28,135
That purple ooze
is our only shot at being normal,

975
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:29,780
and it's heading toward the front door.

976
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:34,294
Freeze!

977
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:42,498
You with me or not?

978
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:44,649
Let's go!

979
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:02,676
Raph, what are you doing with that?

980
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,300
Freeze!

981
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:06,577
- Don't move! Don't move!
- No, no, no.

982
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:08,476
Show me your hands!

983
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,650
- Hold it!
- Freeze right there!

984
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:11,996
Don't move! We will shoot!

985
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:13,916
- Get down on the ground.
- Wait! We're the good guys!

986
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:16,215
- Get on the ground!
- All right, okay.

987
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:20,178
What are those things?

988
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:22,373
They're monsters.

989
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:25,331
They're monsters!

990
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:27,213
We're not monsters.

991
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:30,451
No! No! No! Don't shoot!

992
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:32,460
- Stop it! No, don't!
- Don't shoot, don't shoot.

993
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:33,935
Go.

994
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,413
Go now!

995
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:47,376
Get to the ground slowly. Get down!

996
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:49,932
Jones, you've got to be kidding me.

997
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:54,209
Put these two in holding.

998
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:58,255
Jade, what we just saw
stays in the department.

999
01:01:58,340 --> 01:01:59,932
The public doesn't need to know.

1000
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:04,609
It is all over the police scanner,
they are hunting you.

1001
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:06,380
- What happened up there?
- Tell him, Raph.

1002
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:08,316
Tell him how you broke rank
and got us all exposed.

1003
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:09,436
For the most selfish reason.

1004
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:10,916
The Foot were gonna
get their hands on it.

1005
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:12,055
You didn't know that!

1006
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:13,516
Stealing from police headquarters...

1007
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:14,956
There's no scenario
where you wouldn't get caught.

1008
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:16,636
Maybe if you hadn't lied
to your own flesh and blood...

1009
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:18,298
Oh, wait. The way you lied to April?

1010
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:20,336
And now she's taking
the fall for your mess.

1011
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:26,221
You should've
seen the looks on their faces.

1012
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:29,410
They weren't just scared.

1013
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:30,933
There was

1014
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:33,779
actual hate.

1015
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:38,177
It will be all right, my son.

1016
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:40,455
People fear what they do not understand.

1017
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:46,770
You can't walk away from this.

1018
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:49,259
I told him, Master Splinter.

1019
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:51,854
But Raph, he never hears
a word I have to say.

1020
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:54,276
Now, I knew they couldn't
handle the truth about the purple ooze,

1021
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:55,860
and you know what,
they proved me right.

1022
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:57,420
- Leonardo.
- I don't know what to do!

1023
01:02:57,460 --> 01:02:59,052
Donnie's nose is in his computer,

1024
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:00,539
Raph's brains are in his biceps,

1025
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:02,292
and Mikey's head's in the clouds!

1026
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:04,098
I can't get them all on the same page.

1027
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:05,499
To think with one mind.

1028
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:08,697
You shouldn't want them all
to think the same.

1029
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:11,380
It's their different points of view
that make the team strong.

1030
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:14,854
A good leader understands this.

1031
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:17,818
A good brother accepts it.

1032
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:22,130
Guys? I got something!

1033
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:23,956
Talk to me, Donnie.

1034
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:26,699
The computer's pinpointed
the isotopic signature of the purple ooze.

1035
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:30,132
I can track Bebop and Rocksteady's
exact coordinates.

1036
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:32,531
I got 'em.

1037
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:34,855
They're at 36,000 feet,
traveling at 490 knots.

1038
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:37,619
Whoa. They've achieved
the power of flight!

1039
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:39,133
Good for them, you know.

1040
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:41,372
They're on a plane, Mikey.

1041
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:42,460
Oh.

1042
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:46,092
It looks like our mutant buddies
are headed to Brazil.

1043
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:47,316
How do we get there?

1044
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:49,774
We sneak
onto the next cargo plane from JFK.

1045
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:52,331
They're not monsters, okay?

1046
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:54,220
The only real monster
in this city is Shredder

1047
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:55,820
and the two mutants that he's created.

1048
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:57,293
Bebop and Rocksteady.

1049
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:58,836
If you think anything
coming out of your mouth

1050
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:01,579
is gonna add to her credibility,
you are sorely mistaken.

1051
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:04,174
Shredder mutated them
with the help of Baxter Stockman.

1052
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:05,796
That's actually who you need to go see.

1053
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:07,936
Funny you should mention Dr. Stockman

1054
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:09,851
because we just finished analyzing

1055
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:12,738
some security footage
from TCRI that he gave us.

1056
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:14,811
- Great.
- Guess who's on it.

1057
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:22,452
That's not what happened.

1058
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:24,420
That footage has been altered.
It's been edited.

1059
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:26,371
We checked its authenticity.

1060
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:27,529
It's clean.

1061
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:29,740
I want a phone call.

1062
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:32,716
I hate to break it to you,
but all the phones have been shut down

1063
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:34,860
on account of monsters
breaking into our stationhouse.

1064
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:36,578
Well, I hate to break it to you,

1065
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:38,497
but legally I'm entitled to a phone call.

1066
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:42,260
- Tell me where they are.
- I don't know.

1067
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:45,131
But if I did, I wouldn't tell you.

1068
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:47,219
Chief,

1069
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:50,693
the turtles are not the ones
you should be chasing.

1070
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:22,975
Ha-ha! We found it!

1071
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:41,493
Lookee here.

1072
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:46,050
I like it.

1073
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:48,596
<i>Boss, boss, we did it! We did it!</i>

1074
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:51,578
<i>We got that super-important-thingy-
kind-of-hard-thing-to-find thing.</i>

1075
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:54,413
<i>Move, move. Move your head over.
He's got to see me. Hey, boss!</i>

1076
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:57,697
They have the fi nal piece
and are heading back.

1077
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:00,773
Countdown to the big show
is officially on.

1078
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:02,772
And we are ready for action!

1079
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:09,932
All systems are, uh... Standing by.

1080
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:13,611
Can you taste it, Sensei Shredder?

1081
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:16,768
The magnificence of
what we're about to do?

1082
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:20,173
Yummy, isn't it?

1083
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:33,657
Aren't there supposed to be, like,

1084
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:37,335
pretty stewardesses handing out
warm hand towels and stuff?

1085
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:39,379
Not down here, Mikey.

1086
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:41,459
Not for us.

1087
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:50,255
Oh, boy. Bebop
and Rocksteady are en route

1088
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:51,780
- back to New York.
- What?

1089
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:52,996
They must have already retrieved

1090
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:55,375
the last piece they needed
to open the portal.

1091
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:57,756
Looks like our plane's about
to cross over theirs, right?

1092
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:59,850
Yeah, with
a 3,000-foot separation.

1093
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:02,574
Uh, I could plot a course for intercept,
but we'd have to jump.

1094
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:04,015
Jump?

1095
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:12,780
Oh, boy.

1096
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:15,330
Guys, I don't know
if this is such a good plan.

1097
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:18,059
Oh, Come on, don't go
getting soft on me now, Raph.

1098
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:19,852
This is gonna be fun.

1099
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:26,419
We got to go now.
We only have a 30-second window.

1100
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:27,728
You know the plan.

1101
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:30,696
- Uh... Dudes?
- What?

1102
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:32,099
He jumped.

1103
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:35,418
- He jumped?
- Uh-huh.

1104
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:36,933
All right, one for all.

1105
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:38,476
Wait, wait, wait! You don't have a chute!

1106
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:39,500
Whoo!

1107
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:42,580
I don't need a chute. I got my board!

1108
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:46,418
Oh! This is awesome!

1109
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:11,053
I'm off.

1110
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:12,613
I'm off... I'm off target!

1111
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:14,099
Need a lift, bro?

1112
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:17,814
- Slow down, Mikey!
- Prepare for the ouch.

1113
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:21,418
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

1114
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:23,060
Gotcha!

1115
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:27,373
Hang on, Mikey.

1116
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:33,615
Lock in.

1117
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:37,133
Where's Raph?

1118
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:42,936
Okay. Okay, you got this. You got this.

1119
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:48,252
What would Vin Diesel do?

1120
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:50,698
No regret, no fear.

1121
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:52,811
No regret, no fear.

1122
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:55,535
No regret... No fear!

1123
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:00,420
Ahhh! I regret this! Fear sucks!

1124
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:04,011
Isn't he coming in kind of fast?

1125
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:19,128
Raph!

1126
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:22,649
Nice catch.

1127
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:29,340
Uh-oh!

1128
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:33,617
The good news is you're wearing chutes.

1129
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:34,735
Chutes.

1130
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:35,889
The bad news is...

1131
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:43,419
Okay. This must be
what they came to Brazil for.

1132
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:45,934
It's the interdimensional
portal-opening thingy-ma-bob.

1133
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:49,217
Well, there's probably
a more technical name for it, but...

1134
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:50,528
Uh...

1135
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:52,858
Guys?

1136
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:54,289
Oh.

1137
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:55,380
Oh, boy.

1138
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:01,888
Dude! Bringing back the Mohawk!

1139
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:03,095
Good for you.

1140
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,036
Y'all got jokes, huh?

1141
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:08,336
Well, let's see how funny you are
after we bash your heads in!

1142
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:13,654
Watch it!

1143
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:15,049
Careful!

1144
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:17,979
Mommy!

1145
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:22,175
Guys!

1146
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:35,778
Dude! Seriously?

1147
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:38,215
Yep, that's my bad.
I got a little carried away.

1148
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:44,339
I got it! I got it!

1149
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:46,536
- I'll take that.
- I don't got it.

1150
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:49,216
Don't worry, guys,
I'll level out the plane!

1151
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:52,813
And there's no cockpit.

1152
01:10:58,260 --> 01:11:01,218
Careful, as some of the items
may have shifted during flight.

1153
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:17,936
Oh!

1154
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:22,730
How you
doing up there, Donnie?

1155
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:26,335
Uh... Everything is great.
I'm doing awesome.

1156
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:28,420
Oh!

1157
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:45,500
Whoa!

1158
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:50,499
- This pig is flying!
- Leo!

1159
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:03,740
Raph!

1160
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:30,530
- Everyone okay?
- I'm good.

1161
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:32,688
I'm good!

1162
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:34,253
Wait, where's Raph?

1163
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:40,850
Land!

1164
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:45,491
Land! Land! Land!

1165
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:55,214
Well, this is awkward.

1166
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:59,218
Let's rumble, baby!

1167
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:07,059
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa...

1168
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:16,894
I got you, I got you.

1169
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:19,056
- Leo, no!
- Eyes up, Donnie!

1170
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:20,409
Coming through!

1171
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:25,889
Gotcha!

1172
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:31,300
Aw!

1173
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:35,134
I got it, I got it, I got it!

1174
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:39,419
Donnie!

1175
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:53,414
Thanks, buddy.

1176
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:55,252
- My man.
- My man!

1177
01:13:56,860 --> 01:13:58,373
Bye, turtles!

1178
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:00,650
That's nice of them to say good-bye.

1179
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,411
- Heads up!
- Wait, what?

1180
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:23,979
Thanks, guys.

1181
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:25,895
Real team effort.

1182
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:34,488
If you're gonna press charges,
just press charges.

1183
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:36,133
And you still owe her a phone call.

1184
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:39,411
I don't owe anybody anything

1185
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:42,299
until you tell me
where those turtle things came from.

1186
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:43,699
From New Hampshire.

1187
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:44,820
Wow.

1188
01:14:45,340 --> 01:14:47,376
You're actually even
a bigger loser than I thought.

1189
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:56,373
Don't worry about her, Casey.
She's just trying to get under your skin.

1190
01:14:56,660 --> 01:14:58,218
Nah, she's right.

1191
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:00,491
Been hearing that my whole life.

1192
01:15:00,620 --> 01:15:03,373
You know, I've only
ever really had one goal.

1193
01:15:04,020 --> 01:15:07,057
I wanted to make detective
in the New York City Police Department.

1194
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:10,851
I wanted to put criminals away,
not just keep them in cages.

1195
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:15,576
But working Corrections,
you do learn two good things.

1196
01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:18,333
One, justice comes
in all shapes and sizes.

1197
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:20,420
And two,

1198
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:23,850
it's way easier to pick
a cop's pocket than you might think.

1199
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:28,579
Make your call.

1200
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:40,895
- Yeah?
- Vern...

1201
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:42,448
O'Neil!

1202
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:44,260
Vern, listen, I need you to...

1203
01:15:46,740 --> 01:15:48,093
What is that sound?

1204
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:50,296
Just a little side venture. Falcon breath.

1205
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:52,695
Turns out, people
are willing to pay $200 a pop

1206
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:53,895
for a bag of my hot air.

1207
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:55,300
Okay, look, forget that I asked.

1208
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:57,053
Casey and I are in police custody.

1209
01:15:57,500 --> 01:15:58,649
Shocking!

1210
01:15:58,740 --> 01:15:59,916
Why would they want to question you?

1211
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:01,876
I mean, just because
you broke into their headquarters.

1212
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:04,436
Vern, look, I've got bigger problems
than myself right now, okay?

1213
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:07,020
Baxter Stockman doctored
the footage from TCRI,

1214
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:09,276
but I'm betting that
there's some sort of a secondary feed

1215
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:10,876
that will show that
he's been working with Shredder

1216
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:13,036
and that they turned Bebop
and Rocksteady into mutants.

1217
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:15,528
Look, uh... What do you want from me?

1218
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:18,940
I want you to be the hero
that the whole city thinks you are.

1219
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:32,493
- Coming through.
- It's a restricted area.

1220
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:34,139
"Restricted"?

1221
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:36,891
You know, I know
something that will open

1222
01:16:36,980 --> 01:16:38,857
just about any door in this town.

1223
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:40,848
Key to the city.

1224
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:42,900
You are The Falcon?

1225
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:46,899
You haven't earned the respect yet
to say my name out loud.

1226
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:49,170
You want to put yourself
on the path to that respect,

1227
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:50,860
run downstairs
and grab me a mochaccino.

1228
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:56,368
Secondary surveillance,
where would you be?

1229
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:57,649
Come on, Vern...

1230
01:16:57,740 --> 01:17:00,732
You were a cameraman
before you got all fancy.

1231
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:05,212
One camera, two camera, three camera.

1232
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:08,698
Why isn't there a fourth...

1233
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:12,378
Hidden camera. Bingo!

1234
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:34,813
<i>Right on time.</i>

1235
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:24,156
<i>You think standing on the
sidelines makes you some kind of hero?</i>

1236
01:18:24,180 --> 01:18:26,420
<i>You can't just
push past me like that, bro!</i>

1237
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:28,660
You were being a nitwit!
You were gonna lose that thing!

1238
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:31,156
I had it right in my hand,
and you acted like I wasn't even there!

1239
01:18:31,180 --> 01:18:33,076
It's not my job to make
your presence known, all right?

1240
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:34,356
Get out of your head and communicate!

1241
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:36,769
Well, what do you expect?
He's all logic, no skills!

1242
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:39,090
Coming from the guy
who's all instinct, no restraint!

1243
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:40,436
Dude, what do you know about anything?

1244
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:41,813
You're all heart and no brains.

1245
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:43,556
How could you?
You may know a lot about strategy,

1246
01:18:43,580 --> 01:18:45,172
but you know nothing about feelings.

1247
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:52,929
Fair enough.

1248
01:18:54,940 --> 01:18:57,010
You want to know
the one thing I am feeling?

1249
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:59,531
We may be brothers,

1250
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:04,212
but we are not a team.

1251
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:33,372
- It's working!
- Yes.

1252
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:35,133
We did it.

1253
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:37,596
Once it's fully powered,
the portal will be just wide enough

1254
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:39,815
for the Technodrome
to come through piece by piece.

1255
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:41,299
This is gonna be insane!

1256
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:45,055
Galileo... Isaac Newton...

1257
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:46,689
Steve Jobs.

1258
01:19:48,180 --> 01:19:51,013
Their names will be
footnotes in the annals of science

1259
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:53,011
after what's about to happen here.

1260
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:13,580
Chief Vincent.

1261
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:16,648
I'm Vern Fenwick.
You might know me as The...

1262
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:19,408
Doesn't matter. Listen.

1263
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:21,093
You need to see this.

1264
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:24,533
<i>- Hey, Rock, who is that?
- O'Neil.</i>

1265
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:27,011
<i>Get that canister!</i>

1266
01:20:32,140 --> 01:20:33,334
Let them go.

1267
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:36,340
Thank you,

1268
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:38,849
"Falcon."

1269
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:40,300
Uh, Chief?

1270
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:42,054
You might need this.

1271
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:44,693
Well played.

1272
01:20:45,260 --> 01:20:49,173
Great. So I've got a rhino
and a warthog to add to our troubles.

1273
01:20:50,020 --> 01:20:51,373
Good looking out.

1274
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:53,449
Anytime.

1275
01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:55,770
I want an APB on a Dr. Baxter Stockman.

1276
01:20:55,860 --> 01:20:57,498
And get a few...

1277
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:54,091
What's happening out there, Donnie?

1278
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:56,854
Oh, my gosh.

1279
01:21:57,700 --> 01:21:59,019
Shredder did it.

1280
01:21:59,860 --> 01:22:01,498
The portal's opening.

1281
01:22:13,420 --> 01:22:14,899
Where did that come from?

1282
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:41,372
Amazing.
This alien warship

1283
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:42,780
is coming through piece by piece.

1284
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:45,930
Hacking into the main data core.

1285
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:48,931
Okay. Ship's designate is

1286
01:22:49,460 --> 01:22:50,654
the Technodrome.

1287
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:54,935
Commanding Officer
goes by the name of Krang.

1288
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:58,617
I don't know that guy, but I hate that guy!

1289
01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:00,356
If Krang were to finish
building this thing,

1290
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:01,859
it wouldn't just be a ship.

1291
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:04,613
It would be a war machine
that would end all life here.

1292
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:06,497
It would be the end of the world.

1293
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:09,090
But there is something we can do.

1294
01:23:09,180 --> 01:23:11,535
The atmosphere around
the Technodrome would be toxic

1295
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:14,009
to anyone with
a standard cardiovascular system.

1296
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:15,255
What are you saying?

1297
01:23:15,340 --> 01:23:17,660
We may be the only ones
who can survive around that portal,

1298
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:19,156
the only ones who can get close enough

1299
01:23:19,180 --> 01:23:21,250
to this T echnodrome to shut it down.

1300
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:23,979
But how? We're being hunted.
They think we're monsters.

1301
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:25,820
Yeah, we're gonna
need the cops at our backs.

1302
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:27,693
They're trying to lock us up.

1303
01:23:29,820 --> 01:23:31,094
Unless...

1304
01:23:34,780 --> 01:23:38,455
One sip, and we'll stay
the same on the inside,

1305
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:41,609
but look like humans on the outside.

1306
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:52,612
Your boyhood is drawing to an end.

1307
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:54,691
You are becoming young men.

1308
01:23:55,580 --> 01:23:58,014
The choice is yours.

1309
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:02,531
I'll do whatever you guys say.

1310
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:04,969
It's your call.

1311
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:43,892
You're sure they're coming?

1312
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:46,928
They're coming.

1313
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:07,295
- Hold your fire.
- Hold your fire.

1314
01:25:07,380 --> 01:25:08,980
<i>Hold your fire.</i>

1315
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:11,291
What are you?

1316
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:14,696
We're not really into labels.

1317
01:25:14,780 --> 01:25:17,658
Some call us freaks. Monsters.

1318
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:20,894
Let's just say
we're four brothers from New York

1319
01:25:21,460 --> 01:25:23,974
who hate bullies and love this city.

1320
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:26,611
And right now, we're the city's best hope.

1321
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:29,652
Why should I believe you?

1322
01:25:30,220 --> 01:25:32,211
You don't have to take it from us.

1323
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:34,813
Take it from him.

1324
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:39,415
Go ahead, Vern.

1325
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:41,580
Tell her about the arrangement.

1326
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:43,292
What arrangement?

1327
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:48,733
Oh, that... Arrangement.

1328
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:51,820
Look, The Falcon is still The Falcon.

1329
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:55,813
I just may have gotten by
with a little help from my friends.

1330
01:25:57,580 --> 01:26:01,255
These four are the ones
who took Shredder down the first time.

1331
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:03,893
I was kind of more of a wingman.

1332
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:06,289
We've been doing our part
to protect this city

1333
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:08,174
from the shadows.

1334
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:17,809
And we think we have something to offer.

1335
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:23,331
- We're gonna need...
- Strategy.

1336
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:26,059
Instinct.

1337
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:28,928
Logic.

1338
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:30,898
And boatloads of heart.

1339
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:38,769
Load up!

1340
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:40,740
April, Casey and Vern
need an escort to Pier 90.

1341
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:43,248
The electromagnetic force
of the portal is coming from there.

1342
01:26:43,340 --> 01:26:44,580
Forwarding you the coordinates.

1343
01:26:44,620 --> 01:26:45,973
Send a team!

1344
01:26:47,140 --> 01:26:48,460
Take us to the Chrysler Building.

1345
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:52,135
We'll make our way up to his ship
and take down Krang on his home turf.

1346
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:02,378
Come on, O'Neil, get in!

1347
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:13,956
I installed
a breathing apparatus in your helmet.

1348
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:15,971
This will help us survive
the unique atmosphere

1349
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:17,533
of the assembling Technodrome.

1350
01:27:17,620 --> 01:27:21,010
And I made a handheld version
of the teleportation devi...

1351
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:26,298
Look at what we've done.
This is undeniable.

1352
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:27,859
We'll be gods to future generations.

1353
01:27:28,340 --> 01:27:30,171
I'll be a god.

1354
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:32,330
You'll be just what you've always been.

1355
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:35,019
What's that?

1356
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:37,099
A footnote.

1357
01:27:41,060 --> 01:27:43,654
- No.
- Take him to our facility in Tokyo.

1358
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:48,931
No! No! No! No! No!
You can't do this to me!

1359
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:51,090
No, you... No. No, you will... No!

1360
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:54,139
I've done everything you asked!
You promised! No!

1361
01:27:54,220 --> 01:27:57,610
I am a legend! I will be...
No! I will be a legend!

1362
01:27:58,060 --> 01:27:59,459
You cannot do this to me.

1363
01:28:00,180 --> 01:28:01,613
The world will know my name!

1364
01:28:02,140 --> 01:28:04,495
No one will ever know who you are.

1365
01:28:17,820 --> 01:28:19,651
We're 90 seconds out.

1366
01:28:20,020 --> 01:28:22,853
I've got tactical gear, weapons,
communications standing by.

1367
01:28:22,940 --> 01:28:24,578
All we need is cover to get up there.

1368
01:28:24,660 --> 01:28:26,260
When we do,
we've got to find that beacon

1369
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:27,940
that's drawing all those pieces together.

1370
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:29,916
If we can send that beacon
back to where it came from,

1371
01:28:29,940 --> 01:28:32,579
and April, Casey and Vern
can close that portal on our command...

1372
01:28:32,660 --> 01:28:34,059
Good-bye, T echnodrome.

1373
01:28:34,180 --> 01:28:35,579
Good-bye, Krang.

1374
01:28:36,740 --> 01:28:38,139
T eam effort.

1375
01:28:39,340 --> 01:28:40,693
T eam effort.

1376
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:47,036
All right, they're splitting up.

1377
01:28:47,060 --> 01:28:48,276
Wait, we aren't going with the turtles?

1378
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:49,716
Why aren't we going with the turtles?

1379
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:52,100
When something bad happens,
you want to be with the turtles!

1380
01:29:19,460 --> 01:29:20,779
Commander Krang.

1381
01:29:20,940 --> 01:29:23,056
There you are, Shredder!

1382
01:29:23,140 --> 01:29:25,051
I thought you'd never get here.

1383
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:28,657
As you asked, the beacon has been set.

1384
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:33,018
And once the Technodrome
reassembles, we can rule the planet.

1385
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:35,011
I'm sorry. "We"?

1386
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:37,212
"We" will rule?

1387
01:29:37,540 --> 01:29:39,531
We were a team.

1388
01:29:39,740 --> 01:29:41,173
"We were a team!"

1389
01:29:41,260 --> 01:29:43,091
Teams are for the weak.

1390
01:29:43,180 --> 01:29:45,535
Family is for the scared.

1391
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:48,568
The Earth is my toy!

1392
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:52,209
And I do not like to share!

1393
01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:53,608
You betrayed me!

1394
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:57,097
Actually, I barely even thought about you.

1395
01:29:59,700 --> 01:30:04,171
Back in the toy chest
with the rest of the things I've broken.

1396
01:30:04,580 --> 01:30:07,413
Silly little earthling.

1397
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:15,211
Now for a new game.

1398
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:18,372
Look out, Earth! It's playtime.

1399
01:30:20,860 --> 01:30:22,134
Move it, let's go!

1400
01:30:28,180 --> 01:30:30,774
Go, move, move, move.
Get your team in position!

1401
01:30:31,140 --> 01:30:32,140
Shields up!

1402
01:30:32,940 --> 01:30:36,296
- Okay, let's get them in.
- Tight form on that barricade!

1403
01:30:37,460 --> 01:30:38,609
Advance!

1404
01:30:40,300 --> 01:30:41,300
Keep it tight!

1405
01:30:54,940 --> 01:30:56,293
- Casey!
- Hold on!

1406
01:30:58,420 --> 01:30:59,739
I'm going in.

1407
01:31:11,220 --> 01:31:12,653
Casey! Casey!

1408
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:29,697
This thing's 57% complete.

1409
01:31:29,780 --> 01:31:30,780
If we don't stop it now,

1410
01:31:30,820 --> 01:31:33,015
it's gonna be ready to go
in less than four minutes.

1411
01:31:34,060 --> 01:31:35,780
Guys,
what are we waiting for?

1412
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:38,171
- You got this?
- Yeah.

1413
01:31:38,580 --> 01:31:39,808
I got this.

1414
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:41,618
Surf's up, New York!

1415
01:32:07,180 --> 01:32:08,772
Do you hear that?

1416
01:32:08,860 --> 01:32:10,293
It sounds strange.

1417
01:32:10,380 --> 01:32:12,610
Like "alien spacecraft
in the sky" strange?

1418
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:14,135
No.

1419
01:32:15,420 --> 01:32:16,739
That kind of strange.

1420
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:26,336
We've got to keep
our eyes out for intruders.

1421
01:32:26,420 --> 01:32:28,376
Well, what do intruders look like?

1422
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:30,690
Anybody that's not
a big pig or a big rhino.

1423
01:32:30,780 --> 01:32:31,780
Ah.

1424
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:34,856
Oh. Oh, boy. Listen.

1425
01:32:35,580 --> 01:32:37,491
You guys secure the portal device.

1426
01:32:41,180 --> 01:32:42,329
I'll deal with those two.

1427
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:44,580
"Secure the portal device"?
What does that even mean?

1428
01:32:44,660 --> 01:32:46,700
It means kick the butt
of anyone that's guarding it,

1429
01:32:46,780 --> 01:32:48,736
wait for Donnie's go signal,
and shut it down.

1430
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:50,676
Yeah, but we don't know
how many people are guarding it!

1431
01:32:50,700 --> 01:32:51,849
Well, do you want to switch?

1432
01:32:56,940 --> 01:32:58,516
Yeah, no. We're gonna secure the portal.

1433
01:32:58,540 --> 01:32:59,859
I thought so.

1434
01:33:00,060 --> 01:33:01,095
Hey, fellas!

1435
01:33:02,180 --> 01:33:03,295
Remember me?

1436
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:07,137
- Look who it is.
- Hey, cop, how's your noggin?

1437
01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:10,298
- Come on!
- As you wish.

1438
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:12,179
It's on, baby!

1439
01:33:20,660 --> 01:33:21,854
Ultrasonic scanners indicate

1440
01:33:21,940 --> 01:33:24,076
the beacon's location is
somewhere near the command module

1441
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:25,215
a few hundred feet ahead.

1442
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:27,276
Okay. We've got to stop
this thing from completing.

1443
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:29,097
And how are we
supposed to do that?

1444
01:33:29,180 --> 01:33:31,140
Let's start
with whatever that thing is.

1445
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:36,738
That must be Krang.

1446
01:33:37,060 --> 01:33:38,618
All right, fall in, guys!

1447
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:57,300
Whoa.

1448
01:33:57,660 --> 01:33:59,491
It's not that bad, it's just a dumb robot.

1449
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:04,976
Huh. I was expecting way worse.

1450
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:06,853
And what would that look like?

1451
01:34:06,940 --> 01:34:09,329
I don't know, like a mustache maybe?

1452
01:34:09,460 --> 01:34:11,276
Evil goatee or something.
You know what I'm saying?

1453
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:12,858
Ahhh!

1454
01:34:14,820 --> 01:34:17,493
It's like a chewed-up
piece of gum! With a face!

1455
01:34:17,620 --> 01:34:20,851
I'll only warn you once. Get off my ship!

1456
01:34:21,380 --> 01:34:22,859
Donnie, get to the console.

1457
01:34:22,940 --> 01:34:25,500
Let's send this jacked-up disco ball
back where it came from.

1458
01:34:26,060 --> 01:34:28,415
Hey, Bubblicious,
let's see what you've got.

1459
01:34:28,780 --> 01:34:32,056
I'll show you what I've got! This!

1460
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:35,972
This dude's tougher than I thought.

1461
01:34:39,220 --> 01:34:40,619
You better run!

1462
01:34:40,740 --> 01:34:43,254
You cannot escape the Bebop!

1463
01:34:54,260 --> 01:34:56,251
What? Why me?

1464
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:05,611
Let's go! Come on, Mikey!

1465
01:35:06,260 --> 01:35:08,057
You're going down, Krang!

1466
01:35:11,580 --> 01:35:14,856
Okay. About ninety seconds
before this thing is complete.

1467
01:35:14,940 --> 01:35:16,259
All you, Donnie.

1468
01:35:17,620 --> 01:35:20,088
No pressure, no pressure, no pressure.

1469
01:35:20,460 --> 01:35:23,816
You know,
I'm looking forward to enslaving you.

1470
01:35:23,900 --> 01:35:27,370
A cage full of tortoises might be nice.

1471
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:30,572
We're turtles, not tortoises!
There's a big difference.

1472
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:33,660
Yeah. Turtles bite!

1473
01:35:35,420 --> 01:35:37,934
You don't think I've got spares for this?

1474
01:35:42,100 --> 01:35:44,250
Guys, he is literally rearming.

1475
01:35:48,620 --> 01:35:50,258
Gotcha, pipsqueak!

1476
01:35:54,740 --> 01:35:55,740
Whoa!

1477
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:11,049
You see him, Rock?

1478
01:36:11,140 --> 01:36:12,778
We know you're here somewhere.

1479
01:36:15,820 --> 01:36:18,380
- Donnie!
- Just give me ten seconds.

1480
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:23,252
Guys? I don't think
I'm tall enough to ride this ride!

1481
01:36:23,340 --> 01:36:26,377
Stupid reptiles!

1482
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:30,380
Leo, hang on!

1483
01:36:41,060 --> 01:36:43,699
You're starting to be
a real pain in my butt.

1484
01:36:43,820 --> 01:36:46,892
And do you know
what Bebop does with pains in his butt?

1485
01:36:50,420 --> 01:36:51,739
Get over here, little boy.

1486
01:36:51,860 --> 01:36:54,090
Put down that popsicle stick.

1487
01:36:55,340 --> 01:36:57,171
Ha! Game on, baby!

1488
01:36:59,540 --> 01:37:01,100
Look. There's the portal device.

1489
01:37:01,540 --> 01:37:03,735
Oh, great. She has a sword.

1490
01:37:05,180 --> 01:37:07,057
We have a hubcap.

1491
01:37:07,860 --> 01:37:10,374
Where's the beacon, Donnie?
We're running out of time!

1492
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:12,491
You already have.

1493
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:16,575
Prepare to watch your city crumble.

1494
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:17,996
What's happening, Donnie?

1495
01:37:18,020 --> 01:37:20,488
I was right.
It's a massive weapons system.

1496
01:37:20,620 --> 01:37:21,689
He's bringing it online!

1497
01:37:28,380 --> 01:37:31,372
I got it! I found the beacon! It's just

1498
01:37:32,700 --> 01:37:35,373
up there.

1499
01:37:36,460 --> 01:37:39,054
- Mikey, go!
- Oh, I'll get that beacon.

1500
01:37:39,540 --> 01:37:40,859
Okay, turtles.

1501
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:43,530
Play time is over!

1502
01:37:48,420 --> 01:37:49,420
Whoa!

1503
01:37:59,900 --> 01:38:01,891
I'm vertical!

1504
01:38:02,260 --> 01:38:03,740
Oh, you want some, too?

1505
01:38:07,900 --> 01:38:09,731
I got it!

1506
01:38:11,220 --> 01:38:12,335
Get him, Rock!

1507
01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:31,217
Whoa, stop, stop!

1508
01:38:38,780 --> 01:38:40,657
Oh, no.

1509
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:49,060
- Rock.
- Yeah, Beebs?

1510
01:38:49,660 --> 01:38:51,139
My man.

1511
01:38:51,900 --> 01:38:53,379
Hey! Heads up, Donnie.

1512
01:38:55,020 --> 01:38:56,339
The beacon!

1513
01:38:57,100 --> 01:38:59,216
Come here, little turtle.

1514
01:39:00,820 --> 01:39:02,299
Let me give you a hug.

1515
01:39:02,980 --> 01:39:04,208
Good-bye.

1516
01:39:05,420 --> 01:39:06,860
Okay.

1517
01:39:06,940 --> 01:39:08,293
Raph! With me!

1518
01:39:15,020 --> 01:39:16,135
Little help, guys!

1519
01:39:16,220 --> 01:39:17,420
Hang on, little bro!

1520
01:39:21,700 --> 01:39:24,009
Nobody messes...

1521
01:39:25,420 --> 01:39:26,739
With Mikey!

1522
01:39:26,820 --> 01:39:28,333
No!

1523
01:39:36,620 --> 01:39:40,010
Guys, Krang is down,
but his ship's still building.

1524
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:50,860
Come on.

1525
01:39:58,980 --> 01:39:59,980
Donnie!

1526
01:40:00,740 --> 01:40:02,093
Drone activated.

1527
01:40:16,700 --> 01:40:18,292
It's gonna be close.

1528
01:40:25,180 --> 01:40:27,011
<i>Guys, now! Close the portal now!</i>

1529
01:40:27,220 --> 01:40:28,220
I got this.

1530
01:40:42,220 --> 01:40:44,051
Yes!

1531
01:41:00,300 --> 01:41:02,291
Okay, this is our stop.

1532
01:41:08,540 --> 01:41:10,337
I'll be back, turtles,

1533
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:13,573
a thousand times stronger!

1534
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:29,692
It's cool. It's cool.

1535
01:41:29,780 --> 01:41:31,736
Yeah, I knew that would work.

1536
01:41:31,820 --> 01:41:33,516
Wait, so you seriously
thought us four teenagers

1537
01:41:33,540 --> 01:41:34,814
could save the whole world?

1538
01:41:34,940 --> 01:41:35,975
Sure.

1539
01:41:36,060 --> 01:41:38,574
Guys, we got something
no one else has.

1540
01:41:40,460 --> 01:41:42,212
- Turtle power!
- Garbage truck!

1541
01:41:42,340 --> 01:41:43,932
Garbage truck?

1542
01:41:44,020 --> 01:41:46,853
- Well, we do have one.
- The other one.

1543
01:41:47,380 --> 01:41:49,336
Turtle power!

1544
01:41:51,300 --> 01:41:53,131
<i>Escaped convicts
Bebop and Rocksteady</i>

1545
01:41:53,220 --> 01:41:54,414
<i>are now in police custody,</i>

1546
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:57,139
while Dr. Baxter Stockman
remains at large.

1547
01:41:57,260 --> 01:41:59,774
Authorities assure us that
the city is once again safe,

1548
01:41:59,900 --> 01:42:02,733
however questions remain
about last week's events.

1549
01:42:02,860 --> 01:42:04,612
What was that threat from the sky

1550
01:42:04,740 --> 01:42:06,458
and how exactly was it averted?

1551
01:42:06,620 --> 01:42:09,054
But the bigger question is,
does it even matter?

1552
01:42:09,140 --> 01:42:12,018
Do we need to give our heroes
a name and a face?

1553
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:14,576
<i>Or is it enough
to know that they're out there</i>

1554
01:42:14,660 --> 01:42:16,810
<i>watching over us from the shadows?</i>

1555
01:42:17,300 --> 01:42:20,895
For your incredible valor
within this community,

1556
01:42:20,980 --> 01:42:24,893
and for your uncompromising
cooperation with this agency,

1557
01:42:25,140 --> 01:42:27,574
I present to you the keys to the city,

1558
01:42:28,620 --> 01:42:30,975
a symbol of our appreciation,

1559
01:42:31,420 --> 01:42:32,614
respect,

1560
01:42:32,740 --> 01:42:34,810
and for our continued partnership.

1561
01:42:35,660 --> 01:42:37,935
To you brothers,

1562
01:42:38,740 --> 01:42:40,093
Leonardo,

1563
01:42:40,940 --> 01:42:44,455
Raphael, Donatello, Michelangelo...

1564
01:42:47,060 --> 01:42:48,095
Uh...

1565
01:42:48,340 --> 01:42:49,375
Last name?

1566
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:52,411
Uh... Not so much.

1567
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:54,491
I never thought of that. That's no fair.

1568
01:42:55,860 --> 01:42:57,100
Congratulations.

1569
01:43:07,860 --> 01:43:10,010
I got one of those. No big deal.

1570
01:43:11,980 --> 01:43:14,016
I helped them. They're friends of mine.

1571
01:43:14,140 --> 01:43:15,140
Oh.

1572
01:43:15,540 --> 01:43:17,019
So, you got plans next weekend?

1573
01:43:17,660 --> 01:43:18,854
Just my regular hockey game.

1574
01:43:19,540 --> 01:43:21,053
Do you want to come watch me play?

1575
01:43:21,140 --> 01:43:23,210
Watch? I'll take you one on one.

1576
01:43:23,700 --> 01:43:25,213
And I'll kick your butt.

1577
01:43:25,980 --> 01:43:27,174
I bet you will.

1578
01:43:29,780 --> 01:43:30,974
My key's totally bigger.

1579
01:43:31,060 --> 01:43:33,020
It's bigger than your key, man.
I got the big key.

1580
01:43:35,100 --> 01:43:37,375
I think you should
give people more credit.

1581
01:43:37,540 --> 01:43:38,540
They'll accept you now.

1582
01:43:40,220 --> 01:43:41,972
You're probably right.

1583
01:43:43,140 --> 01:43:44,414
But, uh...

1584
01:43:45,740 --> 01:43:47,935
I think we'll stick with
the arrangement we've had.

1585
01:43:48,580 --> 01:43:51,652
If you ever need us,
April knows where to find us.

1586
01:43:52,060 --> 01:43:53,060
Really?

1587
01:43:53,820 --> 01:43:56,129
You could live a normal life,

1588
01:43:57,060 --> 01:43:58,175
like the rest of us.

1589
01:43:59,180 --> 01:44:00,499
Normal?

1590
01:44:02,300 --> 01:44:03,972
What fun is that?

1591
01:44:21,100 --> 01:44:22,100
Yeah!
