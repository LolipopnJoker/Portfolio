The Russians put that Sputnik

at Ebbets Field...

in the head and missed.

Turns out the local cops were
watching Joe Barbara like a hawk...

...and some deputy sheriff notices
all the traffic and calls the feds.

they moved out.

in the field with some hay or corn...

while my father holds out...

...this .44 cannon he used to carry,
and hijacked the tractor.

34

The story is they drove it
all the way to Bensonhurst...

35
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:23,577
...but my father told me they
only got as far as Poughkeepsie.

343
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,300
Oh. Go ahead, then.

344
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,304
What do we do?
What, we sit?

345
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,265
Whatever makes you comfortable.

346
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,558
I'll sit over here.

347
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,228
I'm going to sit here.

348
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,605
If you're comfortable, it's fine.

349
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,156
So who starts?

350
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,409
Tell me why you think
you need therapy.

351
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:25,371
I don't need therapy.
I told you that. lt's for my friend.

352
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,331
-l'm sorry.
-You didn't hear me say that?

353
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,541
I'm sorry.

354
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:32,628
You're supposed to be good at listening.
You can't remember what l said?

355
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,046
So sorry.

356
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:37,800
I ain't thrilled with the level of service
up to this point.

357
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:41,304
-That was my fault. I apologize.
-Yeah.

358
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,931
Why don't we start over?

359
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,601
Why don't you just tell me
about your friend?

360
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:52,440
This friend, you know,
he's a very powerful guy.

361
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,317
Never had trouble
dealing with nothing.

362
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,861
All of a sudden, he's falling apart...

363
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,947
...he cries for no reason,
he can't sleep...

364
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,949
...he can't be with his friends.

365
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,535
All of a sudden,
he gets nervous around them.

366
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,370
He wants to get away from them.

367
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,582
And these are guys he knows
his whole life, you know?

368
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,709
And then he has these attacks.

369
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:16,005
He can't breathe, he gets dizzy...

370
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,549
...chest pains, you know....

371
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,469
He thinks he's gonna
die or something.

372
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,845
Panic attacks.

373
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,847
What's it with you guys
and panic attacks?

374
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,975
Who said "panic"?
Who said "panic"?

375
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,268
Not panic.

376
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,979
Dizzy, chest-breathing,
constricting...

377
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,981
...attacks.

378
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,860
This guy, he just wants to know
what he can do to make it stop.

379
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:43,741
Mr. Vitti,
I'm gonna go out on a limb here.

380
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,662
I think your friend...

381
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,039


...is you.

382
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:58,381
You. You....

383
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,425
You got a gift, my friend.

384
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,761
You got a gift.

385
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,346
Oh, yeah.

386
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,307
You saw that there was something
I was trying to do...

387
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,060
...and figured it out.
That's why you are who you are.

388
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,479
God bless you.
You got a fucking gift.

389
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:17,400
-No, I don't.
-Yes, you do.

390
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,403
Go on.

391
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,697
-What?
-Go on.

392
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,156
I think...

393
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,701
...medication could help.

394
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,077
Drugs?

395
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,121
Can't do drugs.
I don't do drugs.

396
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,874
If you want to get to
the root of the problem...

397
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,876
...you'll want to get
some form of therapy.

398
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,087
Like what?
With you or something?

399
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:41,382
Me? No, l don't think you want--

400
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,343
My roster of patients is full.

401
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:48,097
I'm full right now.
Plus, l'm leaving on a short vacation.

402
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,598
Where you going?

403
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,976
-l don't share that with patients.
-Where?

404
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:54,770
Sheraton Bal Harbor Hotel
in Miami Beach.

405
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,522
That wasn't so hard, was it?

406
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,232
No, it wasn't.

407
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,946
You know, it's a funny
kind of a thing...

408
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,408
...but l feel better after
I got all that off my chest.

409
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,160
I feel like a load...

410
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,329
...a load is off my shoulders.

411
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,165
-You're good.
-l--

412
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,541
Doc, thank you.

413
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,336
-l didn't do anything.
-You did.

414
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:19,837
-l did nothing.
-You did too.

415
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,298
The load, gone. Where is it?

416
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,799
Don't know.

417
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,594
You're good. Nah, nah.

418
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,596
You're good, Doc.

-Don't, please.
-One more thing.

421
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,436
If l talk to you...

422
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:39,440
...and you turn me into a fag,
I'll kill you. Understand?

423
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,151
Could we define "fag"?
Because some feelings...

424
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,653
-...may come up.
-l go fag, you die. Got it?

425
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,781
Simple.

426
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,199
You're good, Doc.

427
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,284
You're good.

428
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,830
-See you, Doc.
-Mm-hm.

429
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,970
We take on Manetta,
what does Vitti do? Nothing.

430
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,472

Well then,
let it come down.

435
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:20,981
Let me tell you,
Vitti's a tough guy...

436
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:24,860
...but a lot of tough guys get fed to
the crabs off Red Hook.

437
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:28,697
Vitti. That name has been
haunting me since l was a kid.

438
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,826
Growing up, he was the smart guy,
I was the dope.

439
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:35,121

Gambino before the meeting.

I want Paul Vitti dead!

-Dad, one thing, though.
-Yeah?

Was that really Paul Vitti?

Mafia decoder ring, but it was him.

-Of course not. Are you crazy?

[GASPS]

516
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:33,275
It's me.

517
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,236
Mr. Vitti wants to see you.
I got your robe.

518

VlTTI: l got news for you, you two-bit prick,
son-of-a-bitch rat bastard...

519
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,954
...you did nothing for me!
Whatever you did, it didn't take.

520
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,415
I'm still fucked up.
You did nothing for me!

521
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:52,002
I did nothing for you?
I saw you for five minutes.

522
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,545
What do you expect?

523
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:57,007
I can't work miracles.
Let me tell you something else.

524
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,677
I don't like it when someone
breaks in...

525
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:01,929
...and kidnaps me
in the middle of the night!

526
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,681
I have a family. I have a life.

527
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,599
And l have a serious practice.

528
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,352
And l don't have time for your bullshit!

529
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,271
That got away from me
at the end there.

530
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,026
I couldn't get it up last night.

531
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:18,487
Do you mean sexually?

532
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,531
I mean for the game
against Michigan State.

533
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,991
Of course, sexually!
What's the matter with you?

534
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,618
Can l get this straight?

535
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:28,205
You flew 1 500 miles,
you dragged me out of bed...

536
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,499
...because you couldn't get
an erection?

537
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,001
Don't that prove l'm motivated?

538
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,878
You can take a pill for that.

539
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,088
That's a cheat.

540
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:38,757
You start with the pills,
next it's hydraulics.

541
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,927
A hard-on should be gotten
legitimately or not at all.

542
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,887
I think Mark Twain said that.

543
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,973
Are you going to help me or not?

544
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,643
I don't believe this.
All right.

545
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,186
Okay.

546
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,688
Has this happened before?

547
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,441
-The dead dick thing?
-Mm-hm.

548
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:58,152
Never.
Well, one time. Last night.

549
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,196
-One more time.
-So twice.

550
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,198
Do the math. Two times.

551
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,244
Then another time, but after
a big meal, so that don't count.

552
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:10,414
Being unable to perform
three or four times is not--

553
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:11,832
Eight times.

554
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,126
Eight times is not catastrophic.

555
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,003
Maybe not to you. Look at you.

556
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,965
But if I can't get it up,
that makes me less of a man.

557
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,092
In my world, I deal with animals.

558
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:25,053
They may seem dumb to
an educated guy like you...

559
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:28,348
...but animals are very cunning
and they sense weakness.

if they don't kill me.

What happens in two weeks?

563
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,690
I can't tell you.
You don't want to know.

564
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:40,027
You can't tell me and I don't
want to know. That's a big help.

565
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,196
You're supposed to tell me.
I do want to know.

566
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,782
That's how this works.
This is impossible.

I can't do anything in two weeks,
and even if I could...

568

...what is my goal? To make you
a happy, well-adjusted gangster?

569
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:54,708
The other day I was watching
a TV commercial...

570
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,585
...some kid playing with puppies.

I just like saying "God rest his soul."
Of course he passed away.

A heart attack.

How was the relationship?
Were you close?

760
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:32,976
Eh, we were pretty close.

761
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,437
We weren't getting along great
right then.

762
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:37,147
Why is that?

763
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,941
I was hanging out in the neighborhood.
I had a borgata.

764
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,401
What is that?

765
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:44,070
A kid gang, nothing big.
But he didn't like that.

766
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,488
-He didn't approve.
-No, no.

767
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,991
He slapped me around
a couple of times.

768
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,492
And what?

769
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:50,994
And then he died.

770
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,413
How'd that make you feel?

771
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:56,124

How'd it make me feel?

Think about it.

Were you angry?
Were you afraid? Sad?

774
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,964
Maybe all those things.

775
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,758
Any feelings of guilt?

776
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,301
About what? I didn't kill him.

777
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,178
I know that,
I'm just speculating...

778
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:12,349
...that maybe in some way
you may have wanted him to die.

779
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,017
Why would l want him to die?

780
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:17,145
You said you were fighting.
He slapped you around...

781
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,564
...because you rebelled
against his authority.

782
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,608
Maybe some unresolved
Oedipal conflict.

783
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,443
English, English.

784
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:27,530
Oedipus was a Greek king who killed
his father and married his mother.

785
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:28,823
Fucking Greeks.

786
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:31,326
It's an instinctual developmental drive.

787
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,661
The young boy wants to
replace his father...

788
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,289
...so that he can
totally possess his mother.

789
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,792
Are you saying
I wanted to fuck my mother?

790
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:42,003
-lt's a primal fantasy.
-Have you ever seen my mother?

791
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,464
-Are you out of your mind?
-lt's Freud!

792
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,509
Freud's a sick fuck, and you are
too for bringing it up.

-Ugh!

I don't think l can call you Dad.

795
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,477
So, what do l call you?
Do I call you Scott?

00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,354

-Yeah, Captain.

-Yes, you can.
-Thank you.

I'm just going to borrow this guy.
I'll bring him right back.

821

And then you'll leave us alone.

00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:09,466
I'll leave you alone.
I got to talk to you.

Two minutes.
Two minutes.

Wait over there.
Don't listen to what we say.

My ears are sealed.

826
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,559
I had a really weird dream
last night.

827
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:22,729
I feel like I'm having one now.
Why'd you interrupt my party?

828
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:25,482
You're really very rigid
about certain things.

829
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,025
Did you know that?

830
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:29,569
All right,
tell me about your dream.

831
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,362
I'm asleep.

832
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:34,199
I hear a baby crying.
I go to the refrigerator.

833
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,992
I get him a bottle of milk.

834
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:37,994
I bring the bottle of milk to him...

835
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,537
...l see the milk is black.

-Get out of here.

837
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,250
-Get out of here.
-Sorry.

838
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:48,421
What does that mean?
And no more filth about my mother.

839
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,548
I don't know.
What does it mean to you?

840
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:54,594
This is why I pay you? I say
something, you say it back to me?

841
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:57,055
I could get Jelly to
do that for nothing.

842
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:59,807
Get Jelly.
I'm going back to my party.

843
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,937
All right.
I'm letting it go this time.

844
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:07,232
Because you're getting married,
I'm going to let it go.

Why don't you look over that way

BEN:
This is a gift.

1852
01:38:23,564 --> 01:38:26,524
[SINGlNG]
I've got the world on a string

1853
01:38:27,943 --> 01:38:30,653
I'm sitting on a rainbow

1854
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:36,242
I've got the string around my finger

1855
01:38:37,703 --> 01:38:40,705
What a world, what a life

1856
01:38:42,124 --> 01:38:44,208
I'm in love

1857
01:38:48,672 --> 01:38:52,508
I've got a song that l sing

1858
01:38:52,843 --> 01:38:55,887
I can make the rain go

1859
01:38:56,600 --> 01:39:01,770
Any time I move my finger

1860
01:39:02,810 --> 01:39:07,230
Lucky me, can't you see?

1861
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:09,945
I'm in love

1862
01:39:12,110 --> 01:39:16,200
Life is a beautiful thing

1863
01:39:18,370 --> 01:39:22,205
As long as l hold that string

1864
01:39:25,085 --> 01:39:28,545
I'd be a silly so-and-so

1865
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:34,260
If I should ever let go

1866
01:39:38,345 --> 01:39:41,600
I've got the world on a string

1867
01:39:42,100 --> 01:39:45,855
I'm sitting on a rainbow

1868
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:51,315
I've got the string around my finger

1869
01:39:51,985 --> 01:39:56,030
What a world, what a life

1870
01:39:56,200 --> 01:40:03,205
I'm in love

1871
01:40:04,415 --> 01:40:06,080
Good night, Sobels.
