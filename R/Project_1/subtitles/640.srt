1
00:00:46,795 --> 00:00:49,175
1957 was a big year.

2
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,010
The Russians put that Sputnik
into outer space.

3
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,135
The Dodgers played their last game
at Ebbets Field...

4
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,765
...and said goodbye to Brooklyn.

5
00:00:56,975 --> 00:01:00,685
That guy, he shot Frank Costello
in the head and missed.

6
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:05,105
The Gallo brothers whacked
Albert Anastasia in that barbershop.

7
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,150
It was total chaos.

8
00:01:07,315 --> 00:01:10,985
With Anastasia out, Vito Genovese
figures he's the big boss.

9
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:12,360
But Carlo Gambino...

10
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,820
...and Joe Bananas had other ideas.

11
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,950
So they called a meeting.

12
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,910
A big meeting.

13
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,510
lt was the first time the whole
Commission would meet face to face.

14
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:35,675
Bosses and wiseguys were coming
from all over the country...

15
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,845
...and all
the New York families too.

16
00:01:38,055 --> 00:01:40,640
Maybe 50 bosses,
the whole wiseguy world...

17
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,936
...all coming
to this little town upstate.

18
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,905
My father went with Dom Manetta
and Tommy D. Fat Tommy.

19
00:01:57,115 --> 00:01:58,825
He was running the family then.

20
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:02,870
Some asshole thought it would be
a good idea to have this meeting...

21
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,375
...at Joe Barbara's farm,
up in the country, nice and quiet.

22
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,375
Get away from the car.

23
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:14,174
Want to be a fucking rib eye?
Get away from the car!

24
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,929
Turns out the local cops were
watching Joe Barbara like a hawk...

25
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:23,392
...and some deputy sheriff notices
all the traffic and calls the feds.

26
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,031
The meeting never even
got started.

27
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,700
The feds moved in...

28
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,162
...and bingo, the bosses,
they moved out.

29
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:05,309
My father and Dominic, they hid
in the field with some hay or corn...

30
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,060
...some kind of foliage, l don't know.

31
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,353
Along comes a farmer.

32
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,773
Dominic bullshits him
while my father holds out...

33
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,694
...this .44 cannon he used to carry,
and hijacked the tractor.

34
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:19,781
The story is they drove it
all the way to Bensonhurst...

35
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:23,577
...but my father told me they
only got as far as Poughkeepsie.

36
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,917
Carlo Gambino, he came out of it...

37
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,377
...capo di tutti capi,
boss of all bosses...

38
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:36,882
...and that was the last time
the Commission tried to meet until now.

39
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,144
I don't know, l don't like it.
What do we got to meet for?

40
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,356
Let everybody else worry about
their own business.

41
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:56,944
The '57 meeting was about how we were
going to divide this country.

42
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:00,197
This meeting is how we're
going to survive.

43
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:05,410
You got made guys
informing for the feds.

44
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,663
Bosses are going to jail.

45
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,998
People are getting whacked
without permission.

46
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,584
And on top of everything else...

47
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,544
...you got these Chinese...

48
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:17,297
...and these crazy Russians
to deal with.

49
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:19,049
Everything is changing.

50
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,969
We got to change with the times.

51
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,221
Are we going to get
a fucking Website?

52
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,390
When your papa died...

53
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:33,188
...l made him a promise
that I'd always look out for you.

54
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,900
I want you to come to
that meeting with me.

55
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:51,456
Listen. This guy, Primo Sindone,
you watch out for him.

56
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,375
He's a scumbag.

57
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,377
Keep your eye on him, okay?

58
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,925
Let me get a toothpick.
I'll be right there.

59
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,707
l just kept telling him
that I needed room...

60
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,417
...to grow...

61
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:40,589
...and to find myself as a person.

62
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,800
You know?
Not just as a woman...

63
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,887
...but as an independent entity.

64
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:50,557
Then l told him I needed to get
in touch with my uniqueness...

65
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,976
...but he could not handle that.

66
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:56,438
He said that l was
driving him away.

67
00:05:56,606 --> 00:06:00,442
He said l was driving him away.

68
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,738
Do you think I was
driving him away, Dr. Sobel?

69
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,658
Caroline, things end.

70
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:12,871
It's a part of life. It's how we deal
with things ending that's important.

71
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,331
I just cannot believe...

72
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,376
...that it's over between
me and Steve, you know?

73
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,795
I mean, maybe there's still hope.

74
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,547
He took out a restraining order
against you.

75
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:25,592
I have to be honest,
that's usually not a good sign.

76
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,011
But what should I do?

77
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,680
Well...

78
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,725
...the first thing that l think
you should do...

79
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:37,979
...is to stop whining about
this pathetic loser. For chrissakes!

80
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,940
You are a tragedy queen!

81
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,818
"Steve doesn't like me.
Steve doesn't respect me."

82
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:45,153
Who gives a shit?
Get a fucking life!

83
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,366
Dr. Sobel?

84
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,120
Yes. Yes, l, uh....

85
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,665
I was reflecting on your situation.

86
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,126
It's interesting,
what you were saying.

87
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,710
I want you to think about it.

88
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,338
And l'm going to think about it.

89
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,923
We'll both think about it--

90
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,967
Okay.

91
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:10,011
--and continue next week
when l get back from vacation.

92
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,684
Caroline, what are you feeling?

93
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,520
You're just like Steve.
You just want to--

94
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,147
You just want to...

95
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,149
...get rid of me
and throw me out.

96
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,984
You know that's not true.

97
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,193
Yes, it's true.

98
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,862
I'll see you next week...

99
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,614
...whereas Steve never wants
to see you again.

100
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,500
Please, Mr. Vitti.

101
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,586
I said l don't know nothing,
but they don't believe me...

102
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,589
...because that time I said Little Joe
hit Dukey and he didn't.

103
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,633
I didn't know because Little Joe
looked just like that--

104
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,218
Shut the fuck up!

105
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,889
You know me, right?

106
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:55,098
You're Mr. Vitti.

107
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,309
You know what l'll do to you
if you lie?

108
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:00,604
You'll crack me on the head
with that pipe.

109
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,231
It's a rhetorical question,
you idiot.

110
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,109
Who killed Dominic?

111
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,986
-Who killed Dominic?
-l don't know!

112
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,238
Who killed Dominic?
-l don't know!

113
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:11,406
I swear to God--

114
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,782
Don't fucking lie!

115
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,327
You little motherfucker!
Who killed Dom?

116
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,881
He don't know nothing.
Forget it.

117
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,348
That was relatively painless.

118
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,557
Shut the fuck up!

119
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,684
That hurt.

120
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,563
We're not going anywhere.

121
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,816
We've sat here for ten minutes.
I hate being late.

122
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,945
-l hate walking into that house late.
-Dad, relax.

123
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,448
You're like this because
you're mad we have to go to Grandpa's.

124
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,283
Please don't analyze me.

125
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:58,954
I can't be analyzed by somebody who,
until recently, believed in Santa.

126
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,915
There is one Dr. Sobel
in this family. Just one.

127
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,835
But there's two.
There's you and there's Grandpa.

128
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:09,339
You know what?
Let's talk about something else.

129
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,466
Okay.

130
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,510
Will you read
Grandpa's new book?

131
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,180
Mom says you won't
because you're jealous.

132
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:21,768
Does your mother talk about anything
else, or is it just me 24 hours a day?

133
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,436
Shit!

134
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:26,606
This is like voodoo, your mother
knows where l am every second.

135
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,445
Get in!

136
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,323
lf l point to you,
make believe your neck hurts.

137
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,325
What are you, a moron?

138
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,286
I'm sorry.
This was my fault.

139
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:40,537
Did you see anything?

140
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,455
- l was talking to my son.
- Bullshit!

141
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:43,707
That's all right, sir.

142
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,334
It's our fault for
being in front of you.

143
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,003
No, really. Listen to me.

144
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,505
I'm responsible.
Here's my insurance information.

145
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,549
It's okay. Forget about it.

146
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,385
Forget about--?
Your rear end is screwed up.

147
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,721
No, it was like that before.

148
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,433
Let's call the police
and file a report.

149
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,685
Fuck the police.

150
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,145
Hear me?

151
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,898
Okay. Fuck them.

152
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,192
You're right. Fuck them.

153
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,863
Especially those mounted cops
who leave big piles all over...

154
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,407
...and you just step in it
up to your shins.

155
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,242
Let me give you my card...

156
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,078
...in case you look at the damage
and change your mind.

157
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,080
You a doctor?

158
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,457
I'm a psychiatrist.

159
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,918
Oh. A shrink.
I talked to a shrink one time.

160
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,546
When I got sent upstate on a...

161
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,131
...fishing trip.

162
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,592
Jelly! Let's go! Come on.

163
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,178
I gotta go.

164
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,263
I'll see you.

165
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,227
Pings and knocks.

166
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,480
Cheap gas.
What are you going to do?

167
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,857
-Right.
Take it easy, doc.

168
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,567
Right.

169
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,198
I bet you showed the other kids how

170
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,575
I can see the judge's eyes

171
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,661
When he handed you the prize

172
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,622
I bet you made the cutest bow

173
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,332
Neurotics only!

174
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:11,544
You must have been a beautiful baby

175
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:14,089
'Cause baby, look at you now

176
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:15,840
Thank God for Prozac

177
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:20,553
Baby, look at you now

178
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,767
You're not coming?
I mean, this is my wedding.

179
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:29,062
We understand it's
a special day for you, Benny...

180
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,648
...but your father and l can't just
pick up and leave town...

181
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,942
...every time you decide
to get married.

182
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,277
Every time?
This is a once in a lifetime--

183
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,738
Twice in a lifetime thing, Mom.

184
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,825
Dad, you're not coming
to my wedding?

185
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,120
We want to, but I have
three book signings next weekend.

186
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,622
I can't piss off
these big bookstores.

187
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:51,334
If l cancel, they stick me on
the bottom shelves. That's how they are.

188
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,836
That's the word on the street.

189
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,338
Barnes is okay, but Noble is
a vindictive prick.

190
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,132
Ben. The language.

191
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,633
I'm sorry, but listen.

192
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,177
I have been alone for eight years.

193
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:04,597
I finally found somebody that
I want to spend my life with.

194
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,142
At least meet her
before we get married.

195
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,018
You are gonna be her family.

196
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,229
I think she should
know that up front.

197
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,939
You're being very hostile.

198
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:14,983
I was joking.

199
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,068
I think I'll go talk to the mayor.

200
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,987
The mayor is here?

201
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,322
What's wrong?

202
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,074
Nothing. Everything's fine.

203
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,826
How's your practice?

204
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,036
Excellent.
I have interesting patients.

205
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,165
Very interesting.
Fascinating, actually.

206
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,001
Dad has a patient who
dreams he shits trout.

207
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:35,837
Thanks, Mike.

208
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,717
The Manetta family is bound
to ask questions.

209
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,053
They think we put
the hit out on Dominic.

210
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,347
Forget Dominic.
They were after Paul.

211
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,017
It's a miracle you survived.
I just thank God.

212
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,144
Yeah, thank God, all right.

213
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:54,439
If it wasn't because l had to
go back for that toothpick...

214
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,816
...l'd be lying dead with Dominic,
God forbid.

215
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,359
May he rest in peace.

216
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,028
This is about the big meeting.

217
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,530
Primo Sindone wants to
run the whole show.

218
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,282
Primo's a boss.
He knows the rules.

219
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:08,203
He couldn't come after them unless
he had permission from the families.

220
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,664
If they did, we're headed for
one big war, l can tell you that.

221
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,834
Find out what you can.
We got two weeks.

222
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,837
God forbid the other
New York bosses are against us.

223
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,301
I want to know that
before l go into that meeting.

224
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,844
Sure.

225
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,888
You all right?
You don't look too good.

226
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,058
What's the matter?

227
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,561
I'm a little choked up.
I'm going to get some air.

228
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,231
- Take it easy.
- Take some air.

229
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,616
Paul...

230
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,409
-...you all right?
-Yeah, I just...

231
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,203
What?

232
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:53,915
I feel like shit.

233
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,918
This whole thing is like
one big fucking headache.

234
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,462
You having one of them "mindgraines"?

235
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,218
Paul. Jimmy!

236
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,470
- Let's go for a ride.
- What's the matter?

237
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,722
- Just drive the car.
- What happened?

238
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:24,195
Good news, Mr. Evans.
Your heart is just fine.

239
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:25,780
"Just fine"?

240
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,117
But l had eight heart attacks
in the last three weeks.

241
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:32,120
Based on everything,
I'd say you had an anxiety attack.

242
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,454
A what?

243
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,331
An anxiety attack.
A panic attack.

244
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,624
I'll give you Xanax.

245
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,585
An anxiety attack?
What are you saying?

246
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,128
It's a common thing.

247
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,005
Hey, look at me.

248
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,507
Do I look like a guy who panics?

249
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,596
-Do l look like I panic?
-lt's nothing to be ashamed of.

250
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:53,224
Where'd you go to medical school?
I got a fucking heart attack.

251
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,019
Not according to your EKG.

252
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:10,325
Jelly, l need you to do
something for me as a friend.

253
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:11,492
Yeah, anything.

254
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,913
-l need you to find me a doctor.
-We just come from the doctor.

255
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,373
Not that kind of doctor.
Like a head doctor.

256
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,959
You going to change your face
like Sonny Black?

257
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,170
Don't get his nose.
He looks like a pig.

258
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,798
Not a plastic surgeon.
I got to spell everything out for you?

259
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,383
It saves time.

260
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:33,181
I mean, like a head doctor.
Like a psychiatrist.

261
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,515
Wow.

262
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:37,894
This is like one of them psychic,
ESPN...

263
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,605
...ESPN things, you know?

264
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:44,525
I just ran into a psychiatrist.
Actually, he ran into me.

265
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,278
-Was he any good?
-Yeah.

266
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,156
He seemed like a smart guy.
He had a business card.

267
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,534
A business card? Wow.
That's a real fucking achievement.

268
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,333
What do you need a shrink for?

269
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,418
It's not for me.
It's for my friend.

270
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,129
He has problems.
I'll ask the shrink questions...

271
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,090
...and get some answers
for my friend.

272
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,883
And nobody can know.
God forbid...

273
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,344
...somebody hears l been
talking to a shrink.

274
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:14,305
It could be interpreted wrong.
Know what l mean?

275
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,557
No one will ever know.

276
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,686
-Could I just ask one question?
-Go ahead.

277
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,437
This friend...

278
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:22,855
...is it me?

279
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,567
Yeah, it's you.

280
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:32,949
Carl, l'm detecting a pattern.
You settle too easily for things.

281
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,410
You're right. l do.

282
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,663
See, you just did it again.

283
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,749
I suggested something
and you immediately agreed.

284
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,210
You're right. l did.

285
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,753
Why do you do this?

286
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,422
I don't know.

287
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,925
I think it's your fear
of rejection or disapproval.

288
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,428
You don't have to worry about that.

289
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,471
Be your own man. Stand your ground.

290
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,349
You don't have to let people roll over you.

291
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,768
-Dr. Sobel?
-Excuse me, we're in session.

292
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,937
Yeah, l know. l'm sorry.

293
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,566
I know you.
You're the guy I hit last night.

294
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,693
Bingo. Get out of here.

295
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,612
Upsy-daisy. Got a coat, nutbar?

296
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,864
-What are you doing?
-He's leaving.

297
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,867
He's not going till
he's done with his session.

298
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,369
-l'll give you $1 00 to leave.
-Don't take it.

299
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,829
-Make it $1 50.
-Listen.

300
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,456
-Three hundred.
Carl.

301
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,332
He ain't that fucking crazy.

302
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,835
You were right. l stood my ground.

303
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,296
This was the wrong time.
-l got him up from $1 50.

304
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,256
-l'm proud of you.
-l feel like a new man.

305
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,674
I'm so happy.

306
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,053
I know you're upset about the car,
but you can't come in here.

307
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,305
This is a patient's private session.

308
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,684
You know me?

309
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,978
-Yes.
-No, you don't.

310
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,317
You see my picture in the paper?

311
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,985
-Yes.
-No, you didn't.

312
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,237
I don't even get the paper.

313
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,745
Jelly, wait outside.

314
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,456
Sit down.

315
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:11,255
-You ain't got no bugs in here?
-Bugs?

316
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:14,008
Bugs. Recording equipment.

317
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,844
No. I don't record. l take notes.

318
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:22,016
I tried to give him the insurance
information several times.

319
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,852
Seriously, several times.
He wouldn't take it.

320
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,854
Please don't kill me.

321
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,649
I was going to ask you
if you liked Tony Bennett.

322
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:33,528
I'm a big Tony Bennett fan.

323
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,781
-Me too.
-l like all ltalian singers.

324
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,243
Mr. Vitti,
I know it's not your fault...

325
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,246
...but shouldn't we take this up
with our insurance companies?

326
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,748
It ain't about that.
I don't care about the car.

327
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,042
I got a friend of mine....

328
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,213
He's got problems, and he'll
have to probably see a shrink.

329
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,173
So l'll ask you
a couple of questions.

330
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,300
Oh. Go ahead, then.

331
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,304
What do we do?
What, we sit?

332
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,265
Whatever makes you comfortable.

333
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,558
I'll sit over here.

334
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,228
I'm going to sit here.

335
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,605
If you're comfortable, it's fine.

336
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,156
So who starts?

337
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,409
Tell me why you think
you need therapy.

338
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:25,371
I don't need therapy.
I told you that. lt's for my friend.

339
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,331
-l'm sorry.
-You didn't hear me say that?

340
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,541
I'm sorry.

341
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:32,628
You're supposed to be good at listening.
You can't remember what l said?

342
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,046
So sorry.

343
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:37,800
I ain't thrilled with the level of service
up to this point.

344
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:41,304
-That was my fault. I apologize.
-Yeah.

345
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,931
Why don't we start over?

346
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,601
Why don't you just tell me
about your friend?

347
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:52,440
This friend, you know,
he's a very powerful guy.

348
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,317
Never had trouble
dealing with nothing.

349
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,861
All of a sudden, he's falling apart...

350
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,947
...he cries for no reason,
he can't sleep...

351
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,949
...he can't be with his friends.

352
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,535
All of a sudden,
he gets nervous around them.

353
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,370
He wants to get away from them.

354
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,582
And these are guys he knows
his whole life, you know?

355
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,709
And then he has these attacks.

356
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:16,005
He can't breathe, he gets dizzy...

357
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,549
...chest pains, you know....

358
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,469
He thinks he's gonna
die or something.

359
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,845
Panic attacks.

360
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,847
What's it with you guys
and panic attacks?

361
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,975
Who said "panic"?
Who said "panic"?

362
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,268
Not panic.

363
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,979
Dizzy, chest-breathing,
constricting...

364
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,981
...attacks.

365
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,860
This guy, he just wants to know
what he can do to make it stop.

366
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:43,741
Mr. Vitti,
I'm gonna go out on a limb here.

367
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,662
I think your friend...

368
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,039


369
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:58,381
You. You....

370
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,425
You got a gift, my friend.

371
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,761
You got a gift.

372
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,346
Oh, yeah.

373
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,307
You saw that there was something
I was trying to do...

374
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,060
...and figured it out.
That's why you are who you are.

375
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,479
God bless you.
You got a fucking gift.

376
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:17,400
-No, I don't.
-Yes, you do.

377
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,403
Go on.

378
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,697
-What?
-Go on.

379
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,156
I think...

380
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,701
...medication could help.

381
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,077
Drugs?

382
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,121
Can't do drugs.
I don't do drugs.

383
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,874
If you want to get to
the root of the problem...

384
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,876
...you'll want to get
some form of therapy.

385
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,087
Like what?
With you or something?

386
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:41,382
Me? No, l don't think you want--

387
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,343
My roster of patients is full.

388
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:48,097
I'm full right now.
Plus, l'm leaving on a short vacation.

389
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,598
Where you going?

390
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,976
-l don't share that with patients.
-Where?

391
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:54,770
Sheraton Bal Harbor Hotel
in Miami Beach.

392
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,522
That wasn't so hard, was it?

393
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,232
No, it wasn't.

394
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,946
You know, it's a funny
kind of a thing...

395
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,408
...but l feel better after
I got all that off my chest.

396
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,160
I feel like a load...

397
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,329
...a load is off my shoulders.

398
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,165
-You're good.
-l--

399
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,541
Doc, thank you.

400
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,336
-l didn't do anything.
-You did.

401
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:19,837
-l did nothing.
-You did too.

402
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,298
The load, gone. Where is it?

403
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,799
Don't know.

404
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,594
You're good. Nah, nah.

405
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,596
You're good, Doc.

406
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,890
I'll be getting in touch with you.

407
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,434
-Don't, please.
-One more thing.

408
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,436
If l talk to you...

409
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:39,440
...and you turn me into a fag,
I'll kill you. Understand?

410
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,151
Could we define "fag"?
Because some feelings...

411
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,653
-...may come up.
-l go fag, you die. Got it?

412
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,781
Simple.

413
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,199
You're good, Doc.

414
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,284
You're good.

415
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,830
-See you, Doc.
-Mm-hm.

416
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,970
We take on Manetta,
what does Vitti do? Nothing.

417
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,472
Why doesn't he move?

418
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,765
Fuck him.

419
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,768
You say "fuck him,"
but he's planning something big.

420
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,103
This shit's coming down.

421
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,146
Well then,
let it come down.

422
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:20,981
Let me tell you,
Vitti's a tough guy...

423
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:24,860
...but a lot of tough guys get fed to
the crabs off Red Hook.

424
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:28,697
Vitti. That name has been
haunting me since l was a kid.

425
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,826
Growing up, he was the smart guy,
I was the dope.

426
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:35,121
My father was a nickel-and-dime
shitheel, his had it all.

427
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,498
Vito Genovese blew it at Apalachin...

428
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,751
...because he forgot to kill
Gambino before the meeting.

429
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:43,879
I won't make that same mistake.
I want Paul Vitti dead!

430
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,716
You hear me? I want him dead.
Not breathing now. Dead!

431
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,844
Okay, okay, okay.

432
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,762
Like the pants?

433
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,597
They look great.
He's some tailor.

434
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,434
-l'll tell you. Look good.
-l like them.

435
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:04,775
Don't leave food in your room.
I won't come home to a science fair.

436
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,444
I didn't.

437
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,697
-Dad, one thing, though.
-Yeah?

438
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,282
-"l go fag, you die."
-That's it.

439
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,075
I'm sealing the vent
in your room.

440
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,035
You cannot listen to my sessions!

441
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,830
It's so cool.
Was that really Paul Vitti?

442
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:21,292
I didn't ask to see his
Mafia decoder ring, but it was him.

443
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:24,628
-Are you going to treat him?
-Of course not. Are you crazy?

444
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:29,049
And, Michael, you cannot tell anybody
that he was here. Understand?

445
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,051
-Should l take it off the lnternet?
-What?

446
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,928
-Michael!
-l'm kidding.

447
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,480
Despite the heat
and the popularity...

448
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,565
...of more exotic Caribbean destinations...

449
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:47,985
...Florida's hospitality industry
reports booming business...

450
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,945
...from Orlando to the Keys.

451
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,489
Judging from the mob...

452
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,032
...around the pool here today...

453
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:57,286
...there's nothing off about the off-season
in Miami Beach this summer.

454
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:01,790
On a personal note,
this is my last report for WVBF.

455
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,835
I'm marrying a wonderful man,
and l'm moving to New York.

456
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:06,754
Thanks for everything, Miami.

457
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:10,841
For the last time, this is
Laura MacNamara for WVBF.

458
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:13,594
Catch!

459
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,348
We're clear! Nice, Laura.

460
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,141
Okay.

461
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,685
-Ben!
-Hi.

462
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,484
Everybody! This is him!
This is the guy!

463
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:29,735
Hi.

464
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,363
-l missed you so much.
-l missed you too.

465
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,698
-Michael, say hi.
-Hi, Laura.

466
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:37,117
Hi, Michael. How are you?

467
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,912
You want to go
look at the camera?

468
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:42,289
Why would l want to go
look at the camera?

469
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:46,710
-Oh, yeah. ls it okay?
Yeah, go ahead.

470
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,130
Don't worry if you break anything.
I'm out of here.

471
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:54,802
-You think he likes me?
-He's crazy about you. No, he is.

472
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,096
I love you.
I'm so glad to be with you.

473
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,807
Do you really?
And do you really love me?

474
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,976
Of course. What's the matter?

475
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,562
-l'm nervous.
-Why?

476
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,648
Because I'm going to be
a stepmom to a grown kid...

477
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:09,233
...and we're getting married.

478
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,318
So, what are you worried about?

479
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,737
What if you get tired of me?

480
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:16,240
A lot of couples are very happy
and then they marry...

481
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,742
...and completely lose interest
in each other.

482
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,703
That won't happen to us.

483
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:37,761
Is everything okay, Paul?

484
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,598
Will you stop talking?
I'm trying to do this here.

485
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,726
You seem distracted.
-l am.

486
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,102
I got things on my mind.

487
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,521
-Would you stop talking?
-l'm sorry.

488
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:48,772
Lie down.

489
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,527
Thinking about your wife?

490
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:57,531
I wasn't thinking about my wife.
What are you talking about?

491
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,074
Sorry.

492
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,376
Now I am thinking about my wife.

493
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:12,338
Sheila, why can't you
keep your mouth shut?

494
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:14,048
Sorry.

495
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,721
Psst.

496
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,389
Dr. Sobel.

497
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,558
Psst.

498
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,226
Dr. Sobel.

499
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:30,147
-Mom?
-Dr. Sobel.

500
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:33,275
It's me.

501
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,236
Mr. Vitti wants to see you.
I got your robe.

502
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:42,701
l got news for you, you two-bit prick,
son-of-a-bitch rat bastard...

503
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,954
...you did nothing for me!
Whatever you did, it didn't take.

504
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,415
I'm still fucked up.
You did nothing for me!

505
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:52,002
I did nothing for you?
I saw you for five minutes.

506
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,545
What do you expect?

507
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:57,007
I can't work miracles.
Let me tell you something else.

508
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,677
I don't like it when someone
breaks in...

509
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:01,929
...and kidnaps me
in the middle of the night!

510
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,681
I have a family. I have a life.

511
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,599
And l have a serious practice.

512
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,352
And l don't have time for your bullshit!

513
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,271
That got away from me
at the end there.

514
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,026
I couldn't get it up last night.

515
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:18,487
Do you mean sexually?

516
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,531
I mean for the game
against Michigan State.

517
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,991
Of course, sexually!
What's the matter with you?

518
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,618
Can l get this straight?

519
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:28,205
You flew 1 500 miles,
you dragged me out of bed...

520
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,499
...because you couldn't get
an erection?

521
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,001
Don't that prove l'm motivated?

522
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,878
You can take a pill for that.

523
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,088
That's a cheat.

524
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:38,757
You start with the pills,
next it's hydraulics.

525
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,927
A hard-on should be gotten
legitimately or not at all.

526
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,887
I think Mark Twain said that.

527
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,973
Are you going to help me or not?

528
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,643
I don't believe this.
All right.

529
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,186
Okay.

530
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,688
Has this happened before?

531
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,441
-The dead dick thing?
-Mm-hm.

532
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:58,152
Never.
Well, one time. Last night.

533
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,196
-One more time.
-So twice.

534
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,198
Do the math. Two times.

535
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,244
Then another time, but after
a big meal, so that don't count.

536
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:10,414
Being unable to perform
three or four times is not--

537
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:11,832
Eight times.

538
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,126
Eight times is not catastrophic.

539
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,003
Maybe not to you. Look at you.

540
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,965
But if I can't get it up,
that makes me less of a man.

541
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,092
In my world, I deal with animals.

542
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:25,053
They may seem dumb to
an educated guy like you...

543
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:28,348
...but animals are very cunning
and they sense weakness.

544
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,392
I got less than two weeks...

545
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,187
...to get strong, or they'll eat me up,
if they don't kill me.

546
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:34,480
What happens in two weeks?

547
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,690
I can't tell you.
You don't want to know.

548
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:40,027
You can't tell me and I don't
want to know. That's a big help.

549
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,196
You're supposed to tell me.
I do want to know.

550
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,782
That's how this works.
This is impossible.

551
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:48,160
I can't do anything in two weeks,
and even if I could...

552
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:51,622
...what is my goal? To make you
a happy, well-adjusted gangster?

553
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:54,708
The other day I was watching
a TV commercial...

554
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,585
...some kid playing with puppies.

555
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,712
I cried for 45 minutes.

556
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,839
Slap a pair of tits on me, l'm a woman.

557
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,467
-l can't help you.
-You're turning me down?

558
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:07,888
When I got into family therapy,
this wasn't the family l had in mind.

559
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:12,518
You with your schmucky little office
and house, you're turning me down?

560
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:15,103
So you can listen to
housewives piss and moan...

561
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,439
...about nobody fucks them
right anymore? Eh?

562
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,024
-l'm leaving now.
-You see this?

563
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:22,069
This is what l'm talking about.

564
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:23,904
I'm a dead man.

565
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:29,576
You call yourself a doctor.
You should be ashamed of yourself.

566
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:35,415
A real doctor could never turn his back
on a person who's suffering!

567
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:40,796
You couldn't treat a fucking
two-celled amoeba, you fucking phony.

568
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:47,678
Mother of God, give me
the strength to get through this.

569
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:51,265
This fucking rat bastard
won't help me.

570
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:56,854
I start crying all the time.
Don't know what it is.

571
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:58,689
All right, here.

572
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:07,948
Sit down.

573
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,954
What happened with
your wife last night?

574
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,665
I wasn't with my wife.
I was with my girlfriend.

575
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,001
-Are you having marriage problems?
-No.

576
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,669
Why do you have a girlfriend?

577
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,421
You're moralizing with me now?

578
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,132
No, I'm curious.
Why do you have a girlfriend?

579
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,551
I do things with her
I can't do with my wife.

580
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,136
Why can't you do them with your wife?

581
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:32,681
That's the mouth she kisses
my kids with. Are you crazy?

582
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,852
Have you been under stress lately?

583
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:40,105
-Like seeing your best friend murdered?
-That would qualify.

584
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,732
I got a lot of stress.

585
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:49,197
Based upon what you told me before
about the attacks...

586
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,158
...l'd say that was probably it.

587
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,869
-Just stress?
-"Just stress"?

588
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,871
Stress is a very powerful force.

589
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,999
I doubt there's anything
physically wrong with you.

590
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,084
-That's it?
-That's it.

591
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,338
-That's it?
-l think so.

592
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:06,882
-You.
-No, no.

593
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,425
You're very good, you.

594
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:09,968
You are very good.

595
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,304
-There's more to it than--
-You're very good.

596
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,473
-There are underlying--
-Understand me?

597
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,099
You're right on the money.

598
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,852
I feel the juices rush back
to my balls as we speak.

599
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,563
I never thought l'd hear
another man say that to me.

600
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,941
That settles it.
You are my shrink.

601
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,692
No, I couldn't.

602
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:29,363
You're not ready to open up.
You're not a good candidate--

603
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:32,616
Listen to you.
The fucking honesty.

604
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,242
That's it. You don't understand.

605
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,703
Nobody, nobody talks to me like that.

606
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,330
You understand?

607
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:40,040
-Yes, I do.
-That's it.

608
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,375
Let's do it. l'm ready.

609
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,418
You don't hear the word "no" very often.

610
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,880
I hear it all the time,
only it's more, "No, please, no, no."

611
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,216
I'm here for two more days.

612
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:52,678
When I get back to New York,
I'll treat you exclusively.

613
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,680
For two weeks.

614
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:56,932
I just don't know what
to tell my patients.

615
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,892
-You want me to clear your schedule?
-Oh, no.

616
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,853
It would be my honor to do that.
My pleasure. Jimmy?

617
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,523
No. No, not Jimmy.
I will do this myself.

618
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:05,857
-You sure?
-Positive.

619
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,734
I will see you in New York.

620
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:10,904
Okay. Want one of them?

621
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,239
- No, thanks.
- Sure?

622
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,408
That's very kind of you, but l....

623
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:16,743
Want to give a little sta minch?

624
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,620
You sure?

625
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,956
The pause that refreshes.

626
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,916
I don't-- No, l really....

627
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,209
You're on vacation.

628
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,253
I'm also about to get married...

629
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,922
...so l'd like to go back
to my hotel and....

630
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,425
Good night.
I'll see you in New York.

631
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:34,594
You. Hey, Doc. You.

632
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,346
I'm going to see a lot of you.

633
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:40,267
Ben? Where were you?

634
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:42,436
My God, l woke up
and you were gone!

635
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:45,313
There was no note or anything!
I was out of my mind!

636
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,774
I walked all over the hotel
looking for you.

637
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:51,069
I even ate a Rice Krispy Treat.
I almost called the police.

638
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,156
No, don't call the police.
I'll tell you the truth.

639
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,283
I had a patient emergency.

640
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,577
You have patients in Florida?

641
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:02,456
One. He followed me from New York.
I had to go, trust me.

642
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,624
My God. Who is this patient?

643
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:10,338
Paul Vitti.

644
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:13,884
-Paul Vitti? Mafia Paul Vitti?
-Yeah.

645
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,969
Yes.

646
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:20,307
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

647
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,477
Listen. lt's not like
he's a regular patient.

648
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:25,645
-He's got problems.
-Well, yeah.

649
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:28,523
He thinks that l'm treating him.
It's crazy.

650
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:30,317
-So you're not treating him?
-No.

651
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:31,735
Tell me you're not.

652
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,153
I'm not treating him.

653
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,364
It's scary. You don't want
someone like that in your life.

654
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:39,451
I've covered the mob down here.
I've seen what they do.

655
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,788
He and l spoke about it.
He understood. lt's over.

656
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:45,123
-You're sure?
-Absolutely.

657
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,125
Okay.

658
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,002
I was so worried.

659
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,338
I thought maybe you got scared or...

660
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,006
...saw an ex-girlfriend
or something.

661
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,509
-Oh, no, no.
-Well, l don't know.

662
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:57,928
-l love you.
-l love you.

663
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:01,348
I'm sorry, but everything's
going to be okay.

664
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,685
It's such a good vibration

665
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:08,230
Give her a big hand! Let's hear it!
How about that?

666
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,733
Ooh, wow.

667
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,570
That was great!
Come on, get into it.

668
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,281
I don't understand.
They splash in the water.

669
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:19,699
They eat fish.

670
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,535
This is not a big stretch
for a whale.

671
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:22,744
Stop it.

672
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,038
We're having fun, right?

673
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:28,125
I'm not having as much fun
as it looks like l am.

674
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:31,128
I'm pretending, because we
have to bond and all.

675
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:41,388
As l was saying, a little snack
for her might be, oh, 50 pounds of mackerel.

676
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,057
There she goes!

677
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,564
I'm going to get a hot dog.
Anybody want anything?

678
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,274
-l'll go with you.
-No, it's fine.

679
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:55,318
You're pretending to have a good time.
I don't want to spoil that.

680
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,778
I'll be right back.

681
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:59,072
You think those whales
piss in that water?

682
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:03,285
I think they use the men's room
next door to the Burger King.

683
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:04,494
Dummy.

684
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,872
-What's going on?
-Mr. Vitti wants to see you.

685
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:09,708
-ls this a joke?
-You're an employee of Mr. Vitti's...

686
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:12,335
...which means you're on call
24 hours a day...

687
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,004
...just like the rest of us.

688
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,589
I'm sorry. He and l discussed--

689
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,925
We discussed this, and l agreed
to see him in New York.

690
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,093
That's it.

691
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:23,221
Dr. Momma-Luke, listen to me.
It is what it is.

692
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,891
If he wants you sooner,
you go sooner.

693
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:27,434
That's it. Yeah.

694
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,852
No. I am not going.

695
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:31,605
And if either one of you
bother me again...

696
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,273
...l won't treat him at all.

697
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,608
Do you understand that?

698
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,486
It's over! End of story.

699
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,531
Look at the size of this one.

700
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,950
Jesus Christ!

701
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:47,204
It's feeding time.

702
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,291
They threw me in
the shark tank, Paul.

703
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,084
They were trying to make a point.

704
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:55,337
That you're scary?
Believe me, l get it.

705
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:56,546
You're in a mood.

706
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:59,299
I get that way when
a shark tries to chew on my ass.

707
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:02,219
-We had an agreement.
-We did, but I had an episode.

708
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:05,430
I didn't have a panic attack,
but I started panicking...

709
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,641
...thinking I might get one.
Is that weird?

710
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,602
I am redefining "weird"
on an hourly basis.

711
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,562
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

712
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:15,190
-He's talking with some guy.
Can you hit him?

713
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:18,526
He's got fat Jelly and
his partner Jimmy Boots with him.

714
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:21,780
I could do it with a rifle and scope,
but I don't have that with me.

715
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:22,989
Just get him.

716
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,325
You told me to take care of him,
I'll do it.

717
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,661
What were you thinking
when you got anxious?

718
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:30,163
Let's get out of here.
We're being watched.

719
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:33,166
Don't look.
There's feds up there watching us.

720
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,126
How do you know that?

721
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,962
I'm a criminal. lt's my job.

722
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:40,173
Who's the new face?

723
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,426
Maybe he's Vitti's new consigliere.

724
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,721
Whoever this guy is,
he must be important to the family.

725
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,683
Put his picture on the wire,
see what you come up with.

726
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:58,191
Normally, a patient wouldn't have
a vat of Scotch during a session.

727
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:03,863
That's interesting. l'll have to
remember it if l'm ever on Jeopardy.

728
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:05,407
Tell me about your father.

729
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:08,243
My father. Well, my father....

730
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,953
Let's sit here.

731
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:11,997
My father.

732
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,792
A big man in the neighborhood.
Everybody loved him.

733
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,919
Very well-respected, God rest his soul.

734
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,629
He passed away?

735
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,799
I just like saying "God rest his soul."
Of course he passed away.

736
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,718
I was about 1 2 at the time.

737
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:26,219
How did he die?

738
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,888
It was a sudden thing.
A heart attack.

739
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:31,474
How was the relationship?
Were you close?

740
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:32,976
Eh, we were pretty close.

741
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,437
We weren't getting along great
right then.

742
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:37,147
Why is that?

743
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,941
I was hanging out in the neighborhood.
I had a borgata.

744
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,401
What is that?

745
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:44,070
A kid gang, nothing big.
But he didn't like that.

746
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,488
-He didn't approve.
-No, no.

747
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,991
He slapped me around
a couple of times.

748
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,492
And what?

749
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:50,994
And then he died.

750
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,413
How'd that make you feel?

751
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:56,124
It felt great, wonderful.
How'd it make me feel?

752
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,417
Think about it.

753
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:00,795
Were you angry?
Were you afraid? Sad?

754
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,964
Maybe all those things.

755
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,758
Any feelings of guilt?

756
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,301
About what? I didn't kill him.

757
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,178
I know that,
I'm just speculating...

758
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:12,349
...that maybe in some way
you may have wanted him to die.

759
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,017
Why would l want him to die?

760
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:17,145
You said you were fighting.
He slapped you around...

761
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,564
...because you rebelled
against his authority.

762
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,608
Maybe some unresolved
Oedipal conflict.

763
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,443
English, English.

764
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:27,530
Oedipus was a Greek king who killed
his father and married his mother.

765
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:28,823
Fucking Greeks.

766
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:31,326
It's an instinctual developmental drive.

767
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,661
The young boy wants to
replace his father...

768
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,289
...so that he can
totally possess his mother.

769
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,792
Are you saying
I wanted to fuck my mother?

770
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:42,003
-lt's a primal fantasy.
-Have you ever seen my mother?

771
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,464
-Are you out of your mind?
-lt's Freud!

772
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,509
Freud's a sick fuck, and you are
too for bringing it up.

773
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,636
-lt's--
-Ugh!

774
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:54,516
Can l be honest?
I don't think l can call you Dad.

775
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,477
So, what do l call you?
Do I call you Scott?

776
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,354
My friends call me Captain.

777
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:01,815
-Captain?
-Yeah, Captain.

778
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,483
Captain.

779
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,944
Want another drink?
I'm definitely having eight or nine.

780
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,987
I'd like a morphine and soda.

781
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,073
I'm shaking.

782
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,827
Shall we go to our table?
Come on, Michael.

783
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:15,412
Hey. Hey.

784
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:16,871
Señor Sobel.

785
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:21,501
How you doing?

786
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,671
Honey, it's the Vittis.

787
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,881
My God. Yeah.

788
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:31,302
Everybody's happy,
everybody's smiling. This is nice.

789
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,346
You Paul Vitti, the mobster.

790
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,225
Now, is that polite? Eh?

791
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:39,727
Is that being nice?
I'm trying to be nice.

792
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,897
Do I walk up to you and say
you're so-and-so, the hard-on?

793
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:46,067
This is Laura's father,
the captain.

794
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,069
I'm very, very sorry.

795
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,404
Excuse us.

796
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,950
I heard about the wedding.
Here you go.

797
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,454
A little something for
the bride and groom. God bless.

798
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:58,955
We can't accept this.

799
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,832
-Yes, you can.
-Thank you.

800
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,419
I'm just going to borrow this guy.
I'll bring him right back.

801
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,379
And then you'll leave us alone.

802
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:09,466
I'll leave you alone.
I got to talk to you.

803
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,969
Two minutes.
Two minutes.

804
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:15,763
Wait over there.
Don't listen to what we say.

805
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,432
My ears are sealed.

806
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,559
I had a really weird dream
last night.

807
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:22,729
I feel like I'm having one now.
Why'd you interrupt my party?

808
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:25,482
You're really very rigid
about certain things.

809
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,025
Did you know that?

810
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:29,569
All right,
tell me about your dream.

811
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,362
I'm asleep.

812
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:34,199
I hear a baby crying.
I go to the refrigerator.

813
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,992
I get him a bottle of milk.

814
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:37,994
I bring the bottle of milk to him...

815
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,537
...l see the milk is black.

816
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,373
That's fucking weird!
-Get out of here.

817
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,250
-Get out of here.
-Sorry.

818
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:48,421
What does that mean?
And no more filth about my mother.

819
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,548
I don't know.
What does it mean to you?

820
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:54,594
This is why I pay you? I say
something, you say it back to me?

821
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:57,055
I could get Jelly to
do that for nothing.

822
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:59,807
Get Jelly.
I'm going back to my party.

823
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,937
All right.
I'm letting it go this time.

824
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:07,232
Because you're getting married,
I'm going to let it go.

825
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:13,905
Why don't you look over that way
before l bust your fucking head open?

826
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,448
Jesus.

827
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:32,131
I'm going to grab a bite to eat.
You want a sandwich?

828
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,801
What kind of sandwich
ain't too fattening?

829
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,594
A half a sandwich.

830
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:39,055
I'll be back in a few minutes.

831
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:12,505
Now, nod your head and smile.
Do it.

832
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:15,174
Now, you listen to me, goombah.

833
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:18,386
I know what your game is,
and you'd better call it quits.

834
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:22,181
If you and your paisans
do anything to hurt my little girl...

835
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,017
...l don't care who
your friends are...

836
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:27,687
...l'll hunt you down like
the dog you are, and I'll kill you.

837
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,272
Understand?

838
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,232
Now, nod and smile.

839
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,026
Congratulations.

840
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:37,864
What was that about?

841
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:41,784
Just guy stuff between
me and the captain.

842
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:48,351
Shit!

843
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,773
In sickness and in health,
from this day forth...

844
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,942
-...as long as you both shall live?
-l--

845
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:04,701
Ey-ey-ey-ey-ey.

846
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:07,829
Bring Marie and
the kids right to the airport.

847
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:11,791
Pull the car in the back of the hotel
and wait for us.

848
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,042
You got it, boss.

849
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,878
That's it. That is it.
I have had it with you.

850
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:17,130
-What happened?
-What happened?

851
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:21,217
I just saw a man fall seven stories
into a platter of poached salmon!

852
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:23,302
Did he break anything?
-Everything!

853
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:25,179
They're still pulling capers
out of him.

854
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:29,225
People get depressed, they jump.
It's a tragedy, but it ain't my fault.

855
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,060
You're telling me it was a suicide?

856
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,813
I think he left a note.
Jelly, did they find it?

857
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,940
No, but they will in a minute.

858
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,276
"Life is bullshit.

859
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:40,820
I can't fucking take it no more.
Signed, the dead guy."

860
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,947
Hey. That's good, Doc.

861
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:45,408
Enough talk.
We got to get out of here.

862
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:47,201
There's feds all over.

863
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,287
I'm going back to New York...

864
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:52,290
...and l would suggest that
you do the same thing.

865
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:54,292
Because they're probably
on to you too.

866
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,544
On to me?
What are you talking about?

867
00:45:56,754 --> 00:46:00,214
Being an accessory to a murder
wasn't part of our understanding.

868
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,133
I didn't kill nobody.

869
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:04,177
I can't speak for
other people in the room.

870
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:05,511
That guy tried to kill me.

871
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:08,347
God forbid he did that
to somebody in my family.

872
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:10,850
It would've been
a double or a triple tragedy.

873
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:13,394
Trust me, in this case,
we're the good guys.

874
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,104
Where is he?

875
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:18,149
Where are you going?
-Don't touch me.

876
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,693
How could you do that?

877
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:22,779
Another country heard from.

878
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,363
Wait downstairs.

879
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:27,742
Why? Are they going to throw me
off the balcony too?

880
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:30,870
You're upset and
you're upsetting me.

881
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:32,163
Of course I'm upset!

882
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:35,708
My wedding is ruined
because you've got problems!

883
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:36,959
I got problems?

884
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:38,586
Honey, please.

885
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:42,381
I'm going to pack,
and then l'm going to New York.

886
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:45,551
And l am getting married with you
or without you!

887
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,346
With! With! l'm sorry, honey.

888
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:51,891
It'll all work out. l promise.
Please?

889
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:54,477
No, I hate you!

890
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,147
Are you happy? Huh?
Are you happy?

891
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:00,650
You know what you did?
You have ruined my life!

892
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:02,735
Happy?
What are you talking about?

893
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:05,238
You think I wanted this?
I'm a victim here.

894
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:06,864
I can't believe this guy.

895
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:09,325
He tries to kill me,
then whacks one of my guys.

896
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:13,079
On top of that, he fucks up your wedding.
You know how upset I am?

897
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:15,998
I'm so enraged, I don't know
what do to with myself!

898
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:18,751
Plus, l'm trying to
get out of this hotel and--

899
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,586
Are you listening to yourself?

900
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:21,963
Listen to yourself!

901
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:26,384
This has been a disaster from the moment
you stepped foot in my office.

902
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:29,262
That is it. Over!
I'm no longer your doctor.

903
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:30,847
Just because of this?

904
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:34,225
Because of this little double homicide?
Yes, because of this!

905
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:37,937
You don't have a shred
of human decency. Not a shred.

906
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:40,106
I actually thought I could help you.

907
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:42,859
There's no helping you.
You're a common thug!

908
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:44,694
Nobody in the world could help you!

909
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:46,445
All right!
What do you want me to do?

910
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:51,826
Yo.

911
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:54,287
Let me speak to Primo.
-Hold on.

912
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:58,416
Paul Vitti's on the phone.

913
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:01,627
-Vitti?
-Vitti.

914
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,759
-Hello.
-Yeah, yeah, hello.

915
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:10,219
Who is this?
-lt's me.

916
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:12,555
-Me who?
-Me who-- Me, me.

917
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:15,433
-Me, me who?
-Me, me. You know me. Me.

918
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:17,393
Yeah, how's it going?

919
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:18,811
Not good. Not good.

920
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:21,981
Whoever did that thing to
you-know-who, my good friend...

921
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,649
...they're trying to do that to me.

922
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:26,277
And l'm having a lot
of feelings about that.

923
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:28,988
And l'm trying to get some...

924
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,324
-Closure.
-...closure on that.

925
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,952
What kind of feelings?

926
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:37,872
I'm very angry.
I'm feeling very angry about that.

927
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,582
I'm really, uh--

928
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:40,917
I'm enraged.

929
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:43,336
I'm feeling very,
very mad about that.

930
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:44,837
Why are you telling me?

931
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,464
Why am l telling you?

932
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:48,841
Like you don't know
nothing about it? Eh?

933
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,343
You don't know nothing?
What?

934
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:52,678
I don't know what
you're talking about.

935
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,513
-l'm trying to....
-Tell you how I feel.

936
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:57,224
Tell you about my feelings
and that....

937
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:58,976
-l'm angry.
-l'm angry.

938
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:00,561
And anger is a....

939
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,521
-A blocked wish.
-A blocked wish.

940
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:06,025
And l'm looking forward to seeing
you next week at that thing...

941
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,819
...then l can unblock
that angered wish...

942
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:10,029
...and then hopefully....

943
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,698
You make one more move on me,
you motherfucker...

944
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:14,867
...l'll fucking cut
your fucking balls off!

945
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:18,454
I'll shove them up your fucking ass,
I'll fucking bury you!

946
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:21,707
I'll put ice picks in your eyes!
I'll chop your eyeballs!

947
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:24,710
I'll send them to your family
to eat for dessert!

948
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:26,879
-You understand me?
-Hey, Paul.

949
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:28,381
-What?
-Fuck you.

950
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,383
You motherfucker!

951
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:36,222
You get a dictionary and find out
what this "closure" is.

952
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:40,559
If that's what he's going to hit us
with, l want to know what it is.

953
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:42,186
How was that?

954
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:44,480
It was going great until...

955
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,441
...the cutting off of the balls
and shoving it up...

956
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:48,901
...his ass.

957
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:52,405
You know what l do when l'm mad?
I hit a pillow.

958
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:54,323
Just hit the pillow.
See how you feel.

959
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:01,122
There's your fucking pillow.

960
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:03,916
Feel better?

961
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:06,502
Yeah, l do.

962
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,004
Good.

963
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:25,438
Call the Vatican.
See if something is missing.

964
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:27,815
So cool!

965
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,902
Michael, I need to talk to your dad
in private, okay?

966
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:33,904
Would you unload the car, please?

967
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:36,907
It's almost as tall as the house.

968
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:39,952
-Mike?
-All right.

969
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,787
What is going on?

970
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:43,622
What is this?

971
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:45,916
Why?

972
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:49,128
It's a wedding gift.
He felt bad for the--

973
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:53,340
Mm-hm, okay. Well, we're not married,
so we can just send it back.

974
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:58,137
It was not my fault.
Everybody was there.

975
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:01,098
You didn't want to
go ahead with the ceremony.

976
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:05,269
What did you expect? That's not what
I want for an anniversary memory.

977
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:08,856
"Look at our wedding video.
There are your parents, and mine.

978
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:11,317
There's the guy that plunged to his death."

979
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:13,736
I just want to marry you.

980
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:16,155
I'm thinking it'll never happen.

981
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:19,241
It's happening next Saturday
at the Waldorf.

982
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:20,659
And who will be there?

983
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:22,244
The three of us, the clergyman...

984
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:25,956
...and any of your family who
are done with their crisis counseling.

985
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:28,709
No guests without necks.
Everybody has to have a neck.

986
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:32,171
-We will do a neck check at the door.
-Thank you.

987
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:35,800
Any furniture you want
to change in the house--

988
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:38,594
Dr. Sobel.

989
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:39,845
Ma'am.

990
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:42,765
I'm Agent Steadman.
Agent Ricci, Agent Provano...

991
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:44,892
...Federal Bureau
of lnvestigation, OCD.

992
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:46,977
Obsessive-compulsive disorder?

993
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:50,147
Organized Crime Division.
We need to talk.

994
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,691
FBI? This is cooler
than the fountain.

995
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:53,984
Go to your room.

996
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,028
-But l just--
-Go to your room.

997
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,864
Fine. l can hear
better in there anyway.

998
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,200
Please.

999
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:07,706
Can you explain these photographs?

1000
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,921
Hm.

1001
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:19,051
Yes. l'm a psychotherapist.
Paul Vitti is my patient.

1002
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,928
-Was your patient.
-Was my patient.

1003
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,055
But not even like a patient.

1004
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:24,390
Right. Exactly.

1005
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,684
So why did he send you
that fountain?

1006
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,395
The fountain?

1007
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:32,314
Oh, that. That was a....

1008
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:36,527
That was a gift to
celebrate the completion...

1009
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:38,070
...of the therapy.

1010
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:40,447
I got a television
from a kleptomaniac...

1011
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:43,075
...so it's not really
that big of a deal.

1012
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:45,536
Let me cut to the chase,
Dr. Sobel.

1013
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:50,249
Sometime in the next week,
the heads of every major crime family...

1014
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,793
...are meeting somewhere
in the New York area.

1015
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:55,754
We think the stage is set
for a major bloodbath.

1016
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:57,339
Has he mentioned it to you?

1017
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:59,592
A bloodbath?

1018
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:03,095
No. He has not mentioned
anything like that.

1019
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:05,431
I would've remembered that.

1020
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,767
"Bloodbath" is something that
sticks out in a conversation.

1021
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:12,855
You could really help us by supplying
information about that meeting.

1022
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,691
If l don't?

1023
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:17,693
If you don't...

1024
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:20,738
...l will personally
make your life a living hell.

1025
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:27,745
Pauly, I don't mean this
in a disrespectful way.

1026
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:31,332
Now, you know I was
a good friend to your father.

1027
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:34,543
I'll always be
a good friend to you.

1028
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:38,255
But the word is out
that you're talking to a shrink.

1029
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:40,716
-ls that right?
-What's the point here?

1030
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:44,553
The point is this concerns
the whole family.

1031
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:47,806
Right now, we're the only ones
that know about it.

1032
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:50,893
If this ever gets out in the street,
we're dead.

1033
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:52,978
Who knows what
you're saying to him?

1034
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:55,731
It ain't nobody's fucking business.

1035
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,191
I beg to differ.

1036
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:01,320
If you're looking to establish
an insanity plea for later on...

1037
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:02,988
...that's okay.

1038
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:06,533
But everybody'll think you're
falling apart. lt's not right.

1039
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:08,994
They'll think
this is a sign of weakness.

1040
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:12,331
Sindone will take over everything.
Is that what you want?

1041
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:14,625
So, what do you want me to do?

1042
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,293
It's time to end it, Paul.

1043
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:17,836
What do you mean, end it?

1044
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:20,339
Get rid of the shrink.
He knows too much.

1045
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,883
You want me to whack my doctor?
Are you crazy?

1046
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:27,012
Paul, if you don't do it,
somebody else will.

1047
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,056
That's the way it is.

1048
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:30,891
Nobody touches this guy.

1049
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:34,353
Anybody lays a finger on him,
I'll kill them. Understood?

1050
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:42,194
-l'm getting fruit. Want anything?
-No, I'll wait in the car.

1051
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:50,953
Can l get two of these?

1052
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:26,739
Papa!

1053
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:32,119
Papa! Papa!

1054
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,713
Papa!

1055
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,428
I'm sorry.

1056
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:51,180
Sorry.

1057
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:01,774
You look lousy.
You all right?

1058
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:06,028
Yeah, l'm all right.
Listen, Paul, don't send me any more gifts.

1059
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:10,616
-You didn't like the fountain?
-lt's a boundary issue.

1060
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:13,702
If more people gave from the heart,
we'd all be better off.

1061
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:17,289
Let me see your watch.
Piece ofjunk. You're getting a Rolex.

1062
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:20,167
-Don't buy me one.
-Who said anything about buying?

1063
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:22,711
Paul, listen.
I really have to talk to you.

1064
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:33,972
Who is that?

1065
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:39,061
Tommy Angels. We grew up together.
Worked for a crew out of Jersey City.

1066
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:42,648
-How did he die?
All rise.

1067
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:46,318
He was on his way to talk
to a federal prosecutor.

1068
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,404
Got hit by a truck.

1069
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:50,280
Twice.

1070
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:52,199
I don't need to know this.

1071
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:53,659
I can't hear this.

1072
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:57,830
This is too much for me.
I'm having nightmares myself.

1073
00:56:57,997 --> 00:57:01,125
The other night, l dreamed you and I
were walking down the street...

1074
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:02,835
...and l stopped to buy some fruit.

1075
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:05,587
Out of nowhere, two guys
come and they kill me...

1076
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:09,007
...like Marlon Brando
in The Godfather.

1077
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,511
Good scene. What'd l do?

1078
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:13,846
You drop your gun.

1079
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:17,558
You run up to me and you
yell, "Papa! Papa!"

1080
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:19,351
I was Fredo?

1081
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:21,395
I don't think so.

1082
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:25,732
You're starting to lose it.
You may need therapy yourself.

1083
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:29,528
-Paul, we really have to talk. This is--
All rise.

1084
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:32,531
We're running out of time.

1085
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,301
The widow.

1086
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,136
I'm very sorry.

1087
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:56,555
The daughter.

1088
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:57,973
I'm sorry.

1089
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:03,937
-Brother.
-My condolences.

1090
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:11,403
I'm very sorry.

1091
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,839
Him I don't know.

1092
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:37,804
Can we talk now?

1093
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:46,104
Don't you see? You
called me Papa. This is all about your father.

1094
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:48,148
You're nuts. That's your dream.

1095
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:50,484
But the black-milk dream
is also about your father.

1096
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:53,695
I don't buy that. ln my dream,
I'm bringing the baby the black milk.

1097
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:56,323
Freud believed you're everyone
in your dreams.

1098
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,450
Fuck Freud.
After what you told me...

1099
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:01,203
...l'm afraid to call
my mother on the telephone.

1100
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:03,622
Listen, just try to go with me here.

1101
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:05,958
Let's just say that you are the baby.

1102
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,960
What kind of milk did
your father bring you?

1103
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:09,628
Could we stop talking about
my father?

1104
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:13,507
No. That's the point.
We have to talk about your father.

1105
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:16,009
It is so hard to--
You know what you're like?

1106
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,178
"Doc, you got to help me.

1107
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:19,972
I'm in pain.
Please help me."

1108
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:22,975
"All right, Paul, I'll help."
"Fuck you. Nobody helps Paul Vitti."

1109
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:27,729
"Oh. That's interesting.
What does that mean to you?

1110
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:29,648
Anger is a blocked wish."

1111
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:31,900
Boo-fucking-hoo-hoo.

1112
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,194
-Let's talk about your father.
-Let's not.

1113
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:35,654
What does your father do?

1114
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:36,947
It's not important.

1115
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:39,241
-What? You paused.
-l did not.

1116
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:42,494
You just paused. That means you
had a feeling. A thought.

1117
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:44,663
What does your father do?
What's he do?

1118
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:47,249
-He's a psychiatrist.
-A psychiatrist?

1119
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,167
Oh.

1120
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:52,004
Now I know why you're fucked up.
Next patient, please.

1121
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:53,672
We are running out of time.

1122
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,841
Let's not waste it on my problems.

1123
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:57,175
-Your father's a problem?
-No.

1124
00:59:57,343 --> 00:59:58,343
-That's what you said.
-l did not!

1125
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,762
-Now you're upset.
-l am not upset!

1126
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:02,097
-Yes, you are.
-Stop it!

1127
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:03,557
I'm getting good at this.

1128
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:07,853
Paul, we only have a few days left.
This is very important stuff.

1129
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:10,105
That's why you're acting like this.

1130
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,357
If you want to spend it
screwing around, l can't help you.

1131
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:14,776
Call me when you want
to get serious.

1132
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:16,570
I am serious.

1133
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:19,031
Hey. Don't you want to
analyze me no more?

1134
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:21,450
Doc, doc, doc.

1135
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:22,868
Say hello to your father for me.

1136
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:30,876
lt's time to end it, Paul.

1137
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:32,544
What do you mean, end it?

1138
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:35,213
Get rid of the shrink.
He knows too much already.

1139
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:36,923
You want me to whack my doctor?

1140
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:40,969
Ifyou don't do it,
somebody else will. That's the way it is.

1141
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:42,429
Nobody touches this guy.

1142
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:45,223
Anybody lays a finger on him,
I'm gonna kill them.

1143
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:47,059
Understood?

1144
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:49,645
Now let's hear the other one.

1145
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:52,230
You want me to whack my doctor?

1146
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:55,567
Ifyou don't do it,
somebody else will. That's the way it is.

1147
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:57,611
I'm gonna kill them.

1148
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:01,323
-Good.
-That's very good.

1149
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:04,201
We think it's time to end it.

1150
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:05,452
What do you mean?

1151
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:08,538
Get rid of the shrink.
He knows too much already.

1152
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:10,248
You want me to whack my doctor?

1153
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:13,752
Ifyou don't do it,
somebody else will. That's the way it is.

1154
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,462
I'm gonna kill them.

1155
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:21,551
What do you want me to do?

1156
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:26,973
Paul, he's talking to the feds.

1157
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:29,935
I know this guy. He wouldn't
talk to the feds. No way.

1158
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:33,939
The FBI was over at his house today.
Jimmy Boots saw them.

1159
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:36,775
You saw them there?
-lt's the truth. l saw them.

1160
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:38,527
Next, you'll get a call...

1161
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:40,696
...and he'll want a meeting.

1162
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:42,447
Hey, Paul.

1163
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:44,408
Dr. Sobel called.

1164
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:47,077
He said he needs to see you
right away.

1165
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:53,375
If our lips should meet

1166
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:56,878
Innamorata

1167
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:58,547
This is delicious.

1168
01:01:58,756 --> 01:02:00,215
This is so good.

1169
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:02,134
I love ltalian food.

1170
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:04,761
I've never been to Italy. Is it great?

1171
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:06,555
I was in France twice...

1172
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:09,683
...and Jamaica, the island.
You ever been there?

1173
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:11,852
It's great,
because l love to snorkel.

1174
01:02:12,019 --> 01:02:15,147
Have you guys ever snorkeled?
It's great to sleep with the fish.

1175
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:17,399
Swim with the fish.
Have you ever done that?

1176
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,568
It's good. So...

1177
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:22,154
...what are you doing this summer?

1178
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:24,030
About what?

1179
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:27,242
-Hey, Carlo.
-How are you?

1180
01:02:28,786 --> 01:02:30,996
-Jelly. Good.
-How you doing?

1181
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:33,999
This is Ben. Say hello to Carlo.

1182
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:36,042
-Carlo. Carlo...?
-How you doing?

1183
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,462
That's it. Grab a seat.

1184
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:43,508
Carlo and I grew up together.

1185
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,719
He's like, I would say, almost...

1186
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:47,846
...like a cousin to me.

1187
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:50,390
-l am your cousin.
-That's what I'm saying.

1188
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,684
It's a family thing.
It's the closeness.

1189
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:55,896
Anything he needs, anything I can
do for him, l'm here for him.

1190
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:57,439
-You know that.
-l know.

1191
01:02:57,648 --> 01:02:59,441
Did you take care of that thing?

1192
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:03,403
-lt's all right to talk business?
-lt's okay.

1193
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:05,113
-l took care of it.
-And the other?

1194
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:08,450
I got to wait for the first
before l can move on the second.

1195
01:03:08,659 --> 01:03:10,285
The guy give you a problem?

1196
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:13,371
The guy in the first thing?
He's a lunatic.

1197
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:15,207
-What did he say?
-The usual.

1198
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:16,958
You told him you weren't doing it?

1199
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:18,293
What am l going to do?

1200
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,295
Got to nip that shit in the bud.

1201
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:23,089
But if the first comes through,
that'll fix everything.

1202
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:26,176
Including the second thing.
Exactly.

1203
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:29,554
Don't repeat what you hear here.
You hear?

1204
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:31,973
The first thing
or the second thing?

1205
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:33,225
Very funny.

1206
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:35,310
Stevie Beef is over there.

1207
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:38,897
-Fat piece of shit.
-Rat-fucking, cocksucking....

1208
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:41,650
-Scumbag.
-Garbage pail.

1209
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:43,068
Let's go say hi.

1210
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:47,614
Hey, Steve, how are you?

1211
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:52,619
So this is a very unusual place.
Do you guys come here often?

1212
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:56,581
Well, this place has
a very special meaning for Paul.

1213
01:03:56,749 --> 01:03:58,542
Yeah, it's where his father
got whacked.

1214
01:03:58,709 --> 01:04:00,252
Hey.

1215
01:04:00,878 --> 01:04:03,338
- What's the big secret?
- Never mind.

1216
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:05,048
Wait a second.

1217
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:08,593
Paul's father was murdered?

1218
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:11,263
Right at that table,
with his whole family there.

1219
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:13,431
Shut your face.

1220
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:19,563
Paul was there too.

1221
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:22,190
He doesn't like to talk about it.

1222
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:30,532
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where you going?

1223
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:31,950
To the bathroom.

1224
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:33,743
Sit down.

1225
01:04:33,911 --> 01:04:35,453
I'm going with you.

1226
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:45,088
Jelly, l have to, you know....

1227
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:47,674
-Poop?
-Yeah.

1228
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:49,634
Go ahead.

1229
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:13,992
Holy shit!

1230
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:20,165
You got to get more roughage, Doc.

1231
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:21,416
Wow!

1232
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:23,376
A bran muffin in the morning
would help that.

1233
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:27,255
I don't believe this.

1234
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:29,841
I'd like to see a movie,
but there's nothing out there.

1235
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:33,219
It's all this shoot-them-up
action bullshit.

1236
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:35,972
I get enough of that at work.

1237
01:05:36,557 --> 01:05:39,267
Primo, that was our friend.

1238
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:41,519
They spotted that guy
at Paretti's Restaurant.

1239
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:43,313
That's good.

1240
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:44,981
That's very good.

1241
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:47,275
Handsome Jack.

1242
01:05:47,693 --> 01:05:49,611
Let's make it his last supper.

1243
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:51,988
-You got it, Primo.
-No problem.

1244
01:05:52,156 --> 01:05:55,450
Hey, Jack. Just for fun...

1245
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:57,702
...tear out his heart and bring it to me.

1246
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:00,956
I'm going to bring it back to you
on a fucking platter.

1247
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:02,707
Where we going to get a platter?

1248
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:04,459
Just bring it, all right?

1249
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:07,462
Or Raisin Bran. That goes
right through me.

1250
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:09,547
-lt's a pusher.
-Good tip.

1251
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:12,676
I have to talk to you.
In private.

1252
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:19,724
Why didn't you tell me
about your father?

1253
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:20,892
What about him?

1254
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:23,061
You told me he died
of a heart attack.

1255
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:26,481
-What's the problem?
-Your father was murdered.

1256
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:29,317
What's the difference? He's dead.

1257
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:32,445
It's a big difference.
Why didn't you tell me?

1258
01:06:32,613 --> 01:06:35,323
It's private. I got to tell you
every little thing?

1259
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:36,950
This is not a little thing.

1260
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:39,452
What am I going to do?
Spend my life crying about the past?

1261
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:40,912
It's over. Forget it.

1262
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,081
I think you want to talk about it.

1263
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:45,208
-l don't want to talk about it.
-You do.

1264
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:47,168
I don't want to talk about it.

1265
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:49,754
-Why did you choose this restaurant?
-l like it.

1266
01:06:49,922 --> 01:06:51,923
Of all the places we could've gone,
why this place?

1267
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:53,216
White clam sauce. The best.

1268
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:57,095
That's not the reason.
You want me to know about your father.

1269
01:06:57,263 --> 01:07:00,098
-You're reaching out to me.
-Yeah, I'm reaching out to you.

1270
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:02,475
Where is it?

1271
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:13,611
Get in the car.

1272
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:18,450
It's late. I'll take a cab.
I can get to Grand Central and....

1273
01:07:18,617 --> 01:07:20,535
You know what?
I can make the 1 1 :1 0.

1274
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:22,120
So thanks, anyway.

1275
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:24,456
I said get in the car, Doc.

1276
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,834
Do what he says.

1277
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:32,547
You know, this is called a "transference
neurosis," where the patient--

1278
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:35,967
Okay.

1279
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:37,552
Get in the car.
-Yeah.

1280
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:05,830
What is this guy doing? He's been
in the bathroom for half an hour.

1281
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:09,250
-Oh, fuck!
-Get over there!

1282
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:19,511
Son of a bitch!

1283
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:22,764
We lost him.

1284
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:53,128
Come on, get out.

1285
01:08:53,337 --> 01:08:54,879
Get out and get over there.

1286
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:01,261
All right, leave us alone.

1287
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:04,013
Sorry, Doc.

1288
01:09:04,181 --> 01:09:05,557
It's not personal.

1289
01:09:05,724 --> 01:09:09,435
Don't kid yourself.
It doesn't get more personal than this.

1290
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:14,941
Walk over there.

1291
01:09:20,197 --> 01:09:22,490
-You know why I got to do this?
-Yes. Do you?

1292
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:25,535
Don't bullshit me.
You ratted me out, you betrayed me.

1293
01:09:25,744 --> 01:09:28,663
I betrayed you? That's interesting.
Who's got the gun?

1294
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:31,499
Don't give me that.
Are you insulting my intelligence?

1295
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:33,251
You cooperated with the feds.

1296
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:36,671
They played me a tape. I heard you
say you were going to kill me.

1297
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:39,340
-l heard the tape.
-Never. On my mother's life.

1298
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:40,592
-Never.
-l heard it.

1299
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:43,344
It's not important now,
but I did not betray you.

1300
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:46,222
I had a wire on, but l took it off
because l think l can help you.

1301
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:49,601
-l don't want to know what you think.
-Yes, you do.

1302
01:09:49,768 --> 01:09:51,186
Let me help you!

1303
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:53,104
It's over!

1304
01:09:56,775 --> 01:09:58,651
Can l ask you one last question?

1305
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:01,529
What?

1306
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:03,114
-What did you order?
-What?

1307
01:10:03,282 --> 01:10:04,949
-What did you order?
-When?

1308
01:10:05,117 --> 01:10:07,827
The night your father was killed,
what were you eating?

1309
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:10,205
How the fuck do l know?

1310
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:11,581
You don't remember?

1311
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:13,082
It was 35 years ago.

1312
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:14,626
What was your father eating?

1313
01:10:14,793 --> 01:10:17,128
I don't remember.
What are you talking about?

1314
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:18,796
Try.

1315
01:10:18,964 --> 01:10:22,550
It's a simple question.
What was your father eating?

1316
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:34,145
Penne.

1317
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:36,064
Good.

1318
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:38,274
What did you have?

1319
01:10:42,154 --> 01:10:43,947
Ravioli.

1320
01:10:44,823 --> 01:10:47,367
The food was already on the table?

1321
01:10:47,534 --> 01:10:49,786
No, they were serving it.

1322
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:52,956
And did you see the guys coming?

1323
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:56,167
One of them.

1324
01:10:57,544 --> 01:10:59,337
Dressed like a busboy.

1325
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:02,382
Your father saw him too?

1326
01:11:03,175 --> 01:11:06,302
No. I knew the guy looked wrong.

1327
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:07,845
Why, Paul?

1328
01:11:08,013 --> 01:11:11,140
The pants.
Looked too good for a busboy.

1329
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:14,310
So he walked to the table.

1330
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,437
I watched him the whole way.

1331
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:18,314
Did you say anything?

1332
01:11:21,026 --> 01:11:22,777
No.

1333
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:26,906
Dad was so mad at me,
I couldn't say anything.

1334
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:29,117
And you were mad at him.

1335
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:32,161
And then what happened?

1336
01:11:32,329 --> 01:11:35,665
I never saw the second guy.
My mother just started screaming.

1337
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:38,334
And you blame yourself.

1338
01:11:38,502 --> 01:11:40,962
I could've saved him.

1339
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:42,547
But you were mad at him.

1340
01:11:42,756 --> 01:11:44,549
I should've said something.

1341
01:11:44,758 --> 01:11:46,801
You couldn't have saved him, Paul.

1342
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:49,137
I killed him.

1343
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:51,222
You didn't kill him.

1344
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:54,434
You were mad, but you didn't kill him.
It's the life he chose.

1345
01:11:54,601 --> 01:11:57,312
I just let him die.

1346
01:11:58,188 --> 01:12:00,690
I let him die!

1347
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:09,198
I let him die, and I couldn't
say goodbye to him.

1348
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:12,577
So why don't you say it now?

1349
01:12:12,786 --> 01:12:15,038
Tell him. If he was here,
what would you say?

1350
01:12:15,205 --> 01:12:16,581
-l can't.
-Yes, you can.

1351
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:19,000
I can't. No, I can't.

1352
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:20,418
Tell him, Paul.

1353
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:23,379
I want to say l'm....

1354
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:26,090
Dad, I'm sorry.

1355
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:29,677
I'm sorry.

1356
01:12:31,096 --> 01:12:34,057
I'm sorry, Dad.

1357
01:12:34,224 --> 01:12:36,768
I'm sorry. I let him die.

1358
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:40,605
I'm sorry, Dad.

1359
01:12:43,233 --> 01:12:44,817
Jesus.

1360
01:12:45,402 --> 01:12:47,445
Poor guy's falling apart.

1361
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:49,280
Why don't he just pop him?

1362
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:52,450
It's embarrassing
standing here like this.

1363
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:53,785
Shut up.

1364
01:13:02,002 --> 01:13:03,211
You couldn't save him.

1365
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:04,962
I know l could've. l could've.

1366
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:07,215
No, he was trying to save you.

1367
01:13:07,424 --> 01:13:09,175
That's what you fought about.

1368
01:13:09,426 --> 01:13:13,012
He didn't want this for you.
And you don't want it for Anthony.

1369
01:13:13,263 --> 01:13:14,430
No, I don't!

1370
01:13:14,598 --> 01:13:17,809
You don't want him to grow up
like you did, without a father.

1371
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:26,067
Your father's not dead, Paul.

1372
01:13:26,276 --> 01:13:29,821
He's alive in you.
And he's trying to tell you something.

1373
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:31,322
He's trying to tell you--

1374
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:33,074
Holy shit!

1375
01:13:34,993 --> 01:13:37,578
They're shooting! They're shooting!

1376
01:13:43,168 --> 01:13:45,711
-Pull yourself together!
-l feel so bad!

1377
01:13:46,004 --> 01:13:48,464
You're going to feel a lot worse.

1378
01:13:50,342 --> 01:13:51,926
Paul, come on!

1379
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:55,430
Time to channel all this nice grief...

1380
01:13:55,597 --> 01:13:56,931
...into a murderous rage.

1381
01:13:59,017 --> 01:14:00,560
Come on! Time to shoot back!

1382
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:03,020
Let's go! Here we go!
Bang, bang!

1383
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:06,649
Bang, bang! Come on. Let's go.

1384
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:09,068
Come on! Bang, bang!

1385
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:11,112
Now come on. Paul, here.

1386
01:14:11,321 --> 01:14:13,781
Put the gun in your hand and shoot!

1387
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:16,534
For God sakes, shoot somebody!

1388
01:14:18,829 --> 01:14:20,663
Give me the fucking gun!

1389
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:40,391
Stay down.

1390
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:43,478
Paul, you okay?

1391
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:44,979
Yeah, l'm okay.

1392
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:47,857
Jelly. Jelly, did l do that?

1393
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,734
No, Doc.

1394
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:51,110
That one's mine.

1395
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:53,070
You get the '72 Chevy...

1396
01:14:53,238 --> 01:14:56,908
...and the Amana side-by-side
refrigerator-freezer.

1397
01:14:57,075 --> 01:14:58,326
You okay, Paul?

1398
01:14:58,494 --> 01:14:59,911
Yeah, l'm okay.

1399
01:15:00,078 --> 01:15:01,913
I'm going to check on Jimmy.

1400
01:15:03,081 --> 01:15:04,373
Jimmy?

1401
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:11,422
Pretty fucking ironic, ain't it?

1402
01:15:12,716 --> 01:15:14,717
You can give me back the gun now.

1403
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:18,471
It's okay. I wasn't really
going to whack you.

1404
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:22,099
All right, maybe l was
going to whack you.

1405
01:15:22,267 --> 01:15:25,019
But l was real conflicted about it.

1406
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:27,021
Progress, right?

1407
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:34,987
I can't see you anymore.

1408
01:15:35,155 --> 01:15:36,739
I know.

1409
01:15:39,159 --> 01:15:41,077
You hit some very big stuff tonight.

1410
01:15:41,245 --> 01:15:44,121
So you'll probably
feel like this for a while.

1411
01:15:44,289 --> 01:15:46,165
But you're close to something.

1412
01:15:47,084 --> 01:15:48,543
The rest is up to you.

1413
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:51,212
Good luck.

1414
01:15:59,304 --> 01:16:01,639
I want to please him
when we're in bed...

1415
01:16:01,848 --> 01:16:05,351
...but whatever l do, it seems
like it's never enough.

1416
01:16:05,686 --> 01:16:08,980
Now he wants me to
say things when we're making love.

1417
01:16:12,943 --> 01:16:15,570
What kind of things
does he want you to say?

1418
01:16:15,737 --> 01:16:20,491
Well, he wants me to call him "big boy"...

1419
01:16:21,535 --> 01:16:24,036
...and he's my "bucking bronco"...

1420
01:16:24,871 --> 01:16:26,998
...and l'm supposed
to "ride him hard"...

1421
01:16:27,207 --> 01:16:30,710
...and "put him back
in the barn wet."

1422
01:16:41,179 --> 01:16:42,555
Are you okay, Dr. Sobel?

1423
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:45,474
Well, it's....

1424
01:16:48,186 --> 01:16:51,314
Here's what l think
you should do, Elaine.

1425
01:16:51,481 --> 01:16:54,317
I would do whatever he says.

1426
01:16:54,484 --> 01:16:56,944
If he wants you to talk, talk.

1427
01:16:57,154 --> 01:16:58,904
I'd get on all fours
and bark like a dog.

1428
01:16:59,156 --> 01:17:00,448
I'd do whatever it takes.

1429
01:17:00,657 --> 01:17:02,992
Smoke some joints,
drink wine, whatever it is...

1430
01:17:03,201 --> 01:17:05,369
...to get off on each other
and be happy.

1431
01:17:05,537 --> 01:17:06,787
Where are you running?

1432
01:17:06,997 --> 01:17:08,831
This is a time to be happy!

1433
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:11,542
Because life is just too short.

1434
01:17:11,752 --> 01:17:15,087
It's just too fucking short.

1435
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:17,673
Okay.

1436
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:25,514
I'll see you Thursday.

1437
01:17:30,687 --> 01:17:32,271
Everything okay?

1438
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:34,982
-Paul.
-Jelly.

1439
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:36,484
Feeling all right?

1440
01:17:36,693 --> 01:17:38,110
You need anything?

1441
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,280
No. Feel great. Never felt better.

1442
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:46,035
Wait'll l go to that meeting.
I'm going to knock them dead.

1443
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:49,038
All right. l'll be outside.

1444
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:56,837
When l look at him...

1445
01:17:57,005 --> 01:17:59,548
...I think about
how different it was.

1446
01:17:59,716 --> 01:18:02,426
Was providing for a family
simpler back then...

1447
01:18:02,636 --> 01:18:05,429
...or did he just make it
look that way?

1448
01:18:08,642 --> 01:18:10,726
Decisions are tougher now.

1449
01:18:10,977 --> 01:18:12,436
There's so much information...

1450
01:18:12,646 --> 01:18:15,064
...so many ways to invest.

1451
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:24,490
Strange. l spent the first half
of my life...

1452
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,951
...not wanting to walk
in his footsteps.

1453
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:29,370
Now I only wish l could.

1454
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:34,625
Times are more complex.

1455
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:37,837
Ask a Merrill Lynch financial
consultant who can help with a plan.

1456
01:18:38,046 --> 01:18:41,674
And more ways to make
the plan work than anyone else.

1457
01:18:52,811 --> 01:18:54,520
You look beautiful, honey.

1458
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:09,410
We are put on this earth
to find a love, a soul mate...

1459
01:19:09,619 --> 01:19:12,496
...someone with whom
we can create joy.

1460
01:19:12,706 --> 01:19:13,873
And how glad we are...

1461
01:19:14,082 --> 01:19:15,833
...that Ben and Laura
have found each other.

1462
01:19:16,042 --> 01:19:19,295
And we anticipate and celebrate
the years ofjoy...

1463
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:22,465
Psst. Psst.
-...they will share together from this day on.

1464
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:26,552
Ben, do you take Laura to be
your wedded wife...

1465
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:28,846
...for richer or poorer,
in sickness and in health...

1466
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:31,265
-...till death do you part, so help you God?
Psst.

1467
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:32,516
-No!
-What?

1468
01:19:32,684 --> 01:19:33,893
Excuse me?

1469
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:36,228
I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to him.

1470
01:19:36,396 --> 01:19:37,730
Who him?

1471
01:19:37,898 --> 01:19:39,190
It's not important. Yes.

1472
01:19:39,566 --> 01:19:40,649
Yes what?

1473
01:19:40,859 --> 01:19:42,777
Yes to the first part. To her.

1474
01:19:42,986 --> 01:19:45,029
That's a yes. Pick it up from there.

1475
01:19:45,655 --> 01:19:47,531
Doc, this is an emergency.

1476
01:19:47,741 --> 01:19:49,784
-l don't believe this.
-This is my wedding!

1477
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:51,952
-Want me to make a scene?
-Bigger than this?

1478
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:54,038
-Yeah.
-Jesus!

1479
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:56,707
Tick-tock. Let's go.
Hurry up. Pronounce.

1480
01:19:56,917 --> 01:19:59,960
By the power vested in me,
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1481
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:02,338
Ring, ring. Kiss, kiss.

1482
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:06,383
Here. Fine. Good.
Okay, just go.

1483
01:20:06,551 --> 01:20:08,886
Sorry, Mrs. Sobel. Duty calls.

1484
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:11,680
You're the first person to
call me Mrs. Sobel.

1485
01:20:11,848 --> 01:20:14,099
-Nice, huh?
-No.

1486
01:20:23,735 --> 01:20:25,903
l'm telling you, Doc,
this is serious.

1487
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:28,280
If he don't make that meeting,
they'll kill him.

1488
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:30,574
Can't somebody else
in the family go for him?

1489
01:20:30,867 --> 01:20:33,994
What about Tommy the Tongue
or Louie the Lip?

1490
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:35,955
What about you? Why don't you go?

1491
01:20:36,122 --> 01:20:39,416
That would be a very good idea,
except for one little detail.

1492
01:20:39,584 --> 01:20:42,628
I'm a fucking moron.
I'm known for it.

1493
01:20:42,796 --> 01:20:44,880
-You got to go.
-You must be a moron.

1494
01:20:45,048 --> 01:20:46,632
-Watch it!
-You just said it.

1495
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:50,094
When I say it, it's different.
When you say it, it sounds negative.

1496
01:20:50,262 --> 01:20:52,596
Jelly, l am not going to any meeting.

1497
01:20:52,764 --> 01:20:55,266
I am no longer on the payroll.
Do you understand that?

1498
01:20:55,433 --> 01:20:58,060
Now, l am going back to my wife.

1499
01:20:58,228 --> 01:21:02,106
-Doc.
-Jelly, don't--

1500
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:04,650
Now, Jelly,
we've been through this before.

1501
01:21:04,901 --> 01:21:06,318
You can't shoot me.

1502
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:10,948
It was Mr. Vitti who couldn't shoot you.

1503
01:21:12,576 --> 01:21:14,743
You're going to that meeting.

1504
01:21:19,082 --> 01:21:22,543
This is Surveillance 6. They've left
the building and are heading east.

1505
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:24,420
Roger that.

1506
01:21:27,507 --> 01:21:28,966
Put this on.
-ls this chrome?

1507
01:21:29,175 --> 01:21:30,593
I can see my own reflection.

1508
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:34,263
Let me tell you something.
That's a $1 ,200 Valentino suit.

1509
01:21:34,431 --> 01:21:38,017
If you spill anything on it,
I'm going to mess you up good.

1510
01:21:38,268 --> 01:21:40,519
Shut up! You're making him nervous.

1511
01:21:40,770 --> 01:21:42,980
If he fucks up,
they'll kill him for sure.

1512
01:21:43,148 --> 01:21:45,858
-What? This is insane!
-lt's all right.

1513
01:21:46,109 --> 01:21:48,861
Let's go over it again.
Mr. Vitti's been detained.

1514
01:21:49,112 --> 01:21:51,822
Apologies all around.
Ba-da-beep, ba-da-bop, ba-da-boop.

1515
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:54,617
And then you say
you're the new consigliere...

1516
01:21:54,826 --> 01:21:57,536
-...speaking for Mr. Vitti.
-Then what?

1517
01:21:57,746 --> 01:22:01,373
Then you keep your mouth shut
and hope nobody asks you nothing.

1518
01:22:01,541 --> 01:22:03,500
That's some plan you got there.

1519
01:22:03,668 --> 01:22:07,212
Shut up! Doc, if you got to talk...

1520
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:09,715
...try to be vague.
Could you do that?

1521
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:12,760
I'm a psychiatrist.
Believe me, l can be vague.

1522
01:22:15,722 --> 01:22:18,307
Looks like they're headed for the tunnel.

1523
01:22:20,226 --> 01:22:23,312
We'll pick them up on the other side.

1524
01:22:27,901 --> 01:22:29,401
Here they come.

1525
01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:34,323
Which one is it?

1526
01:22:34,491 --> 01:22:36,200
The black one.

1527
01:22:48,338 --> 01:22:50,631
Are you sure you don't want
something to eat?

1528
01:22:52,425 --> 01:22:54,343
You want some iced tea?

1529
01:22:55,845 --> 01:22:58,055
I think I'm going to call
Dr. Terragrossa.

1530
01:22:58,223 --> 01:23:00,224
Is Daddy going to be all right?

1531
01:23:01,726 --> 01:23:03,519
I think so, honey.

1532
01:23:03,895 --> 01:23:06,397
Shouldn't you be outside playing?

1533
01:23:06,564 --> 01:23:08,649
No, it's all right.

1534
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:11,610
How long you going to sit there?

1535
01:23:11,778 --> 01:23:13,988
How long you going to lay there?

1536
01:23:18,034 --> 01:23:19,702
I'm done.

1537
01:23:57,282 --> 01:23:58,866
Let's go.

1538
01:24:00,618 --> 01:24:02,077
It'll be all right, Doc.

1539
01:24:17,761 --> 01:24:20,179
There's no way I can get away with this.

1540
01:24:20,597 --> 01:24:22,097
Jelly, l can't do this!

1541
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:24,016
Don't fucking whine.

1542
01:24:24,267 --> 01:24:26,518
Whining's a dead giveaway.

1543
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:28,228
Blend.

1544
01:24:28,396 --> 01:24:29,813
Blend in.

1545
01:24:29,981 --> 01:24:31,607
Oh.

1546
01:24:31,775 --> 01:24:34,985
-Hey.
-Hey.

1547
01:24:35,153 --> 01:24:36,612
Oh.

1548
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:38,614
So where's Vitti?

1549
01:24:38,782 --> 01:24:41,533
He ain't here.

1550
01:24:41,701 --> 01:24:43,660
-How you doing?
-How you doing?

1551
01:24:43,828 --> 01:24:45,954
How you been? All right?

1552
01:24:46,122 --> 01:24:47,664
All right.

1553
01:24:47,832 --> 01:24:50,000
Hey, when'd you guys get out?

1554
01:24:50,168 --> 01:24:52,169
You need anything, you let me know.

1555
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:56,173
Whoa. Hey, ee. Hey, eye, oh.

1556
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:01,845
Hey. Easter weekend.

1557
01:25:03,515 --> 01:25:04,890
You're a planet!

1558
01:25:08,812 --> 01:25:10,521
Blending, enough.

1559
01:25:13,358 --> 01:25:15,025
Who's the guy with Jelly?

1560
01:25:15,193 --> 01:25:16,902
I never seen him before.

1561
01:25:22,492 --> 01:25:25,911
Hey. What's going on? Where's Paul?

1562
01:25:26,079 --> 01:25:27,704
He'll be here. Don't worry.

1563
01:25:27,872 --> 01:25:30,541
And what's he doing here?

1564
01:25:30,708 --> 01:25:32,042
He's just....

1565
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:34,545
It's okay. Forget about it.

1566
01:25:34,712 --> 01:25:36,171
Forget about it?

1567
01:25:36,339 --> 01:25:38,841
What the hell is that?
"Forget about it."

1568
01:25:39,008 --> 01:25:42,219
I can't do this. No, l can't do this.

1569
01:25:43,054 --> 01:25:45,180
I think we're going to get started here.

1570
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:47,808
We got a lot to talk about
here today, and...

1571
01:25:48,017 --> 01:25:51,061
...for now, we'll just stick
with the more important issues.

1572
01:25:51,229 --> 01:25:54,398
And one more thing.
If you got anything to say...

1573
01:25:54,607 --> 01:25:57,734
...let us know who you are, because
a lot of us don't know each other.

1574
01:25:57,944 --> 01:26:01,780
I didn't think anybody here was
into wearing fucking nametags.

1575
01:26:11,249 --> 01:26:12,958
I'm Primo Sindone.

1576
01:26:13,209 --> 01:26:15,127
They call me Sonny Long.

1577
01:26:15,378 --> 01:26:17,796
Some of you know me
as Mikey Gaga.

1578
01:26:18,047 --> 01:26:19,923
Some of you know me
as Joey Boombots.

1579
01:26:20,133 --> 01:26:23,886
Be as it may, it's good to see
so many of the old faces here...

1580
01:26:24,053 --> 01:26:26,930
...and to welcome some of the new ones
from all over the country.

1581
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:29,600
I see Joe Baldassare...

1582
01:26:29,767 --> 01:26:30,893
...Frankie Zello.

1583
01:26:32,437 --> 01:26:36,315
But l'm disappointed the head of
our other New York family isn't here.

1584
01:26:37,066 --> 01:26:40,694
All I see is his man Jelly
and some sawed-off prick nobody knows.

1585
01:26:45,617 --> 01:26:48,619
Yeah. Well, uh....

1586
01:26:48,786 --> 01:26:50,621
The thing is...

1587
01:26:50,788 --> 01:26:53,957
...Mr. Vitti's been detained.

1588
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:56,960
Plus, he's sorry...

1589
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:58,462
...for his detainment.

1590
01:26:58,713 --> 01:27:00,047
Detained?

1591
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:02,007
What kind of bullshit is that?

1592
01:27:02,175 --> 01:27:04,134
What's more important than this?

1593
01:27:04,344 --> 01:27:08,138
As the host, l take his not being here
as a sign of disrespect to me...

1594
01:27:08,306 --> 01:27:11,850
...and all these other men
who came a long way to be here.

1595
01:27:12,018 --> 01:27:14,561
Yeah. l mean, no. l mean--

1596
01:27:14,771 --> 01:27:17,397
You see, the thing is that
he's not feeling well.

1597
01:27:17,607 --> 01:27:20,984
-Plus, he don't feel good.
-Jelly.

1598
01:27:21,945 --> 01:27:23,528
What's the matter with you?

1599
01:27:23,696 --> 01:27:25,989
We never discuss Mr. Vitti's health
outside the family.

1600
01:27:26,157 --> 01:27:27,991
You know better than that.

1601
01:27:28,409 --> 01:27:30,244
Sit down.

1602
01:27:30,411 --> 01:27:32,287
Sit down!

1603
01:27:32,455 --> 01:27:34,581
You want a fresh one?

1604
01:27:37,377 --> 01:27:40,337
Who is this guy?
What the fuck is he doing here?

1605
01:27:40,546 --> 01:27:41,588
Who I am?

1606
01:27:41,798 --> 01:27:43,674
"Who l am?" "Who am I?"

1607
01:27:43,841 --> 01:27:45,676
"Who am I?" is a question
for the ages.

1608
01:27:45,843 --> 01:27:48,679
That's one we're all searching for,
to find out who I am.

1609
01:27:48,846 --> 01:27:51,014
Who's in there, who wants

1610
01:27:51,182 --> 01:27:52,516
"Hey, l'm hungry."

1611
01:27:52,892 --> 01:27:54,393
"Who l am"...

1612
01:27:54,727 --> 01:27:56,853
...is too deep and....

1613
01:27:57,146 --> 01:27:59,106
You got to go in deep
and pull out the thing...

1614
01:27:59,315 --> 01:28:02,192
...like that movie where the thing
came out of the stomach...

1615
01:28:02,402 --> 01:28:04,653
...and ate the people on
the fucking spaceship.

1616
01:28:04,862 --> 01:28:06,405
May they rest in peace.

1617
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:08,532
My name is Ben Sobel.

1618
01:28:09,909 --> 01:28:11,034
Leone.

1619
01:28:11,202 --> 01:28:12,577
Ben Soboleone.

1620
01:28:12,912 --> 01:28:14,579
I'm also known...

1621
01:28:14,872 --> 01:28:18,667
...as Benny the Groin,
Sammy the Schnoz...

1622
01:28:18,876 --> 01:28:21,253
...Elmer the Fudd,
Tubby the Tuba...

1623
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:24,006
...and once as
Miss Phyllis Levine.

1624
01:28:24,215 --> 01:28:26,258
But that was at a party.
It was years ago.

1625
01:28:26,509 --> 01:28:28,802
I smoked a titibet,
and l had a Quaquaalude...

1626
01:28:29,012 --> 01:28:31,722
...and suddenly l'm in fishnets
singing show tunes.

1627
01:28:31,931 --> 01:28:34,266
These things happen,
but has nothing to do...

1628
01:28:34,517 --> 01:28:37,227
...with what l'm here
with you fine gentlemen today.

1629
01:28:37,437 --> 01:28:38,562
So l apologize.

1630
01:28:38,771 --> 01:28:42,733
That being said, l'm also known to
the people who know me the best...

1631
01:28:42,942 --> 01:28:44,985
...as the fucking Doctor.

1632
01:28:45,528 --> 01:28:49,656
The second part of your question
that you asked me...

1633
01:28:49,866 --> 01:28:53,076
...is "Why am I here?"
I am here...

1634
01:28:53,745 --> 01:28:57,039
...representing Mr. Paul Vitti
as his consigligliere.

1635
01:28:59,125 --> 01:29:00,834
Consigliere.

1636
01:29:03,796 --> 01:29:06,381
Never correct me in public again.

1637
01:29:06,591 --> 01:29:08,425
Do you understand that?

1638
01:29:09,927 --> 01:29:11,762
You broke my heart, Jelly.

1639
01:29:11,929 --> 01:29:14,014
You broke my heart.

1640
01:29:16,642 --> 01:29:19,853
I apologize for
the second interruption.

1641
01:29:21,397 --> 01:29:23,315
As Mr. Vitti's...

1642
01:29:23,608 --> 01:29:26,318
...consigliere...

1643
01:29:26,944 --> 01:29:30,405
...l am involved in all aspects
of the Vitti family business...

1644
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:33,116
...and am prepared to speak
for Mr. Vitti on all matters.

1645
01:29:33,409 --> 01:29:35,452
Badda-bing-badda-boom-Betty Boop.

1646
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:37,746
Okay, Doctor.

1647
01:29:37,955 --> 01:29:39,790
Let's stop with the bullshit.

1648
01:29:42,668 --> 01:29:44,586
There's been this thing
between me...

1649
01:29:44,796 --> 01:29:46,421
...and Paul Vitti for a long time.

1650
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:51,176
Are you talking about the first thing
or the second thing?

1651
01:29:51,594 --> 01:29:53,637
What second thing?
I only know one thing.

1652
01:29:54,597 --> 01:29:58,141
How can we bring up the first
if we don't talk about the second?

1653
01:29:58,351 --> 01:30:01,103
-Did you talk to the guy?
-What guy?

1654
01:30:01,938 --> 01:30:03,647
The guy with the thing!

1655
01:30:03,856 --> 01:30:05,774
What thing?
What are you talking about?

1656
01:30:05,983 --> 01:30:07,984
How should I know?
You brought it up!

1657
01:30:08,194 --> 01:30:10,153
This is the problem.
Do you see this?

1658
01:30:10,321 --> 01:30:11,988
You see what's happening here?

1659
01:30:12,198 --> 01:30:15,867
You can't have an intelligent
conversation with this guy.

1660
01:30:18,037 --> 01:30:21,373
What if I put two bullets in your brain?
What do you think of that?

1661
01:30:21,624 --> 01:30:24,167
That's a little dark.
What do you think?

1662
01:30:24,377 --> 01:30:28,338
It's a good idea. Why would l say
it if l didn't think it was good?

1663
01:30:28,506 --> 01:30:29,673
I don't know. Why would you?

1664
01:30:31,008 --> 01:30:33,844
-l wouldn't! That's what I'm saying!
-Whoa, hoa, hoa.

1665
01:30:34,011 --> 01:30:37,180
Look at what's happening here.
Look at you.

1666
01:30:37,807 --> 01:30:41,518
Do you feel you have to get angry
so people will listen to you?

1667
01:30:41,686 --> 01:30:44,146
-ls that your deal?
-What is he saying?

1668
01:30:44,355 --> 01:30:46,940
You do have a tendency
to get angry a lot.

1669
01:30:47,150 --> 01:30:48,650
I agree, Primo.

1670
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:51,403
Talk about Vitti.
Why are we talking about me?

1671
01:30:51,571 --> 01:30:53,655
Oh! That's interesting too.

1672
01:30:53,906 --> 01:30:58,493
Do you feel you're not important
enough for us to discuss you?

1673
01:30:58,703 --> 01:31:00,412
-What does that mean?
-What do you think?

1674
01:31:00,663 --> 01:31:03,707
-Fuck you!
-Primo, calm down.

1675
01:31:03,916 --> 01:31:06,168
This prick won't stop
with the questions.

1676
01:31:06,335 --> 01:31:08,503
-Pass the fruit, please.
-You're a dead man!

1677
01:31:09,797 --> 01:31:12,466
Primo! Primo!

1678
01:31:13,926 --> 01:31:17,721
Put it down.

1679
01:31:23,853 --> 01:31:25,645
Wait in the car. Keep it running.

1680
01:31:25,813 --> 01:31:27,230
How are you feeling?

1681
01:31:27,398 --> 01:31:28,899
Sit down. l'll take it from here.

1682
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:31,693
Sit down. Sit down.

1683
01:31:33,404 --> 01:31:35,238
I'm Paul Vitti.

1684
01:31:35,406 --> 01:31:39,743
I'm sorry I was late. Those who know me
know l meant no disrespect.

1685
01:31:39,911 --> 01:31:41,703
If it's all right with you...

1686
01:31:41,954 --> 01:31:45,332
...l just want to say something.
Then l'll leave you to your business.

1687
01:31:45,541 --> 01:31:50,462
About two and a half weeks ago, somebody
killed my dear friend, Dominic Manetta.

1688
01:31:51,422 --> 01:31:52,923
Come on, this is bullshit.

1689
01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:56,218
Everybody knows he whacked out Dominic
so he could take over.

1690
01:31:56,385 --> 01:31:57,802
Whatever.

1691
01:31:57,970 --> 01:32:02,849
What l came to say is I've come to
a very important decision in my life.

1692
01:32:03,017 --> 01:32:04,434
And that is...

1693
01:32:05,394 --> 01:32:06,978
...l want out.

1694
01:32:07,146 --> 01:32:09,105
I don't want to do this no more.

1695
01:32:10,608 --> 01:32:12,609
I'm going to go away for a while...

1696
01:32:12,777 --> 01:32:15,946
...but l will respect the oath
I took the day l was made...

1697
01:32:16,113 --> 01:32:19,616
...and what I know about anybody's
business l take to the grave.

1698
01:32:19,784 --> 01:32:21,493
You have my word.

1699
01:32:22,495 --> 01:32:24,996
As for my own family...

1700
01:32:25,164 --> 01:32:28,250
...l know Carlo Mangano would
like to be the new boss.

1701
01:32:28,459 --> 01:32:29,668
Thank you, Paul.

1702
01:32:29,835 --> 01:32:32,128
That's why he betrayed Dominic
and me to our enemies...

1703
01:32:32,296 --> 01:32:34,756
...and sent his own man
to Miami to try and kill me.

1704
01:32:34,966 --> 01:32:37,801
-l swear you got this wrong--
-Shut your mouth.

1705
01:32:38,803 --> 01:32:41,054
Even though it's my right,
I won't take revenge.

1706
01:32:41,222 --> 01:32:43,890
You want to know why?
Because you got a problem.

1707
01:32:44,058 --> 01:32:45,809
A problem with aggression.

1708
01:32:45,977 --> 01:32:47,686
Maybe you weren't hugged as a kid.

1709
01:32:47,937 --> 01:32:49,771
You ought to look inside yourself...

1710
01:32:49,981 --> 01:32:53,608
...look inside
and find out who you are.

1711
01:32:53,776 --> 01:32:55,485
Because for me...

1712
01:32:55,653 --> 01:32:56,987
...l had a breakthrough.

1713
01:32:57,154 --> 01:33:01,324
I'm in a good place mentally,
and l'm feeling good about me.

1714
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:04,744
I don't know, Paul.

1715
01:33:04,912 --> 01:33:08,748
I can see where some people
might have a problem with this.

1716
01:33:08,916 --> 01:33:11,876
I realize that.
So as a token of good faith...

1717
01:33:12,128 --> 01:33:14,379
...l've taken the liberty
of writing down a few things...

1718
01:33:14,630 --> 01:33:17,173
...putting them in a safe-deposit
box in case...

1719
01:33:17,383 --> 01:33:20,343
...something should happen to me,
my friend or my family.

1720
01:33:28,185 --> 01:33:30,478
I don't know what anybody else thinks...

1721
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:33,356
...but l say good luck and God bless, Paul.

1722
01:33:37,987 --> 01:33:40,071
Thank you. Come on, let's go.

1723
01:33:40,489 --> 01:33:43,241
-l'm his friend.
Come on.

1724
01:33:50,082 --> 01:33:52,334
That was remarkable.
Do you feel proud?

1725
01:33:52,543 --> 01:33:56,171
Some people in therapy never
have breakthroughs like you had.

1726
01:33:56,339 --> 01:33:57,839
Hey, Paul!

1727
01:33:59,342 --> 01:34:00,717
I don't want to do this.

1728
01:34:00,926 --> 01:34:04,888
Think this is a civil service job?
You can just quit and walk away?

1729
01:34:05,097 --> 01:34:06,723
What are you, fucking crazy?

1730
01:34:06,932 --> 01:34:08,558
Not anymore.

1731
01:34:08,726 --> 01:34:10,101
Tell me something.

1732
01:34:10,269 --> 01:34:13,396
Will you stab me in the back like
the shit I always knew you were?

1733
01:34:13,564 --> 01:34:15,899
No, I won't stab you in the back.

1734
01:34:16,067 --> 01:34:17,942
I want to see your face when I do it.

1735
01:34:18,110 --> 01:34:20,737
Yeah? I don't think so.

1736
01:34:20,946 --> 01:34:22,405
Mo-Mo!

1737
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:24,532
Bigs!

1738
01:34:24,742 --> 01:34:26,284
Eddie!

1739
01:34:29,413 --> 01:34:31,581
It's over, Primo.

1740
01:34:31,749 --> 01:34:33,750
Now get the fuck out of here.

1741
01:34:41,759 --> 01:34:44,094
Machine gun was a nice touch.
A little hostile.

1742
01:35:18,295 --> 01:35:19,963
Hands in the air!

1743
01:35:20,131 --> 01:35:21,548
Drop your weapons!

1744
01:35:21,757 --> 01:35:23,299
Do it now!

1745
01:35:35,104 --> 01:35:36,938
I got you! Get down!

1746
01:35:41,193 --> 01:35:43,528
Get out of the car!
Hands on top of the car!

1747
01:35:43,738 --> 01:35:46,823
One fucking move, I swear l'll
blow your fucking heart out!

1748
01:35:47,032 --> 01:35:49,701
Take a pill, RoboCop! Take a pill!

1749
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:53,663
I can't believe this.
You took a bullet for me.

1750
01:35:53,873 --> 01:35:57,542
What doc would ever do that for his
patient? l'll never forget that.

1751
01:35:57,752 --> 01:35:59,586
You.... You....

1752
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:01,880
Paul, l tripped.

1753
01:36:02,089 --> 01:36:05,008
Oh, yeah, you tripped. Heh. You tripped
over your unconscious.

1754
01:36:06,051 --> 01:36:09,637
Mr. Vitti, you have the right
to remain silent....

1755
01:36:13,350 --> 01:36:15,226
Today's my wedding day.

1756
01:36:26,530 --> 01:36:28,865
You got off easy.
Eighteen months is nothing.

1757
01:36:29,074 --> 01:36:31,993
They found Primo Sindone dead
in a field near La Guardia.

1758
01:36:32,203 --> 01:36:35,163
I heard. Don't look at me.
I had nothing to do with it.

1759
01:36:35,372 --> 01:36:39,375
A million guys from here to Canarsie
were looking to whack that bastard.

1760
01:36:39,585 --> 01:36:41,753
Good. I was just checking.

1761
01:36:42,296 --> 01:36:43,338
Don't worry.

1762
01:36:45,007 --> 01:36:48,259
You think we could keep going
with the private sessions up here?

1763
01:36:48,469 --> 01:36:50,011
You'd like to do that?

1764
01:36:50,805 --> 01:36:54,224
I could arrange to come up on Saturdays.
Or we could do it by phone.

1765
01:36:54,433 --> 01:36:55,558
Phone appointments?

1766
01:36:55,768 --> 01:36:59,604
I do that when a patient's
out of town or in federal prison.

1767
01:37:06,111 --> 01:37:07,237
Thanks, Doc.

1768
01:37:12,743 --> 01:37:14,577
-Hey, doc.
-Yeah?

1769
01:37:15,621 --> 01:37:18,373
I never really got to
thank you properly...

1770
01:37:19,458 --> 01:37:20,542
...for curing me.

1771
01:37:22,044 --> 01:37:25,463
We don't say "cure." We say you had a
"corrective emotional experience."

1772
01:37:25,673 --> 01:37:26,923
Excuse me.

1773
01:37:27,091 --> 01:37:29,551
Heh, heh. You. You're something, you.

1774
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:32,262
-Yes, you are. You are something.
-You. You.

1775
01:37:33,180 --> 01:37:35,598
-No, you're something.
-No, you.

1776
01:37:35,766 --> 01:37:36,808
You!

1777
01:37:45,484 --> 01:37:46,985
-Happy?
The best is yet to come

1778
01:37:47,152 --> 01:37:48,695
I just can't get used to it.

1779
01:37:48,863 --> 01:37:49,904
Used to what?

1780
01:37:50,114 --> 01:37:52,198
It's been so long since
you were kidnapped.

1781
01:37:52,408 --> 01:37:53,575
I don't know if l can adjust.

1782
01:37:53,742 --> 01:37:55,994
Out of the tree of life

1783
01:37:56,161 --> 01:37:58,121
Listen.

1784
01:37:58,289 --> 01:38:00,915
How about one more dance...

1785
01:38:01,458 --> 01:38:04,127
-...and then we'll go upstairs?
-Okay.

1786
01:38:06,505 --> 01:38:08,923
Tony, can you do one more song?

1787
01:38:09,717 --> 01:38:10,967
Oh, anything you want.

1788
01:38:11,135 --> 01:38:14,429
You know, my friend told me to stay
as long as you needed me.

1789
01:38:14,638 --> 01:38:15,930
I don't want to let him down.

1790
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:18,600
"World On A String,"
the Harold Arlen song.

1791
01:38:18,809 --> 01:38:20,101
This is so great.

1792
01:38:22,271 --> 01:38:23,396
This is a gift.

1793
01:38:23,564 --> 01:38:26,524
I've got the world on a string

1794
01:38:27,943 --> 01:38:30,653
I'm sitting on a rainbow

1795
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:36,242
I've got the string around my finger

1796
01:38:37,703 --> 01:38:40,705
What a world, what a life

1797
01:38:42,124 --> 01:38:44,208
I'm in love

1798
01:38:48,672 --> 01:38:52,508
I've got a song that l sing

1799
01:38:52,843 --> 01:38:55,887
I can make the rain go

1800
01:38:56,600 --> 01:39:01,770
Any time I move my finger

1801
01:39:02,810 --> 01:39:07,230
Lucky me, can't you see?

1802
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:09,945
I'm in love

1803
01:39:12,110 --> 01:39:16,200
Life is a beautiful thing

1804
01:39:18,370 --> 01:39:22,205
As long as l hold that string

1805
01:39:25,085 --> 01:39:28,545
I'd be a silly so-and-so

1806
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:34,260
If I should ever let go

1807
01:39:38,345 --> 01:39:41,600
I've got the world on a string

1808
01:39:42,100 --> 01:39:45,855
I'm sitting on a rainbow

1809
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:51,315
I've got the string around my finger

1810
01:39:51,985 --> 01:39:56,030
What a world, what a life

1811
01:39:56,200 --> 01:40:03,205
I'm in love

1812
01:40:04,415 --> 01:40:06,080
Good night, Sobels.
