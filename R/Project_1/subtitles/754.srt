1
00:01:06,148 --> 00:01:08,859
This is Mr. Mathison. He's a doctor.

2
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:12,113
Are you OK?

3
00:01:12,154 --> 00:01:14,448
An ambulance is on the way.

4
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,950
Thank you.

5
00:01:22,748 --> 00:01:24,500
Is there a name yet?

6
00:01:26,168 --> 00:01:27,503
Elijah.

7
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,636
Is he supposed to be crying like this?

8
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,179
May I?

9
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,854
Shh, shh, shh, shh...

10
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,739
Can I have him back?

11
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:02,121
What happened during the delivery?

12
00:02:02,204 --> 00:02:04,832
Nothing. It was very quick.

13
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:07,084
The baby just wanted
to come right out.

14
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,794
There were no problems.

15
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,424
Did you drop him?

16
00:02:13,507 --> 00:02:15,635
What?

17
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:18,012
Did you drop this baby?

18
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,306
Jesus Christ, no.

19
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:28,147
Inform the ambulance
that we have a situation.

20
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,025
- All right.
- Ma'am.

21
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:34,320
I've never seen... this.

22
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:41,118
It appears that your baby
has sustained some fractures

23
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:43,204
while inside your uterus.

24
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:49,418
His arms and his legs are broken.

25
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,137
<i>This is Eastrail 177.</i>

26
00:03:41,178 --> 00:03:43,222
<i>Next stop, Philadelphia.</i>

27
00:04:17,047 --> 00:04:18,424
Are you alone?

28
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:23,512
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

29
00:05:09,016 --> 00:05:11,185
Someone left this magazine.

30
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,354
Want to take a look at it?

31
00:05:13,395 --> 00:05:16,065
Can I take a look at that one?

32
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,572
Thanks.

33
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,533
You like sports?

34
00:05:25,574 --> 00:05:26,742
It's my field.

35
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,994
I represent athletes. I'm an agent.

36
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:33,499
Are you looking for any male
synchronized swimmers?

37
00:05:33,582 --> 00:05:35,835
I'm thinking about getting into that.

38
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,503
Is that right?

39
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:43,884
I'm afraid of water.
Think that's a problem?

40
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:54,645
You represent someone
in Philadelphia?

41
00:05:54,728 --> 00:05:57,273
I'm meeting this player
from Temple university.

42
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:59,400
He's a cornerback.

43
00:05:59,441 --> 00:06:03,279
This kid is 6'1", 210 pounds.

44
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:07,449
He runs a 40 in 4.3 seconds.
He's gonna be a god.

45
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,202
Do you like football?

46
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,288
Not really.

47
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,427
I'm David Dunn.

48
00:06:26,468 --> 00:06:27,803
- Kelly.
- Hi.

49
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,055
Hi, nice to meet you.

50
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,474
Nice... Nice to meet you.

51
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,818
How long are you gonna be
in Philadelphia?

52
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,328
I'm married.

53
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:53,579
Great.

54
00:06:53,662 --> 00:06:55,080
I'm sorry.

55
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,541
What are you talking about?

56
00:07:01,837 --> 00:07:04,089
I think you misunderstood.

57
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,591
What I was...

58
00:07:06,842 --> 00:07:08,594
- saying...
- I know.

59
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:13,307
I think I'm going to find
another seat.

60
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:16,101
I... I didn't mean...

61
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:59,121
<i>That's what he fail to realize.
I look classy, not trashy.</i>

62
00:08:59,204 --> 00:09:00,622
<i>I look classy too.</i>

63
00:09:00,664 --> 00:09:02,875
<i>What about me?
Don't I look classy?</i>

64
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,170
<i>But I'm afraid you forgot... this!</i>

65
00:09:06,253 --> 00:09:07,463
<i>And this!</i>

66
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:10,466
<i>Where has you been, Banana?</i>

67
00:09:10,507 --> 00:09:12,801
<i>Now I've got you, Weasel.</i>

68
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,845
<i>Some cars are still on fire,</i>

69
00:09:14,928 --> 00:09:17,473
<i>and the debris is everywhere.</i>

70
00:09:17,514 --> 00:09:18,974
<i>We are not sure at this time</i>

71
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,935
<i>how rescue personnel will be
able to get on scene at all.</i>

72
00:09:21,977 --> 00:09:23,687
<i>If you're just tuning in,</i>

73
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:27,316
<i>Eastrail train number 177
has derailed outside Philadelphia.</i>

74
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:29,693
<i>We're bringing you
live coverage from Skycam 4.</i>

75
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:33,363
<i>That appears to be a rescue
ambulance. There are more behind it.</i>

76
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,990
<i>I can see on the access road.</i>

77
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,951
<i>I don't know how close they're
gonna be able to get, David.</i>

78
00:09:37,993 --> 00:09:40,120
<i>These are woods and... trees.</i>

79
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:43,165
<i>It's gonna be a very difficult
rescue effort.</i>

80
00:09:58,722 --> 00:10:00,682
Hack some of that off.

81
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,239
Hi.

82
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:17,407
I'm Dr. Dubin.

83
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:21,370
You're in the emergency room
in the Philadelphia City Hospital.

84
00:10:21,411 --> 00:10:24,456
You were in a serious accident.

85
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,708
Look at me.

86
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,377
How are you feeling?

87
00:10:30,712 --> 00:10:32,923
- OK.
- Good.

88
00:10:33,006 --> 00:10:35,592
I'm gonna ask you some questions.

89
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:39,555
Have you ever had any heart
or asthma problems in the past?

90
00:10:39,596 --> 00:10:40,806
No.

91
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:43,851
Kidney or renal problems?

92
00:10:43,892 --> 00:10:45,102
No.

93
00:10:45,185 --> 00:10:46,728
Any allergies?

94
00:10:48,605 --> 00:10:50,315
No.

95
00:10:55,028 --> 00:10:57,531
Where were you sitting on the train?

96
00:11:01,493 --> 00:11:04,580
- Against the window.
- In the passenger car?

97
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,250
Yeah.

98
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,629
Where are the other passengers?

99
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,756
Was your family traveling with you?

100
00:11:17,217 --> 00:11:19,094
No.

101
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,930
Did you get up from your seat?

102
00:11:27,477 --> 00:11:30,480
Are you certain
you were in the passenger car?

103
00:11:35,944 --> 00:11:37,112
Yes.

104
00:11:45,412 --> 00:11:48,290
Why are you looking at me
like that?

105
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,459
Your train derailed.

106
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,170
Some kind of malfunction.

107
00:11:53,253 --> 00:11:56,298
They only found
two people alive so far.

108
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:58,592
You and this man.

109
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,095
His skull was cracked open,

110
00:12:02,137 --> 00:12:05,599
and most of his left side
was crushed.

111
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:08,602
And to answer your question,
there are two reasons

112
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:11,438
why I'm looking at you like this.

113
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,107
One, because it seems,
in a few minutes,

114
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:18,862
that you will officially be
the only survivor of this train wreck.

115
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,823
And two...

116
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,326
because you didn't
break one bone.

117
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,621
You don't have a scratch on you.

118
00:14:13,268 --> 00:14:14,311
David?

119
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:20,317
What happened...

120
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,110
in New York?

121
00:14:23,695 --> 00:14:26,323
I don't think I got the job.

122
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,659
I'm still going...

123
00:14:31,286 --> 00:14:33,121
I'm still moving there.

124
00:14:34,247 --> 00:14:35,957
Just...

125
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,294
Oh, just... just not now.

126
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,510
Good night.

127
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:51,390
Good night.

128
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:08,824
Sara Elaston, social worker
at Broad and Locust Community Center.

129
00:15:09,991 --> 00:15:12,327
We pray for your soul.

130
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:19,000
Kevin Elliot, businessman,
father of six.

131
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,337
We pray for your soul.

132
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,258
Glen Stevens,

133
00:15:26,341 --> 00:15:29,678
researcher in the area of leukemia

134
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:31,847
at Drexel University.

135
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,183
We pray for your soul.

136
00:15:37,352 --> 00:15:39,521
Jennifer Pennyman,

137
00:15:39,604 --> 00:15:43,775
third-grade teacher
at Jefferson Elementary.

138
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,863
We pray for your soul.

139
00:16:55,096 --> 00:16:56,306
Yes?

140
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:58,266
Is Noel in, ma'am?

141
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,435
No, sir, he is not.

142
00:17:01,811 --> 00:17:04,439
I read about you in the paper.

143
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,649
What?

144
00:17:05,732 --> 00:17:07,984
I was in an accident once too.

145
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,779
A horse almost
trampled me to death.

146
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,448
- Wow.
- Had him put down.

147
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,285
That's a sad story.

148
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:25,669
Could you ask Noel
something for me, please?

149
00:17:25,752 --> 00:17:27,879
Proceed.

150
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,382
Ask him to check
how many sick days I've taken

151
00:17:30,465 --> 00:17:34,386
- since I've worked here?
- That the entire message?

152
00:17:34,469 --> 00:17:35,637
Yes, ma'am.

153
00:17:39,015 --> 00:17:40,433
Thank you.

154
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,349
Hey, Noel.

155
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,560
What, you hit your head on that train?

156
00:18:23,643 --> 00:18:25,979
Get your brain to start working again?

157
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:28,815
What?

158
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,233
Forty dollars.

159
00:18:31,234 --> 00:18:34,404
- Forty dollars what?
- You're getting a $40-a-week raise.

160
00:18:34,487 --> 00:18:35,822
That's it.

161
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,533
I checked. You were right.

162
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,577
You've never taken a sick day.

163
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,497
Five years, no sick day.
I get it. You want a raise.

164
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:46,541
Smart way to make your point.

165
00:19:13,234 --> 00:19:14,444
Is Joseph OK?

166
00:19:14,527 --> 00:19:17,572
Yeah. He's asleep.

167
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,782
Oh.

168
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,493
Uh...

169
00:19:22,577 --> 00:19:25,038
I wanted to ask you a question.

170
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,040
It's gonna sound a little strange,

171
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:31,044
but just think about it
for a second, OK?

172
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,379
OK.

173
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:36,049
When's the last time I was sick?

174
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,550
Do you remember?

175
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,723
Um, I don't know.

176
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,520
It's been a while.

177
00:19:48,603 --> 00:19:52,232
I haven't been sick this year,
I know that.

178
00:19:52,273 --> 00:19:54,442
OK.

179
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,653
Do you remember me getting sick?

180
00:19:59,864 --> 00:20:01,449
Um...

181
00:20:02,283 --> 00:20:04,577
Not a specific day.

182
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:07,664
What... what's this about?

183
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,627
Audrey, do you remember me
ever getting sick?

184
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,755
In the three years
we lived in this house?

185
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,799
In the old apartment?

186
00:20:17,882 --> 00:20:21,010
Before Joseph was born?
Before we ever got married?

187
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,142
I... I can't remember.

188
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:31,438
Don't you think that's kind of weird,

189
00:20:31,479 --> 00:20:35,692
not remembering one cold
or a fever or a sore throat?

190
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,821
What do you think it means?

191
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,244
Um...

192
00:20:47,662 --> 00:20:51,708
I think it means probably
too tired to remember.

193
00:21:32,957 --> 00:21:34,876
No more sitting in this room.

194
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:37,545
I let it go on long enough.

195
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:40,882
I'm not going out there anymore.
I'm not getting hurt again.

196
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:44,844
- This was the last time, I told you.
- You can't do anything about that.

197
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:47,722
You might fall between
this chair and that television.

198
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,850
If that's what God has planned
for you, that's gonna happen.

199
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,686
You can't hide from it
sitting in a room.

200
00:21:56,689 --> 00:21:58,942
They call me Mr. Glass at school

201
00:21:59,025 --> 00:22:01,110
because I break like glass.

202
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:08,159
You make this decision now...

203
00:22:09,577 --> 00:22:12,997
to be afraid...

204
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:15,458
and you will never turn back.

205
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:21,965
Your whole life,
you will always be afraid.

206
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:39,274
- I got a present for you.
- Why?

207
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,402
Forget why.

208
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,031
You want it or not?

209
00:22:50,451 --> 00:22:52,704
Well, go get it, then.

210
00:22:52,787 --> 00:22:53,997
Where is it?

211
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,041
On a bench...

212
00:22:58,293 --> 00:22:59,961
across the street.

213
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,144
Someone's gonna take it.

214
00:23:18,354 --> 00:23:21,316
Then you better
get out there soon.

215
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:37,392
I bought a whole bunch.

216
00:24:41,562 --> 00:24:44,232
There'll be one of these
waiting for you

217
00:24:44,273 --> 00:24:46,901
every time you want
to come out here.

218
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:56,160
They say this one
has a surprise ending.

219
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,922
This is from Fritz Campion's
own library.

220
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:12,677
This is before the first issue of
the comic book hit the stands in 1963.

221
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:17,640
It's a classic depiction
of good versus evil.

222
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,600
Notice the square jaw of Slayer,

223
00:25:19,642 --> 00:25:21,561
common in most comic heroes.

224
00:25:21,602 --> 00:25:25,440
And the slightly disproportionate size
of Jaguaro's head to his body.

225
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:28,401
This again is common,
but only in villains.

226
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:29,777
Mmm.

227
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,988
The thing to notice about this piece,

228
00:25:32,071 --> 00:25:36,159
the thing that makes it
very, very special

229
00:25:36,242 --> 00:25:39,245
is its realistic depiction
of its figures.

230
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,622
When the characters
reached the magazine,

231
00:25:41,664 --> 00:25:43,750
they were exaggerated...

232
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:46,085
as always happens.

233
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:49,964
This... is vintage.

234
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:53,760
Well...

235
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:02,268
wrap it up.

236
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,979
You've made
a considerably wise decision.

237
00:26:10,276 --> 00:26:12,278
Well, my kid's gonna go berserk.

238
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,325
Once again, please?

239
00:26:17,366 --> 00:26:20,536
My son Jeb, it's a gift for him.

240
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,623
- How old is Jeb?
- He's four.

241
00:26:26,417 --> 00:26:28,669
No.

242
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:32,548
No, no, no, no, no.

243
00:26:33,841 --> 00:26:36,803
You need to go. Now.

244
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:40,223
What... what'd I say?

245
00:26:40,306 --> 00:26:42,892
Do you see any Teletubbies in here?

246
00:26:42,975 --> 00:26:45,228
Do you see a slender plastic tag

247
00:26:45,311 --> 00:26:48,022
clipped to my shirt
with my name printed on it?

248
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:51,067
An Asian child
with a blank expression sitting outside

249
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:54,862
in a mechanical helicopter that shakes
when you put quarters in it?

250
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,364
No?

251
00:26:56,447 --> 00:26:58,533
Well, that's what you see
at a toy store,

252
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,576
and you must think
you're in a toy store

253
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,413
because you're here shopping
for an infant named Jeb.

254
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:07,500
Now one of us
has made a gross error

255
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:10,586
and wasted the other person's
valuable time.

256
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,922
This is an art gallery, my friend,

257
00:27:13,005 --> 00:27:14,048
and this...

258
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,134
is a piece of art.

259
00:27:32,066 --> 00:27:33,568
We're by appointment only.

260
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:39,490
- I got a card from this store.
- Congratulations, you have a mailbox.

261
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:42,201
The exhibition isn't for two weeks.

262
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:45,538
This one was under
the windshield wiper of my car.

263
00:27:48,082 --> 00:27:51,085
How certain are you
that you've never taken ill?

264
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,588
Seventy-five percent.

265
00:27:53,629 --> 00:27:55,423
Well...

266
00:27:55,506 --> 00:27:58,593
that's not certain at all, is it?

267
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:01,137
That's hole number one.

268
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:04,849
I'm going to be extremely
skeptical about all this.

269
00:28:04,932 --> 00:28:06,350
About all what?

270
00:28:07,643 --> 00:28:11,772
I'm assuming you've never been injured.
Would I be wrong in that assumption?

271
00:28:11,814 --> 00:28:13,774
Dad's been injured.

272
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,819
Is the child correct?

273
00:28:18,112 --> 00:28:20,031
Yes, sir.

274
00:28:20,114 --> 00:28:22,283
In college, I was in a car accident.

275
00:28:22,366 --> 00:28:27,121
- Was it serious?
- He couldn't play football anymore.

276
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,831
That's hole number two.

277
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:32,793
That's a big one.

278
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:40,426
Mr. Price, can we talk about the note
that you left on my car?

279
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:43,471
I've studied the form
of comics intimately.

280
00:28:43,554 --> 00:28:46,140
I've spent a third of my life
in a hospital bed

281
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:49,310
with nothing else to do but read.

282
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:51,479
I believe comics are our last link

283
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,149
to an ancient way
of passing on history.

284
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,318
The Egyptians drew on the walls.

285
00:28:57,401 --> 00:29:01,739
Countries all over the world still pass
on knowledge through pictorial forms.

286
00:29:01,822 --> 00:29:04,158
I believe comics
are a form of history

287
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:07,411
that someone somewhere
felt or experienced.

288
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:10,873
Then, of course, those experiences
and history got chewed up

289
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:14,377
in the commercial machine,
got jazzed up, made titillating,

290
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,254
cartooned for the sale rack.

291
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:21,008
This city has seen its share
of disasters.

292
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,594
I watched the aftermath
of that plane crash.

293
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:26,347
I watched the carnage
of the hotel fire.

294
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,349
I watched the news waiting to hear

295
00:29:28,432 --> 00:29:33,854
a very specific combination of words,
but they never came.

296
00:29:33,896 --> 00:29:37,733
Then one day I saw a news story
about a train accident,

297
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:39,944
and I heard them.

298
00:29:40,027 --> 00:29:42,029
"There is a sole survivor,

299
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:45,366
and he is miraculously unharmed."

300
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:51,622
I have something called
osteogenesis imperfecta.

301
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:55,960
It's a genetic disorder. I don't make
a particular protein very well,

302
00:29:56,043 --> 00:29:58,629
and it makes my bones
very low in density.

303
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,923
Very easy to break.

304
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:03,592
I've had 54 breaks in my life,

305
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:08,472
and I have the tamest version
of this disorder, type one.

306
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:12,101
There are type two,
type three, type four.

307
00:30:12,184 --> 00:30:15,646
Type fours don't last very long.

308
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:19,066
So that's how it popped into my head.

309
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:21,902
If there is someone like me
in the world,

310
00:30:21,944 --> 00:30:24,071
and I'm at one end of the spectrum,

311
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:28,576
couldn't there be someone else
the opposite of me at the other end?

312
00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:30,328
Someone who doesn't get sick,

313
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:33,122
who doesn't get hurt
like the rest of us?

314
00:30:33,205 --> 00:30:36,834
And he probably
doesn't even know it.

315
00:30:36,917 --> 00:30:41,797
The kind of person
these stories are about.

316
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:47,345
A person put here
to protect the rest of us.

317
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:48,929
To guard us.

318
00:30:51,265 --> 00:30:53,184
You think my dad's a real...

319
00:30:53,267 --> 00:30:56,604
I don't think anything right now.

320
00:30:56,687 --> 00:30:58,981
It's a possibility...

321
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,275
one with many holes.

322
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,782
Joseph, don't take another sip
of that water.

323
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:11,952
Go throw it in the trash.

324
00:31:11,994 --> 00:31:14,789
- But, Dad...
- Do it now, please.

325
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:27,176
I see guys like you
all the time in my work.

326
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:31,639
You find someone
you want to take advantage of,

327
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,226
you tell them a fantastic story,

328
00:31:35,309 --> 00:31:38,229
and somewhere in there
you say it:

329
00:31:38,312 --> 00:31:41,148
"I just need
your credit card number...

330
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:44,068
a small down payment."

331
00:31:45,569 --> 00:31:48,322
This morning was the first morning
I could remember

332
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,825
that I didn't open my eyes
and feel...

333
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,162
sadness.

334
00:31:58,582 --> 00:32:01,919
I thought the person who wrote
that note had an answer for me.

335
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:10,261
I'm gonna leave now.

336
00:32:11,887 --> 00:32:14,014
Good luck with your exhibition.

337
00:32:14,056 --> 00:32:16,183
So, what kind of job
do you have, David?

338
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,727
You said you've met guys like me
in your work.

339
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,563
What exactly is it that you do?

340
00:32:20,646 --> 00:32:25,109
I work at the university stadium.
I'm a security guard.

341
00:34:41,328 --> 00:34:42,580
Hi.

342
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:45,499
I've come to a decision.

343
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,419
OK.

344
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,839
I just want to ask you
something, OK?

345
00:34:51,922 --> 00:34:55,301
And you can be totally honest.

346
00:34:55,342 --> 00:34:59,763
I'm prepared for any answer,
and it won't affect me.

347
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:04,518
Have you been with anyone?

348
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,854
I mean, since we've been
having problems.

349
00:35:06,937 --> 00:35:08,522
The answer won't affect me.

350
00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:15,029
I just need to know, you know?

351
00:35:15,112 --> 00:35:17,531
It won't affect me either way.

352
00:35:19,366 --> 00:35:20,659
No.

353
00:35:29,084 --> 00:35:31,712
Sorry, David. Sorry.

354
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:39,053
Anyway...

355
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,888
my decision is...

356
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,226
that I want to start again.

357
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:53,567
That I want it to be like it was
in the beginning.

358
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:59,573
And it's a big deal that you
walked away from that train.

359
00:36:02,409 --> 00:36:04,662
I feel like it's a second chance.

360
00:36:10,584 --> 00:36:14,004
And if you feel like
asking me out sometime,

361
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,673
it'd be OK.

362
00:36:18,425 --> 00:36:19,760
OK.

363
00:36:32,856 --> 00:36:35,275
- <i>Dunn.</i>
- Go for Dunn.

364
00:36:35,317 --> 00:36:36,819
<i>It's Jenkins.</i>

365
00:36:36,902 --> 00:36:39,988
<i>Look, we got a guy over
at gate 17-C with a bogus ticket.</i>

366
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:44,034
<i>Says he knows you.
He won't tell me his name.</i>

367
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:46,578
What's he look like?

368
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,330
Why is it, do you think,

369
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:52,835
that, of all the professions
in the world, you chose protection?

370
00:36:52,918 --> 00:36:54,837
You are a very strange man.

371
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,798
You could have been a tax accountant,
owned your own gym,

372
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,635
opened a chain of restaurants.
You could've done one of 10,000 things,

373
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:05,806
but in the end,
you chose to protect people.

374
00:37:05,889 --> 00:37:07,683
You made that decision,

375
00:37:07,766 --> 00:37:10,602
and I find that
very, very interesting.

376
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:14,732
Now all I need is
your credit card number.

377
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:17,735
That last part was a joke.

378
00:37:21,905 --> 00:37:23,949
You're a big sports fan, are you?

379
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:26,660
It's starting to intrigue me.

380
00:37:27,661 --> 00:37:30,497
It gets heaviest
ten minutes before kickoff.

381
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:44,720
Program here. Program.

382
00:37:44,803 --> 00:37:46,054
Program.

383
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:49,850
Program.

384
00:37:52,394 --> 00:37:54,563
- Rich, why don't we pat down?
- Right.

385
00:37:54,646 --> 00:37:57,065
- Just give me a minute.
- Is there a problem?

386
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:59,735
I'm sorry, I'm gonna
have to search you.

387
00:37:59,818 --> 00:38:02,196
The tall guy in
the camouflage jacket.

388
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:04,990
Sometimes people
carry weapons in here,

389
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:06,992
and they drink too much.

390
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:11,246
If the team's not doing good,
bad things can happen.

391
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:15,042
We do pat-downs of the crowd
to discourage people from carrying.

392
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,587
If he's carrying,
he'll step out of line.

393
00:38:32,142 --> 00:38:33,769
Yeah, step right up here.

394
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,029
OK.

395
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:47,783
I got you a seat
up in the yellow section.

396
00:38:47,866 --> 00:38:49,117
It's in the nosebleeds,

397
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:52,746
but at least you won't get spit on.

398
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,956
All right.

399
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:57,292
How'd you know that guy you bumped
was carrying a weapon?

400
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,755
I don't know.

401
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:06,176
Maybe it was that camouflage
army jacket he was wearing.

402
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,680
Those guys like to carry
hunting knives and stuff for show.

403
00:39:09,763 --> 00:39:12,224
You thought
he was carrying a knife?

404
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:14,726
I thought he was
carrying something, yeah.

405
00:39:14,768 --> 00:39:16,144
But not a knife.

406
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:21,400
I got a...

407
00:39:21,441 --> 00:39:24,444
picture of a silver gun
with a black grip

408
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,780
tucked in his pants.

409
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:29,283
You know, like on TV.

410
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:33,495
You have good instincts
for things like that?

411
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:34,705
Like what?

412
00:39:34,788 --> 00:39:37,916
Knowing when people
have done something wrong.

413
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,712
Yeah.

414
00:39:41,795 --> 00:39:44,631
Have you ever tried to develop it?

415
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,967
I don't know what you're asking me.

416
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,260
Your skill.

417
00:39:48,635 --> 00:39:51,763
Look, I got to be down
on the sidelines during the game.

418
00:39:51,805 --> 00:39:53,807
You can get to your seat
right down...

419
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:57,060
Characters in comics are often
attributed special powers...

420
00:39:57,144 --> 00:40:01,440
Invisibility, X-ray vision,
things of that sort.

421
00:40:01,481 --> 00:40:03,317
OK.

422
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,028
I don't want to play
this game anymore.

423
00:40:06,111 --> 00:40:08,655
It's an exaggeration of the truth.

424
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:12,868
Maybe it's based on something
as simple as instinct.

425
00:40:12,951 --> 00:40:15,412
But he might not have been
carrying anything.

426
00:40:15,495 --> 00:40:17,831
But he might have been
carrying a silver gun

427
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:19,833
with a black grip tucked in his pants.

428
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,793
<i>Dunn.</i>

429
00:40:21,835 --> 00:40:23,128
I gotta go.

430
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:27,341
Yeah, I know. I'll be right down.

431
00:40:27,424 --> 00:40:30,761
- One last question.
- What?

432
00:40:30,844 --> 00:40:34,890
That car accident you were in.
Was there anyone else involved?

433
00:40:37,434 --> 00:40:40,771
Yeah. My wife Audrey.

434
00:40:40,854 --> 00:40:43,106
She was in the car with me.

435
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,152
Have a good life, Elijah.

436
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:51,281
Next time, try to buy your tickets
at an authorized sales location.

437
00:40:54,242 --> 00:40:55,661
I'm on my way.

438
00:40:59,581 --> 00:41:02,334
<i>into the investigation of train 177</i>

439
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:05,212
<i>being conducted at the Eastrail
holding warehouses.</i>

440
00:41:05,253 --> 00:41:07,839
<i>The city council has stepped up
plans to pass a bill</i>

441
00:41:07,881 --> 00:41:11,259
<i>requiring higher standards
for inspection and maintenance</i>

442
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:15,597
<i>of all rail transportation in
Philadelphia and its outlying districts.</i>

443
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:25,565
Hold up a second!

444
00:42:20,537 --> 00:42:23,123
I just want to ask you something.

445
00:43:32,692 --> 00:43:34,319
Dad!

446
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:35,529
Hey, Dad!

447
00:43:42,452 --> 00:43:43,703
Dad!

448
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:57,050
Joseph, do you know how mad
your mother would be

449
00:43:57,134 --> 00:44:00,804
- if she knew you were playing football?
- Are you gonna tell?

450
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:05,642
You want to play last set of downs?
We got a big guy like you.

451
00:44:05,725 --> 00:44:08,061
You could play on opposite sides.

452
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,771
He's Potter's cousin.

453
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,607
He's starting cornerback
at Temple University.

454
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:14,568
He's going pro in the draft.

455
00:44:14,609 --> 00:44:18,155
They say he can run
the 40 in 4.3 seconds.

456
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:20,157
I've heard.

457
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,243
You can beat him, Dad.
Let's beat 'em.

458
00:44:23,326 --> 00:44:24,661
I'm gonna go in.

459
00:44:24,744 --> 00:44:27,414
Just one set of downs.
I told them you were great.

460
00:44:27,497 --> 00:44:29,624
- Why'd you do that?
- Just one.

461
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:31,960
I'm gonna go in.
I've got some things to do.

462
00:44:32,043 --> 00:44:34,671
- What things?
- I'm gonna work out.

463
00:44:34,754 --> 00:44:36,756
- I'll help you.
- I don't need...

464
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,843
I can't play, guys!
I'm working out with my dad!

465
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:45,432
Hut! You're doing good.

466
00:44:45,473 --> 00:44:46,766
Right there! Catch!

467
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:02,782
How much did you put on there?

468
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:15,295
You put too much.
That's 250 pounds.

469
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:18,840
How much can you lift?

470
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:22,469
That's the most I ever lifted.

471
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:27,015
That could've been dangerous, Joseph.

472
00:45:27,098 --> 00:45:30,185
Why don't you go upstairs now
and let me finish up, OK?

473
00:45:30,268 --> 00:45:33,188
I'll take it off.
I'll help you right.

474
00:45:37,442 --> 00:45:41,112
You think you could have
beaten up Bruce Lee?

475
00:45:41,154 --> 00:45:43,156
No.

476
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:46,701
- I mean, if you knew karate.
- No.

477
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:55,126
What if he wasn't allowed to kick,
and you were really mad at him?

478
00:45:55,168 --> 00:45:56,836
No, Joseph.

479
00:46:38,211 --> 00:46:40,130
How much did you take off?

480
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:44,509
I lied.

481
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:49,222
You added?

482
00:46:57,647 --> 00:46:59,607
How much is it?

483
00:47:01,067 --> 00:47:03,570
Two hundred and seventy pounds.

484
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,241
Let's put more.

485
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,705
OK.

486
00:47:17,083 --> 00:47:20,253
Why don't you move back a little
just to be safe, OK?

487
00:47:53,286 --> 00:47:54,496
More?

488
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:09,010
You should never do
anything like this.

489
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:10,512
You know that, right?

490
00:48:12,138 --> 00:48:14,891
What do you do
if something bad happens?

491
00:48:14,974 --> 00:48:16,142
Get Mom.

492
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:19,354
Right.

493
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:56,349
How much did you put on that time?

494
00:49:00,478 --> 00:49:03,189
All of it.

495
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:06,651
What else can we use?

496
00:49:33,386 --> 00:49:34,888
How much is it?

497
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:45,940
How much is it, Dad?

498
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:51,488
About 350 pounds.

499
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:01,247
Fracture
of the fifth metacarpal,

500
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:04,751
as well as multiple fractures of
the sixth, seventh and eighth ribs.

501
00:50:04,834 --> 00:50:06,002
The worst of the injury

502
00:50:06,085 --> 00:50:09,380
was sustained to the right leg
in the form of a spiral fracture.

503
00:50:09,422 --> 00:50:12,509
There were 14 breaks.
It simply shattered.

504
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:16,554
They call me Mr. Glass.

505
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:19,349
- Who does?
- Kids.

506
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:24,103
Are you all right, Mr. Price?
Shall I continue?

507
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:28,441
Pins were placed throughout
the length of the leg.

508
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:31,611
The use of a wheelchair will be
needed for a two-month period.

509
00:50:31,694 --> 00:50:34,614
The use of crutches will follow
for 12 to 14 months.

510
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:37,158
Hospital stay will range
from five to eight days

511
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:39,827
followed by nine to 12 months
of physical therapy.

512
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:42,163
Prescribed medication
for pain management

513
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:46,167
will take the usual forms
of morphine drip, Percocet, Darvocet.

514
00:50:57,136 --> 00:51:01,474
Your 10:00 is here. The hospital
discharged him this morning.

515
00:51:03,726 --> 00:51:04,894
Thanks.

516
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:15,822
Elijah, right?

517
00:51:15,905 --> 00:51:18,449
We're gonna prevent
any substantial atrophy

518
00:51:18,491 --> 00:51:21,828
of your good leg with this,
and it works your quadriceps.

519
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:26,833
How long have you been married?

520
00:51:28,209 --> 00:51:29,502
Twelve years.

521
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,671
How'd you get together?

522
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,508
I'm a little nervous being here.

523
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:39,345
I ask too many questions
when I'm nervous.

524
00:51:41,097 --> 00:51:43,182
A car accident.

525
00:51:43,224 --> 00:51:44,350
Oh.

526
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:47,020
Now you're gonna have
to tell me more.

527
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,610
My husband
was a star athlete in college,

528
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:56,029
and we were
in an accident together.

529
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:59,782
Our car flipped on an icy road,
we were both injured.

530
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:02,952
He couldn't play football anymore.
If that hadn't happened,

531
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:04,662
we wouldn't have been together.

532
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:06,247
How so?

533
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:08,374
I think we should
talk about your rehab.

534
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:11,628
You don't have to answer
if you don't want to.

535
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:15,632
So tell me more
about the quad machine.

536
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:22,305
It prevents atrophy by...
I couldn't spend my life

537
00:52:22,388 --> 00:52:26,809
with someone who played football.
It's pretty much that simple.

538
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:30,271
I don't hate the game. I admire
the amount of skill it involves.

539
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:33,316
Like everyone else, I was in awe
of the way he played it,

540
00:52:33,399 --> 00:52:38,446
but football, in many ways,
is the opposite of what I do.

541
00:52:38,529 --> 00:52:41,366
You're rewarded the more
you punish your opponent.

542
00:52:41,407 --> 00:52:45,870
It's too much about violence,
and I don't want violence in my life.

543
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:49,499
It's not a thing many people
can understand, but...

544
00:52:49,582 --> 00:52:52,585
Anyway, fate stepped in
with that car accident

545
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:55,088
and took football
out of the equation.

546
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:58,633
And everyone lived happily ever after.

547
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:01,427
Sort of.

548
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:04,347
What part of David's body was injured?

549
00:53:06,265 --> 00:53:09,060
Who said my husband's name
was David?

550
00:53:15,566 --> 00:53:19,112
- Let's just go to our seats, OK?
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

551
00:53:30,581 --> 00:53:32,166
<i>In the first half...</i>

552
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:55,773
<i>No!</i>

553
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:04,115
A 737 crashes on takeoff,

554
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:06,659
172 die, no survivors.

555
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:08,828
A hotel fire downtown,

556
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:11,706
211 die, no survivors.

557
00:54:11,789 --> 00:54:15,835
An Eastrail train derails seven
and a half miles outside the city,

558
00:54:15,918 --> 00:54:18,129
131 die,

559
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:20,173
one survivor.

560
00:54:20,256 --> 00:54:22,550
He is unharmed.

561
00:54:22,633 --> 00:54:25,595
I've spoken with your husband
about his survival.

562
00:54:25,678 --> 00:54:28,514
I suggested a rather
unbelievable possibility.

563
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:31,768
Since then, I've come
to believe that possibility,

564
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:36,397
however unbelievable,
is now more a probability.

565
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:39,400
And what was it you suggested?

566
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:42,153
These are mediocre times,
Mrs. Dunn.

567
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:45,782
People are starting to lose hope.
It's hard for many to believe

568
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:49,744
there are extraordinary things
inside themselves as well as others.

569
00:54:49,827 --> 00:54:52,997
I hope you can keep
an open mind.

570
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:08,304
Defense!

571
00:55:08,387 --> 00:55:09,847
Defense!

572
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:11,390
Defense!

573
00:55:11,432 --> 00:55:13,059
Defense!

574
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:14,769
Defense!

575
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:32,620
OK, here you go.

576
00:55:32,703 --> 00:55:34,997
Thanks a lot.

577
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:36,499
Excuse me, sir?

578
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:41,212
Can you step out of line, please?

579
00:55:44,131 --> 00:55:48,177
We've been having problems with people
selling drugs here in the stadium.

580
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:50,638
Would you mind
if I check your pockets?

581
00:55:51,722 --> 00:55:53,641
Raise your arms, please.

582
00:55:54,767 --> 00:55:56,769
Come on, raise them up.

583
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,980
I just got here, man.

584
00:56:09,782 --> 00:56:12,785
Can I put my hands down now?

585
00:56:17,373 --> 00:56:19,458
Can I go?

586
00:56:20,626 --> 00:56:21,752
Yeah.

587
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:26,215
Hope you find them.

588
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:38,436
<i>Yo, Dunn.</i>

589
00:56:38,477 --> 00:56:39,812
Yeah.

590
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:42,899
<i>I just came into the office.
Your kid was hurt.</i>

591
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:47,278
- Where is he?
- <i>Some play rehearsal at school.</i>

592
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,488
<i>He wants you to come down there.</i>

593
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:06,547
Is that your dad?

594
00:57:09,842 --> 00:57:12,887
I bet my dad
could beat up your dad.

595
00:57:15,806 --> 00:57:19,101
No. He...
he insisted we call only you,

596
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:21,729
though we had some trouble
tracking you down.

597
00:57:21,812 --> 00:57:24,899
I mean, you're not on our list.

598
00:57:24,982 --> 00:57:29,111
- Audrey handles this type of stuff.
- Oh, what type of stuff?

599
00:57:30,988 --> 00:57:32,406
Joseph stuff.

600
00:57:35,701 --> 00:57:38,663
Do I need to put any smelly
ointment on him or anything?

601
00:57:38,704 --> 00:57:40,706
No, no. It's more emotional damage,

602
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:44,210
not... not too serious, physically.

603
00:57:44,293 --> 00:57:48,756
Nothing like when I sent you
to the hospital.

604
00:57:51,717 --> 00:57:53,928
When was that?

605
00:57:54,011 --> 00:57:58,683
My office was on the other side
of the building back then.

606
00:58:01,185 --> 00:58:04,105
You don't remember me, do you?

607
00:58:06,023 --> 00:58:07,358
No, ma'am.

608
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,402
I had red hair.

609
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:17,076
Well, you were a little younger
than Joseph when it happened.

610
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:19,078
Did you know that we changed

611
00:58:19,161 --> 00:58:23,374
the rules of conduct
around the pool because of you?

612
00:58:25,918 --> 00:58:30,381
The kids still tell about it
like it was some sort of ghost story.

613
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:35,553
"Did you know there was a kid
nearly drowned in that pool?

614
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:40,850
He lay on the bottom of the pool
for five minutes,

615
00:58:40,933 --> 00:58:44,603
and when they pulled him out,
he was dead."

616
00:58:49,483 --> 00:58:53,863
We let them tell it.
It helps keep them safe.

617
00:58:57,074 --> 00:58:59,493
You still phobic of water?

618
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:04,540
It was Potter and another guy.

619
00:59:05,916 --> 00:59:09,879
They were messing with this
Chinese girl in the dressing room.

620
00:59:09,962 --> 00:59:13,340
You can't let bad things happen
to good people, right?

621
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:15,885
That's your code, right?

622
00:59:15,968 --> 00:59:17,928
That's the hero's code.

623
00:59:19,513 --> 00:59:22,892
I tried to make them stop,
but they kept pushing me down,

624
00:59:22,975 --> 00:59:25,561
and they wouldn't let me get back up.

625
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:32,318
I thought maybe
'cause you're my dad...

626
00:59:32,401 --> 00:59:35,821
I thought I might be like you.

627
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:40,284
I'm not like you.

628
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:44,121
You are like me.

629
00:59:45,372 --> 00:59:47,833
We can both get hurt.

630
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:52,296
- I'm just an ordinary man.
- No, you're not.

631
00:59:53,422 --> 00:59:55,674
Why do you keep saying that?

632
01:00:03,849 --> 01:00:07,103
Elijah Price came
to visit me at the center today.

633
01:00:08,229 --> 01:00:09,355
Jesus.

634
01:00:11,148 --> 01:00:14,193
He didn't do anything.
He just...

635
01:00:14,235 --> 01:00:16,195
told me his theory.

636
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:19,990
That's sad,
when patients get like that.

637
01:00:20,032 --> 01:00:21,659
They lose reality.

638
01:00:26,705 --> 01:00:29,542
Joseph, what the hell
are you doing?

639
01:00:29,625 --> 01:00:31,710
Oh, my God.

640
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:34,630
You don't believe.
I'll show you, you can't get hurt.

641
01:00:34,713 --> 01:00:38,551
That gun's not loaded. He doesn't know
where I keep the bullets.

642
01:00:38,592 --> 01:00:41,679
In your Rookie of the Year trophy.

643
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,557
Joseph, did you load that gun?

644
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,225
You won't get hurt.

645
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:49,520
- Elijah was wrong.
- When did he meet Elijah?

646
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:53,023
- He was with me when I met him.
- No one believes him.

647
01:00:53,065 --> 01:00:55,985
Joseph, listen to me.

648
01:00:56,068 --> 01:00:58,737
Sometimes when people
get sick or hurt

649
01:00:58,779 --> 01:01:02,700
for a long time, like Elijah,
their mind gets hurt too,

650
01:01:02,741 --> 01:01:05,411
and they start to think things
that aren't true.

651
01:01:05,494 --> 01:01:09,165
He told me what he thought
about your father. It isn't true.

652
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:10,666
I'll show you.

653
01:01:13,752 --> 01:01:16,005
Do you remember the story
about the boy

654
01:01:16,088 --> 01:01:17,840
that almost drowned in the pool?

655
01:01:17,923 --> 01:01:20,426
That was me they were
talking about. I almost died.

656
01:01:20,509 --> 01:01:22,219
- You're lying.
- I'm not lying.

657
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:23,679
I just didn't remember it.

658
01:01:23,762 --> 01:01:28,225
You know your father was injured in
college. You know. You know about that.

659
01:01:29,602 --> 01:01:30,769
Don't do it.

660
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:33,564
- He'll die, Joseph.
- I'll just shoot him once.

661
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:36,108
Joseph, listen to what your mot...

662
01:01:36,817 --> 01:01:38,611
Don't be scared.

663
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:42,031
Joseph,

664
01:01:42,114 --> 01:01:44,658
if you pull that trigger,
I'm going to leave.

665
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:47,995
Do you understand?
I'm going to go to New York.

666
01:01:48,078 --> 01:01:50,039
You're right.

667
01:01:50,122 --> 01:01:53,250
If you pull that trigger,
that bullet will bounce off me,

668
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:56,629
and I'm not going to be hurt,
but then I'm going to go upstairs

669
01:01:56,712 --> 01:02:00,382
and I'm going to pack and
I'm going to leave for New York.

670
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:01,759
Why?

671
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:05,679
Because I thought we were just
starting to be friends for real,

672
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:08,474
and friends will listen to each other.
They don't...

673
01:02:08,515 --> 01:02:11,644
And they don't shoot each other,
do they, Audrey?

674
01:02:11,727 --> 01:02:14,772
No shooting friends, Joseph.

675
01:02:14,813 --> 01:02:16,273
Joseph...

676
01:02:17,524 --> 01:02:20,319
you are about to be
in big trouble!

677
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:23,948
Now, I am your father,
and I am telling you

678
01:02:23,989 --> 01:02:27,159
to put that goddamn gun
down right now!

679
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:29,161
One!

680
01:02:29,203 --> 01:02:31,205
Two!

681
01:02:48,847 --> 01:02:52,601
I followed the guy
in the camouflage jacket.

682
01:02:53,352 --> 01:02:56,021
He had a silver gun
with a black grip

683
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:58,440
tucked in the back of his pants.

684
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:03,696
Were you really injured
in that car accident in college?

685
01:03:03,779 --> 01:03:05,447
Because I believe you faked it.

686
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:08,867
I believe you took the opportunity
to end your football career,

687
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:10,369
no questions asked.

688
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:13,998
And I think you did it,
of all things, for a woman.

689
01:03:14,039 --> 01:03:15,541
I guess that makes sense.

690
01:03:15,582 --> 01:03:19,461
Football's, what, just ten years,

691
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:21,213
but love...

692
01:03:21,255 --> 01:03:23,882
Hmm. Now, that's forever.

693
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:29,763
And that little bit of sadness
in the mornings you spoke of,

694
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:32,057
I think I know what that is.

695
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:35,311
Perhaps you're not doing
what you're supposed to be doing.

696
01:03:35,394 --> 01:03:37,396
Most guns have
a black or silver handle.

697
01:03:37,438 --> 01:03:39,815
I had a 50-50 shot
of getting the color right.

698
01:03:39,898 --> 01:03:42,860
- That's not what I witnessed.
- Stop.

699
01:03:42,901 --> 01:03:46,196
Stop messing with my life, Elijah.

700
01:03:46,238 --> 01:03:47,906
My son almost shot me last night

701
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:50,117
because he wanted to prove
you were right.

702
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,036
I never said you couldn't be killed.

703
01:03:52,077 --> 01:03:54,038
- I never said that.
- My wife was right.

704
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:56,665
There have been
three major disasters,

705
01:03:56,749 --> 01:03:59,001
and you were
the only one unharmed.

706
01:03:59,084 --> 01:04:01,003
I have been sick.

707
01:04:03,255 --> 01:04:05,591
When I was a kid,
I spent a week in the hospital

708
01:04:05,674 --> 01:04:09,386
getting better from pneumonia.
I almost drowned.

709
01:04:10,763 --> 01:04:14,016
Two skinny little kids were fooling
around in a pool dunking me,

710
01:04:14,099 --> 01:04:15,684
and I swallowed some water.

711
01:04:15,768 --> 01:04:18,729
They didn't know it,
and it almost killed me.

712
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:21,273
Heroes don't get killed like that.

713
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:23,275
Normal people do, right?

714
01:04:25,152 --> 01:04:29,615
I don't need to see you
anymore, OK?

715
01:04:29,698 --> 01:04:32,618
Please stay away from my family.

716
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:48,634
Hey, man, it's 20 after.
It's time to choose.

717
01:04:48,717 --> 01:04:50,761
I gotta head.

718
01:04:55,015 --> 01:04:58,685
You better not be jacking off to
the Japanese comics, I swear to God.

719
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:14,451
Look, man, I didn't know
you were in a...

720
01:05:16,787 --> 01:05:18,705
Just choose something, all right?

721
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:26,797
The baby-sitter's here.

722
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:32,678
- Should we cancel?
- I'm fine.

723
01:05:35,848 --> 01:05:38,559
We can do this another time.

724
01:05:38,642 --> 01:05:40,060
Don't lie.

725
01:05:42,813 --> 01:05:46,233
I'm fine. I just got mixed-up.

726
01:05:52,781 --> 01:05:56,827
How about we just go
for a couple drinks?

727
01:06:01,206 --> 01:06:03,625
OK, look, man,
I'm just gonna wheel you out.

728
01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:06,003
You can think about things
on the sidewalk.

729
01:06:06,044 --> 01:06:08,964
I got to get some chicken in me,
you know what I'm saying?

730
01:06:26,982 --> 01:06:28,692
Shit!

731
01:06:44,249 --> 01:06:45,501
Dude.

732
01:06:48,754 --> 01:06:52,758
I don't care if you are in a wheelchair.
If you do that again, I'm calling 5-0.

733
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:56,720
Man.

734
01:07:07,773 --> 01:07:11,610
That's it, crackerjack. You're gonna
be sitting your ass in jail now.

735
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,717
How much for this one?

736
01:07:38,679 --> 01:07:40,138
Rust?

737
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:41,974
Yeah.

738
01:07:42,057 --> 01:07:44,476
As a color, not as rust.

739
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,311
You know, like...

740
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:48,814
rust-colored paint or wood.

741
01:07:50,274 --> 01:07:51,984
- I didn't know that.
- Mm-hmm.

742
01:07:52,067 --> 01:07:53,652
Um...

743
01:07:53,735 --> 01:07:55,153
Mine's still brown.

744
01:07:56,446 --> 01:07:58,156
OK, my turn.

745
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,658
Favorite song?

746
01:08:00,867 --> 01:08:04,830
<i>Soft and Wet</i> by the Artist
Formerly Known as Prince.

747
01:08:04,913 --> 01:08:05,998
What?

748
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:10,252
We're supposed to be honest.

749
01:08:10,335 --> 01:08:12,838
<i>Soft and Wet.</i>

750
01:08:12,921 --> 01:08:16,592
- That's very interesting.
- OK, my turn.

751
01:08:18,302 --> 01:08:21,430
When was the first time...

752
01:08:22,514 --> 01:08:26,101
the thought popped into your head
we might not make it?

753
01:08:27,185 --> 01:08:29,062
That's not the game.

754
01:08:29,146 --> 01:08:32,774
It's the first date.
There aren't any rules.

755
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:38,030
Don't know for sure.

756
01:08:38,071 --> 01:08:39,531
Think carefully.

757
01:08:41,116 --> 01:08:43,118
What about the game?

758
01:08:43,201 --> 01:08:45,120
It's over. I won.

759
01:08:47,205 --> 01:08:49,374
Look, maybe it wasn't
a specific moment.

760
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:50,792
Maybe it was a time...

761
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:56,298
I had a nightmare one night, and...

762
01:08:56,381 --> 01:08:59,593
I didn't wake you up so you
could tell me that it was OK.

763
01:09:01,553 --> 01:09:03,555
I think that was the first time.

764
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:07,351
Does that count?

765
01:09:09,561 --> 01:09:10,979
That counts.

766
01:09:15,233 --> 01:09:19,029
Do you knowingly keep me
and Joseph at a distance?

767
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:28,246
Yes.

768
01:09:29,247 --> 01:09:31,166
Why?

769
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:35,045
I don't know.

770
01:09:39,883 --> 01:09:42,803
I just don't feel right, Audrey.

771
01:09:43,887 --> 01:09:45,097
Something's...

772
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:47,808
just not right.

773
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:52,396
Do you resent us, David?

774
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:56,441
Resent the life you have?

775
01:09:58,318 --> 01:10:02,114
There were a lot of other things
you could've done after college.

776
01:10:02,155 --> 01:10:04,116
These were your choices.

777
01:10:08,954 --> 01:10:11,623
Even if it meant
we couldn't have been together,

778
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:14,960
I never would've wished
that injury on you.

779
01:10:15,001 --> 01:10:18,964
What you could do physically
was a gift.

780
01:10:20,048 --> 01:10:23,218
I never would've wished it
to go away.

781
01:10:25,095 --> 01:10:27,013
You know that, right?

782
01:10:30,642 --> 01:10:32,811
You had two calls
after Joseph went to bed.

783
01:10:32,853 --> 01:10:36,314
One came through while I was on the
other line, but I wasn't talking long.

784
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:40,318
There was an emergency with my sister.
She tried to do a perm, and she looks...

785
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:42,487
Who called through?

786
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:43,613
Um...

787
01:10:43,655 --> 01:10:47,242
Someone from New York,
about a security job.

788
01:10:47,325 --> 01:10:48,493
They want to hire you.

789
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:50,829
I didn't know you guys
were moving to New York.

790
01:10:50,871 --> 01:10:52,456
Thanks for telling me.

791
01:10:52,497 --> 01:10:55,584
We weren't all gonna move.

792
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:57,919
Oh.

793
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:04,342
I let the answering machine
pick up the other call.

794
01:11:08,054 --> 01:11:09,306
Great.

795
01:11:21,651 --> 01:11:25,655
Look, let's just be honest here.
We're just at the beginning,

796
01:11:25,697 --> 01:11:28,658
and I don't expect you or I to change

797
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:31,077
the course of where our lives
were headed

798
01:11:31,161 --> 01:11:33,663
because of one date.

799
01:11:33,705 --> 01:11:35,665
And if you do go to New York,

800
01:11:35,707 --> 01:11:41,254
we can develop this.
We'll just be forced to take it slow.

801
01:11:41,338 --> 01:11:45,091
And in the end,
I think that's definitely better.

802
01:11:47,385 --> 01:11:49,304
This is our second time around, David.

803
01:11:49,387 --> 01:11:52,599
I didn't expect us to get
carried away, you know.

804
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:58,021
Then I guess "congratulations"
is the right thing to say.

805
01:12:22,462 --> 01:12:25,715
<i>David, it's Elijah.</i>

806
01:12:25,757 --> 01:12:29,761
<i>It was so obvious. It was this one issue
that brought it back for me...</i>

807
01:12:29,803 --> 01:12:33,682
Century Comics 117. <i>That's where</i>
<i>this group, the Coalition of Evil,</i>

808
01:12:33,765 --> 01:12:36,935
<i>tried to ascertain the weakness
of every superhero,</i>

809
01:12:37,018 --> 01:12:40,230
<i>because they all have one,
just like you.</i>

810
01:12:40,272 --> 01:12:43,191
<i>Your bones don't break. Mine do.</i>

811
01:12:43,275 --> 01:12:44,568
<i>That's clear.</i>

812
01:12:44,609 --> 01:12:48,113
<i>Your cells react to bacteria
and viruses differently than mine.</i>

813
01:12:48,154 --> 01:12:50,282
<i>You don't get sick. I do.</i>

814
01:12:50,323 --> 01:12:52,200
<i>That's also clear.</i>

815
01:12:52,284 --> 01:12:53,743
<i>But for some reason,</i>

816
01:12:53,785 --> 01:12:57,539
<i>you and I react
the exact same way to water.</i>

817
01:12:57,622 --> 01:12:59,916
<i>We swallow it too fast, we choke.</i>

818
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:02,377
<i>We get some in our lungs, we drown.</i>

819
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:07,424
<i>However unreal it may seem,
we are connected, you and I.</i>

820
01:13:07,465 --> 01:13:09,634
<i>We're on the same curve,</i>

821
01:13:09,676 --> 01:13:12,137
<i>just on opposite ends.</i>

822
01:13:12,178 --> 01:13:16,474
<i>The point of all this is we now know
something we didn't.</i>

823
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:18,643
<i>You have a weakness...</i>

824
01:13:18,685 --> 01:13:20,020
<i>water.</i>

825
01:13:20,103 --> 01:13:22,981
<i>It's like your kryptonite.</i>

826
01:13:23,064 --> 01:13:24,983
<i>You hearing me, David?</i>

827
01:15:40,326 --> 01:15:41,786
Audrey?

828
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:17,530
Gotcha.

829
01:16:17,614 --> 01:16:19,032
Come on.

830
01:16:35,715 --> 01:16:36,716
Audrey.

831
01:16:37,801 --> 01:16:38,802
Audrey.

832
01:16:44,641 --> 01:16:46,059
Hey!

833
01:16:50,605 --> 01:16:52,107
Audrey.

834
01:16:53,525 --> 01:16:54,943
What happened?

835
01:16:56,027 --> 01:16:57,487
What happened?

836
01:16:57,529 --> 01:16:58,905
I thought I was...

837
01:16:58,988 --> 01:17:01,407
I thought I was dead.

838
01:17:01,491 --> 01:17:02,909
Me too.

839
01:17:08,123 --> 01:17:09,958
Is she all right?

840
01:17:10,041 --> 01:17:12,585
I think her leg's broken.

841
01:17:12,669 --> 01:17:15,046
Are you hurt?

842
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:17,549
Hey, man, are you hurt?

843
01:17:47,704 --> 01:17:49,706
Hello?

844
01:17:49,747 --> 01:17:52,417
<i>I wasn't injured
in that car accident.</i>

845
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:53,585
David.

846
01:17:55,295 --> 01:17:58,256
<i>I've never been injured, Elijah.</i>

847
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:03,261
<i>What am I supposed to do?</i>

848
01:18:08,308 --> 01:18:10,560
Go to where people are.

849
01:18:11,352 --> 01:18:14,564
You won't have to look very long.

850
01:18:16,065 --> 01:18:19,110
It's all right to be afraid, David,

851
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:23,114
because this part
won't be like a comic book.

852
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:27,911
Real life doesn't fit into little boxes
that were drawn for it.

853
01:19:05,865 --> 01:19:07,992
There's one in the first row.

854
01:19:08,076 --> 01:19:10,536
It's... it's the second one.

855
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:13,331
Yes. It's the second one over.

856
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:49,117
Go back to Africa!

857
01:20:05,174 --> 01:20:06,426
Hey, what's your name?

858
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:15,893
I think you drank too much.

859
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:02,940
Can I come in?

860
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:04,442
Who are you?

861
01:21:05,526 --> 01:21:08,363
I like your house.

862
01:21:08,446 --> 01:21:10,323
Can I come in?

863
01:21:10,406 --> 01:21:11,824
What is this?

864
01:21:14,410 --> 01:21:17,789
No. You can't come in.

865
01:21:17,872 --> 01:21:19,290
Are you sure?

866
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:22,502
What... what are you...?

867
01:25:51,270 --> 01:25:54,065
It's OK.

868
01:26:04,950 --> 01:26:06,911
It's OK. It's OK.

869
01:26:19,173 --> 01:26:22,176
Shh, shh, shh...

870
01:32:50,814 --> 01:32:53,275
I had a bad dream.

871
01:32:59,323 --> 01:33:00,824
It's over now.

872
01:33:29,603 --> 01:33:31,522
I don't know.

873
01:33:32,731 --> 01:33:34,566
I can't believe you'd think that.

874
01:33:34,650 --> 01:33:36,652
I'm just asking you.

875
01:33:39,822 --> 01:33:41,740
I'm making French toast.

876
01:33:57,589 --> 01:34:01,218
I've been thinking about Elijah Price.

877
01:34:01,260 --> 01:34:05,097
If he shows up again, I think
we should call the police, OK?

878
01:34:09,059 --> 01:34:10,185
OK?

879
01:34:13,522 --> 01:34:14,648
OK.

880
01:35:23,634 --> 01:35:25,761
You were right.

881
01:36:15,394 --> 01:36:19,606
This is one of Johann Davis'
earliest drawings.

882
01:36:19,690 --> 01:36:22,025
See the villain's eyes?

883
01:36:22,109 --> 01:36:24,528
They're larger
than the other characters'.

884
01:36:24,569 --> 01:36:27,739
They insinuate a slightly
skewed perspective

885
01:36:27,823 --> 01:36:31,034
on how they see the world...

886
01:36:31,118 --> 01:36:33,370
just off normal.

887
01:36:33,412 --> 01:36:35,747
He doesn't look scary.

888
01:36:35,831 --> 01:36:40,877
Mm-hmm. That's what I said to my son,
but he says there's always two kinds.

889
01:36:40,961 --> 01:36:43,213
There's the soldier villain

890
01:36:43,255 --> 01:36:47,217
who fights the hero with his hands,
and then there's the real threat,

891
01:36:47,301 --> 01:36:50,220
the brilliant and evil archenemy

892
01:36:50,262 --> 01:36:52,889
who fights the hero with his mind.

893
01:36:52,973 --> 01:36:56,268
- Are you Elijah's mother?
- I am.

894
01:36:56,351 --> 01:36:58,562
I'm helping him with the sale.

895
01:36:58,645 --> 01:37:01,440
Nice to meet you.
I'm David Dunn.

896
01:37:01,523 --> 01:37:03,483
He's spoken of you.

897
01:37:03,567 --> 01:37:07,070
- Says you're becoming friends.
- We are.

898
01:37:08,322 --> 01:37:11,491
Looks like he's doing good today.

899
01:37:11,575 --> 01:37:14,411
I'm very proud of him.

900
01:37:14,494 --> 01:37:17,664
He's come through a lot in his life,

901
01:37:17,748 --> 01:37:21,335
a couple of bad spills
I thought had broken him.

902
01:37:21,418 --> 01:37:22,627
Mm-hmm.

903
01:37:22,711 --> 01:37:24,129
They were bad...

904
01:37:25,589 --> 01:37:28,175
but he made it.

905
01:37:28,258 --> 01:37:29,718
Yes, he did.

906
01:37:31,428 --> 01:37:33,847
He's kind of a miracle.

907
01:37:35,807 --> 01:37:37,309
Yes, he is.

908
01:37:41,188 --> 01:37:44,066
- I'll tell him you're here.
- Thank you.

909
01:38:13,970 --> 01:38:15,972
It has begun.

910
01:38:19,184 --> 01:38:21,144
Tell me something, David.

911
01:38:22,437 --> 01:38:24,648
When you woke up this morning,

912
01:38:24,731 --> 01:38:27,109
was it still there?

913
01:38:27,150 --> 01:38:28,610
The sadness?

914
01:38:29,945 --> 01:38:31,446
No.

915
01:38:35,617 --> 01:38:39,538
I think this is
where we shake hands.

916
01:38:59,307 --> 01:39:01,726
Did you see it?

917
01:39:10,026 --> 01:39:12,696
I worked in that building 25 years.

918
01:39:12,737 --> 01:39:15,198
I know all its secrets.

919
01:39:16,241 --> 01:39:17,576
Secrets?

920
01:39:19,828 --> 01:39:24,541
Like if there ever was a fire
on floors one, two or three,

921
01:39:24,624 --> 01:39:27,335
everyone in that hotel
would be burned alive.

922
01:39:34,342 --> 01:39:36,761
Passengers aren't allowed in there.

923
01:40:19,763 --> 01:40:23,016
Do you know
what the scariest thing is?

924
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:29,773
To not know your place in this world,

925
01:40:29,856 --> 01:40:34,611
to not know why you're here.
That's...

926
01:40:37,614 --> 01:40:39,824
That's just an awful feeling.

927
01:40:41,243 --> 01:40:43,453
What have you done?

928
01:40:44,621 --> 01:40:47,749
I almost gave up hope.

929
01:40:47,791 --> 01:40:51,169
There were so many times
I questioned myself.

930
01:40:51,253 --> 01:40:53,630
You killed all those people.

931
01:40:55,090 --> 01:40:57,801
But I found you.

932
01:40:57,884 --> 01:41:01,137
So many sacrifices...

933
01:41:02,472 --> 01:41:04,349
just to find you.

934
01:41:04,432 --> 01:41:06,017
Jesus Christ.

935
01:41:16,319 --> 01:41:20,073
Now that we know who you are,

936
01:41:20,156 --> 01:41:22,867
I know who I am.

937
01:41:26,454 --> 01:41:28,665
I'm not a mistake.

938
01:41:30,208 --> 01:41:32,335
It all makes sense.

939
01:41:32,419 --> 01:41:36,172
In a comic, you know how you can tell
who the arch-villain's going to be?

940
01:41:37,299 --> 01:41:40,677
He's the exact opposite of the hero,

941
01:41:40,719 --> 01:41:44,347
and most times, they're friends,
like you and me.

942
01:41:44,389 --> 01:41:48,351
I should've known way back when.
You know why, David?

943
01:41:48,393 --> 01:41:50,353
Because of the kids.

944
01:42:00,238 --> 01:42:03,241
They called me Mr. Glass.
