01
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,241
You've got a client.

02
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,169
I don't want to.

03
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,040
What?

04
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,481
Can't you get someone else?

05
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,767
He wants you.

06
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,042
But this customer is a pig.

07
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,208
He's waiting outside.

08
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,844
What did you do, huh?

09
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,169
What did you do to that customer?

10
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,169
Slavi, he hit me.

11
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,881
Understand.

12
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,529
Let's talk about you
not answering my calls.

13
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,160
Bitch!

14
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,170
Should we give him a card?

15
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,645
Don't be shy... Make the call.

16
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,211
Understand.

17
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,810
Why is that piece of shit
in my parking space?

18
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,443
- Are they upstairs?
- Yes.

19
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,885
Tevi. You collect
from that fuck, Dmitri?

20
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,650
Yes.

21
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,251
He asked for forgiveness.

252
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,090
Forgiveness?

22
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,646
I told him.

254
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,207
What am I, Jesus Christ?

23
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,966
You lost, dedushka?

24
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,606
- How the fuck did he get up here?
- I don't know.

25
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,411
Should I get rid of him?

26
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,681
No.

27
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,250
Can you believe this guy?

28
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,604
You know amerikantsy.


29
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,449
Be ready for business.

457
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,520
Of course, don't worry.

30
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:32,960
Good.

31
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,891
- Understand?
- It will all be well.

32
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,164
Keep digging-

33
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:12,602
We've searched the city.

34
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,211
No sign of him.

35
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:16,920
McCall has disappeared.

36
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,407
Mr. Pushkin has been notified.

37
01:39:55,160 --> 01:39:56,810
You're out of time.

38
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:06,529
It Will all be Well.

39
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:13,443
Go fuck yourself.

40
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:41,964
He's close. Get ready.

41
01:41:54,120 --> 01:41:55,485
Here comes the bus.

42
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:18,162
The bus is empty.

43
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:27,890
Kill one.

44
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:30,811
Kill one of them.

45
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:32,611
You wanna be first?

46
02:02:30,600 --> 02:02:32,967
Guards, guards!
