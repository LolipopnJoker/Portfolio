1
00:00:51,006 --> 00:00:53,410
There he is again.

2
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,522
Almost two decades and he still comes.

3
00:00:58,146 --> 00:00:59,146
So sad.

4
00:01:01,849 --> 00:01:04,118
How you doing, buddy?

5
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:07,193
Brought you all your favorite candies.

6
00:01:12,193 --> 00:01:14,995
Come on, Lloyd, you gotta get over her!

7
00:01:14,996 --> 00:01:16,800
Mary Samsonite was just a girl.

8
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,035
Besides, she's married.

9
00:01:21,036 --> 00:01:22,302
And even if it had worked out,

10
00:01:22,303 --> 00:01:25,139
would you really want ginger babies? Ugh.

11
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,140
Gross.

12
00:01:28,777 --> 00:01:30,611
Man, you gotta give me something!

13
00:01:43,158 --> 00:01:46,361
Lloyd,
I got something important to tell you.

14
00:01:47,361 --> 00:01:49,098
I can't come here anymore.

15
00:01:51,098 --> 00:01:55,304
I got kind of a serious medical problem.

16
00:01:58,173 --> 00:02:01,240
It's sort of complicated.

17
00:02:01,241 --> 00:02:05,181
Basically, I'm gonna be pretty
busy for the next few months.

18
00:02:07,181 --> 00:02:08,948
Anyway...

19
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:10,924
You're in good hands here. So...

20
00:02:15,924 --> 00:02:16,924
Take care, buddy.

21
00:02:22,062 --> 00:02:23,674
Lloyd, did you say something?

22
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,199
I got you.

23
00:02:29,571 --> 00:02:31,238
That's it, kid. You can do it.

24
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:33,406
Come on, come on, come on! Spit it out!

25
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:36,009
Got ya!

26
00:02:38,513 --> 00:02:40,948
What?

27
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:43,751
You should see the look on your face!

28
00:02:43,752 --> 00:02:46,487
I got you so good!

29
00:02:46,488 --> 00:02:48,922
Wait a second!

30
00:02:48,923 --> 00:02:52,425
Are you telling me that you
were faking for 20 years?

31
00:02:52,426 --> 00:02:54,161
Uh-huh.

32
00:02:54,162 --> 00:02:58,132
So you mean that you just wasted
the best years of your life?

33
00:02:58,133 --> 00:02:59,533
Out the window!

34
00:02:59,534 --> 00:03:04,171
And you let me come here every
Wednesday for, like, a thousand weeks,

35
00:03:04,172 --> 00:03:05,839
and it was all just for a gag?

36
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,007
Uh-huh.

37
00:03:08,008 --> 00:03:09,876
That's

38
00:03:09,877 --> 00:03:10,877
awesome!

39
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:12,246
I know!

40
00:03:12,247 --> 00:03:15,948
You gotta admit,
I totally had you suckered, didn't I?

41
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:17,338
Hook, line and sphincter!

42
00:03:18,353 --> 00:03:22,055
- Oh, oh.
- Oh! Oh, oh. Oh.

43
00:03:22,056 --> 00:03:24,525
Legs are a little rubbery after
all that time sitting here.

44
00:03:24,526 --> 00:03:25,692
Why don't you roll me inside?

45
00:03:25,693 --> 00:03:27,693
We'll get the nurse to take
the catheter out of me.

46
00:03:27,694 --> 00:03:28,362
Oh.

47
00:03:28,363 --> 00:03:30,898
I wanna see if my lizard's
still spitting straight.

48
00:03:30,899 --> 00:03:33,366
We don't need nurses for that.
I know how to do it.

49
00:03:33,367 --> 00:03:34,701
But don't you have to...

50
00:03:37,504 --> 00:03:39,038
Oh, God!

51
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:41,007
That thing's really taken root!

52
00:03:41,008 --> 00:03:42,341
Hey, fellas!

53
00:03:42,342 --> 00:03:44,231
- Give me a hand over here.
- <i>Sí.</i>

54
00:03:46,381 --> 00:03:48,549
<i>Yankos los</i> pee-pee.

55
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,417
Are you sure about this, Har?

56
00:03:50,418 --> 00:03:52,386
Usually,
doctors like to do this sort of thing.

57
00:03:52,387 --> 00:03:54,388
Oh, that's just for insurance purposes.

58
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:56,557
On three. Three!

59
00:04:05,132 --> 00:04:07,467
You are a fricking genius, Lloyd!

60
00:04:07,468 --> 00:04:09,335
I mean,
nobody else could have pulled that off!

61
00:04:09,336 --> 00:04:10,436
- Eh!
- Nobody!

62
00:04:10,437 --> 00:04:14,208
I mean, the shock treatments,
the partial lobotomy!

63
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:16,110
- That's commitment!
- Yeah.

64
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,412
It broke up the monotony.

65
00:04:18,413 --> 00:04:20,013
One thing I don't get, though.

66
00:04:20,014 --> 00:04:22,415
Why did you play it out for 20 whole years?

67
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,852
Because it wouldn't have been
funny if I stopped too soon.

68
00:04:24,853 --> 00:04:26,321
Comedy is all about timing, Har.

69
00:04:26,521 --> 00:04:30,123
Yeah, but wouldn't it still have been
funny if you quit after 10 years?

70
00:04:30,124 --> 00:04:32,092
Oh, definitely. But not as!

71
00:04:32,093 --> 00:04:34,328
Whoa!

72
00:04:34,329 --> 00:04:35,862
Pretty bird.

73
00:04:35,863 --> 00:04:38,198
- Crap on toast!
- Pretty bird.

74
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:40,434
- Is that grown-up Billy in 4-C?
- Uh-huh.

75
00:04:40,435 --> 00:04:42,369
Come on, Siskel, give me a movie quote.

76
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,338
What did they say in <i>Jerry Maguire?</i>

77
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:45,939
"You had me at hello."

78
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,207
Um, <i>Titanic?</i>

79
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,941
"I'm king of the world."

80
00:04:48,942 --> 00:04:51,044
Good job!

81
00:04:51,045 --> 00:04:52,212
We better tiptoe past him.

82
00:04:52,213 --> 00:04:54,147
Oh, no, you can't tiptoe past a blindy.

83
00:04:54,148 --> 00:04:55,417
Their hearing's too good.

84
00:04:55,617 --> 00:04:57,083
- What?
- Mmm-hmm.

85
00:04:57,084 --> 00:04:59,052
That's just an old wives' tale.

86
00:04:59,053 --> 00:05:01,254
Like women shouldn't
smoke during pregnancy.

87
00:05:01,255 --> 00:05:04,458
I turned out fine.
My mom smoked like a chimney.

88
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:06,059
Especially when she was drinking!

89
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,326
Whatever. Doesn't matter.

90
00:05:07,327 --> 00:05:08,929
Billy's over the whole Petey thing.

91
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:09,996
You should see his apartment.

92
00:05:09,997 --> 00:05:12,609
He's got the best rare
bird collection in Rhody!

93
00:05:14,002 --> 00:05:15,469
I gotta see this.

94
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,940
Hey, Billy!

95
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,107
I hear you got a lot of flocking birds.

96
00:05:24,646 --> 00:05:26,646
Is that you, Lloyd?

97
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:29,482
Very good.

98
00:05:29,483 --> 00:05:32,251
I didn't think you'd recognize
me after all these years.

99
00:05:32,252 --> 00:05:33,953
So what have you been up to, buddy boy?

100
00:05:33,954 --> 00:05:35,510
Seen any good movies lately?

101
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,659
I mean, you know, like...

102
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,495
On the radio?

103
00:05:41,495 --> 00:05:43,330
What was that?

104
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:45,465
- Did you just feed them something?
- Relax.

105
00:05:45,466 --> 00:05:46,967
It's just a little candy.

106
00:05:46,968 --> 00:05:48,302
You can't feed candy to birds!

107
00:05:48,303 --> 00:05:49,936
Their stomachs will explode!

108
00:05:49,937 --> 00:05:51,405
Even if it's just a few Pop Rocks?

109
00:05:51,406 --> 00:05:53,941
Are you crazy? Pick those up!

110
00:05:53,942 --> 00:05:55,708
- Pick them up!
- All right, all right!

111
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:57,346
Sheesh.

112
00:05:59,346 --> 00:06:01,347
Well, nice catching up.

113
00:06:01,348 --> 00:06:03,150
See you later.

114
00:06:03,151 --> 00:06:04,318
Not if I see you first!

115
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,119
Ha-ha! Good one!

116
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,389
No, no, no, it's okay, Siskel.

117
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:12,225
Daddy's not gonna let him
get anywhere near you.

118
00:06:12,226 --> 00:06:14,594
Booga!

119
00:06:14,595 --> 00:06:16,629
See? I told you that hearing thing

120
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,630
was a wives' tale.

121
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:21,036
Oh, yeah!

122
00:06:22,036 --> 00:06:24,139
- Hey, who's this?
- Ah.

123
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:26,172
That's Butthole.

124
00:06:26,173 --> 00:06:27,307
I found him out in the
alley a couple years ago.

125
00:06:27,507 --> 00:06:29,563
- Why did you name him Butthole?
- Oh.

126
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,345
Because of this.

127
00:06:32,346 --> 00:06:34,147
Oh, yeah. Good name.

128
00:06:34,148 --> 00:06:35,351
Totally fits.

129
00:06:36,351 --> 00:06:38,618
I like what you've done with the place.

130
00:06:38,619 --> 00:06:40,453
Nice cappuccino machine.

131
00:06:40,454 --> 00:06:41,655
Who's the astronaut?

132
00:06:41,656 --> 00:06:43,290
Oh, that's my roommate.

133
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,157
Roommate?

134
00:06:45,158 --> 00:06:46,326
You got a new roommate?

135
00:06:46,526 --> 00:06:48,729
I had to get somebody to
pay your half of the rent

136
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,453
while you were in the hospital.

137
00:06:51,031 --> 00:06:52,599
How's it going, Ice Pick?

138
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,156
Best day ever.
Greatest day of my life, really.

139
00:06:56,993 --> 00:06:58,438
Pick cooks up a rock candy

140
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,705
that will make you dizzy.

141
00:06:59,706 --> 00:07:02,075
Folks come from all over
the city to buy it.

142
00:07:02,076 --> 00:07:04,177
It's burning my eyes.

143
00:07:04,178 --> 00:07:05,290
Must be Cajun style.

144
00:07:06,704 --> 00:07:10,316
So what's this serious medical
problem you've been blabbing about?

145
00:07:10,317 --> 00:07:11,540
And it better be good.

146
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,391
Lloyd, there's something...

147
00:07:15,591 --> 00:07:17,058
I've known about this for a while,

148
00:07:17,059 --> 00:07:18,671
but I didn't wanna worry you.

149
00:07:19,226 --> 00:07:21,226
Mmm-hmm?

150
00:07:21,396 --> 00:07:23,499
I need a kidney transplant.

151
00:07:24,499 --> 00:07:27,167
No way! Really?

152
00:07:27,168 --> 00:07:28,568
Wow.

153
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:30,136
So what do you wanna do for dinner tonight?

154
00:07:30,137 --> 00:07:31,772
Wanna hit Haven Brothers?

155
00:07:31,773 --> 00:07:34,441
I could eat the mud-hole
out of a dead skunk!

156
00:07:34,442 --> 00:07:36,309
Are you not listening to me, Lloyd?

157
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,645
Getting a new kidney is a really big deal.

158
00:07:38,646 --> 00:07:42,349
There's waiting lists,
lots and lots of forms to fill out,

159
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:45,628
and if I can't find another kidney
real soon, I'm dead meat.

160
00:07:47,055 --> 00:07:48,055
Yeah, well,

161
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:51,657
maybe, just maybe,

162
00:07:51,658 --> 00:07:55,227
there's a person out there
who cares about you so much

163
00:07:55,228 --> 00:07:56,729
that said person would be willing

164
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:00,066
to give up a little piece of
himself to save your life.

165
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:02,436
Really, Lloyd? You'd do that?

166
00:08:02,437 --> 00:08:06,073
Me? Yeah, right! Nice try!

167
00:08:06,074 --> 00:08:07,710
- The nerve!
- Oh.

168
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,412
I mean, I would, in a New York heartbeat.

169
00:08:13,413 --> 00:08:14,781
I'm just not a urine match.

170
00:08:14,782 --> 00:08:17,060
My wizz doesn't get all sudsy like yours.

171
00:08:17,652 --> 00:08:19,288
Ow.

172
00:08:20,288 --> 00:08:23,255
Wait. Don't panic.

173
00:08:23,256 --> 00:08:25,256
I know exactly what we gotta do.

174
00:08:27,606 --> 00:08:29,329
I don't know about this, Lloyd.

175
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,830
I haven't been home in over 20 years.

176
00:08:30,831 --> 00:08:31,831
Come on, Harry!

177
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:34,201
You need a genital organ match.

178
00:08:34,202 --> 00:08:35,668
They're your parents.

179
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:37,403
I'm not gonna go crawling back to them,
Lloyd.

180
00:08:37,404 --> 00:08:38,672
Not after what they did to me.

181
00:08:38,673 --> 00:08:40,106
What did they do?

182
00:08:40,107 --> 00:08:41,707
They threw me out of the house.

183
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:44,344
- Why?
- Just because I told them I was gay.

184
00:08:44,345 --> 00:08:47,180
- Why did you tell them that?
- I was sick of mowing the lawn.

185
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:48,547
Oh, yeah.

186
00:08:48,548 --> 00:08:51,118
Well, I don't see what choice you have.

187
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:52,451
You either go home and face the music

188
00:08:52,452 --> 00:08:54,687
or you suffocate in your own pee.

189
00:08:54,688 --> 00:08:56,223
Yeah, I guess you're right.

190
00:08:56,224 --> 00:08:57,356
Okay, let's do this.

191
00:08:57,357 --> 00:08:59,162
All right. Hop on.

192
00:09:01,162 --> 00:09:02,662
Engage super thrusters!

193
00:09:02,663 --> 00:09:04,197
Don't, Lloyd!

194
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:08,304
Pardon me, Harry.

195
00:09:20,214 --> 00:09:21,214
Here we are.

196
00:09:22,319 --> 00:09:24,319
Place looks smaller than I remember.

197
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:25,652
Oh, yeah.

198
00:09:25,653 --> 00:09:26,853
Wow.

199
00:09:26,854 --> 00:09:28,922
Lot of memories on this street.

200
00:09:28,923 --> 00:09:31,191
Yeah.

201
00:09:31,192 --> 00:09:33,859
Remember when we pulled up on the bike
and parked it a couple seconds ago?

202
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,162
Yeah, that was cool.

203
00:09:35,163 --> 00:09:37,497
Oh, those were the days.

204
00:09:37,498 --> 00:09:38,632
I remember one afternoon,

205
00:09:38,633 --> 00:09:40,399
it was the first day of spring,

206
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,569
the flowers were blooming,
the sun was shining

207
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,204
and you and I were doing cartwheels

208
00:09:44,205 --> 00:09:45,404
right down that hill over there.

209
00:09:45,405 --> 00:09:46,840
Yeah, I remember that!

210
00:09:46,841 --> 00:09:49,397
- We were in your dad's Lincoln, right?
- Yeah.

211
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:54,324
You totally lost it when
I yanked the wheel.

212
00:10:03,323 --> 00:10:05,325
Come on! Pick it up!

213
00:10:05,326 --> 00:10:07,596
Show a little hustle in there!

214
00:10:12,265 --> 00:10:15,569
Wow. Rong time, Harry!

215
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,470
Oh, sorry. We'll come back later.

216
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,406
- Hey!
- No, no, no! I mean,

217
00:10:19,407 --> 00:10:21,941
rong time, no see.

218
00:10:21,942 --> 00:10:22,942
Oh.

219
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,378
Where you been?

220
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:26,779
Come! Come in!

221
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,885
- Oh!
- Thanks, Dad.

222
00:10:31,885 --> 00:10:33,119
So you see,

223
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,623
my best hope for a donor match
is with a blood relative.

224
00:10:36,624 --> 00:10:37,993
Family.

225
00:10:40,428 --> 00:10:42,963
Harry, you not touch your peanut butter.

226
00:10:42,964 --> 00:10:45,331
Oh, that's okay. I'm not very hungry, Dad.

227
00:10:45,332 --> 00:10:46,865
When Harry young,

228
00:10:46,866 --> 00:10:49,768
oh, boy, he loves the peanut butter.

229
00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:51,403
Oh.

230
00:10:51,404 --> 00:10:52,906
Three jar a week disappear!

231
00:10:52,907 --> 00:10:54,173
Good to know.

232
00:10:54,174 --> 00:10:57,644
So anyway, which one of you
two's gonna cough up a kidney?

233
00:11:01,548 --> 00:11:03,652
What? What was that?

234
00:11:04,652 --> 00:11:05,686
Wait!

235
00:11:05,687 --> 00:11:08,287
I know! You're the gopher from <i>Caddyshack.</i>

236
00:11:08,288 --> 00:11:10,422
Look at her! She's got it down!

237
00:11:10,423 --> 00:11:12,725
We love you, Harry.

238
00:11:12,726 --> 00:11:14,726
Do you love him long time?

239
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:19,075
But you know you're not
our real son, right?

240
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,336
You adopted.

241
00:11:22,336 --> 00:11:23,336
Ouch.

242
00:11:29,943 --> 00:11:31,332
Dad, what are you saying?

243
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,879
Sorry, Harry.

244
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,992
We thought you know.

245
00:11:36,951 --> 00:11:38,317
Wow.

246
00:11:38,318 --> 00:11:39,786
What a nut punch.

247
00:11:39,787 --> 00:11:41,153
Don't be glum, Har.

248
00:11:41,154 --> 00:11:44,291
All this means is that your real
parents are out there somewhere.

249
00:11:44,292 --> 00:11:45,691
And I will go to the
ends of the earth to...

250
00:11:45,692 --> 00:11:46,993
Real parents dead.

251
00:11:46,994 --> 00:11:47,994
You're boned.

252
00:11:50,798 --> 00:11:52,533
James boned.

253
00:11:53,533 --> 00:11:55,436
Harry, Harry.

254
00:12:05,178 --> 00:12:08,415
No idea what you're saying,
Ma, but right back at you.

255
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:12,018
Harry, before you go,
your mail piling up for many year.

256
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:13,756
- Oh.
- We saving for you.

257
00:12:16,756 --> 00:12:19,594
Huh. Junk mail, junk mail.

258
00:12:21,796 --> 00:12:23,963
I got accepted to Arizona State.

259
00:12:23,964 --> 00:12:25,031
Hmm?

260
00:12:25,032 --> 00:12:27,367
Oh, look at this.

261
00:12:27,368 --> 00:12:29,402
It's a postcard from Fraida Felcher.

262
00:12:29,403 --> 00:12:30,737
The chick from Cranston?

263
00:12:30,738 --> 00:12:31,738
Ooh!

264
00:12:33,707 --> 00:12:35,975
So, what'd she have to say?

265
00:12:35,976 --> 00:12:38,677
"Harry, I'm pregnant. Please call me."

266
00:12:38,678 --> 00:12:41,413
Lloyd, I'm gonna be a dad!

267
00:12:41,414 --> 00:12:42,750
No way!

268
00:12:45,653 --> 00:12:46,952
Look at the postmark.

269
00:12:46,953 --> 00:12:48,620
1991.

270
00:12:48,621 --> 00:12:50,456
Do you know what this means, Harry?

271
00:12:50,457 --> 00:12:52,591
- You have a grown kid.
- Oh.

272
00:12:52,592 --> 00:12:53,648
With grown kidneys.

273
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,034
But, Lloyd,
we don't have a phone number or address,

274
00:13:02,035 --> 00:13:04,637
or nothing. And who we fooling?

275
00:13:04,638 --> 00:13:07,005
Even if I find him, my kid's never met me.

276
00:13:07,006 --> 00:13:09,375
Why would he wanna give me a kidney?

277
00:13:09,376 --> 00:13:11,610
Are you serious?

278
00:13:11,611 --> 00:13:13,479
After all you've done for him?

279
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,415
It's the least he can do.

280
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,119
What have I ever done for him?

281
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:20,286
You gave him his space. Kids love that.

282
00:13:21,922 --> 00:13:24,891
I didn't wanna be a helicopter parent.

283
00:13:24,892 --> 00:13:26,459
And you filled him with wonder.

284
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,894
- Wonder?
- Yeah.

285
00:13:28,895 --> 00:13:31,118
Like, "I wonder who my deadbeat dad is?"

286
00:13:32,866 --> 00:13:34,033
Oh, it's okay, Lloyd.

287
00:13:35,635 --> 00:13:37,139
I've had a full life.

288
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:40,105
I was a paperboy for a week.

289
00:13:40,106 --> 00:13:42,441
I fathered a child.

290
00:13:42,442 --> 00:13:44,778
I've seen every episode of <i>Full House.</i>

291
00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:45,979
Wow!

292
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,081
Every episode?

293
00:13:48,081 --> 00:13:49,749
Okay, okay.

294
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,306
So how are we gonna do this?

295
00:13:51,987 --> 00:13:53,987
If we find Fraida, we find your kid.

296
00:13:53,988 --> 00:13:55,356
If we find your kid, we find your kidney.

297
00:13:55,556 --> 00:13:57,090
Simple.

298
00:13:57,091 --> 00:13:59,426
Yeah,
but I never even knew where Fraida lived.

299
00:13:59,427 --> 00:14:02,761
I didn't have a car.
She always had to pick me up in her van.

300
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,798
Didn't you meet her through Pete Stainer?

301
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:07,834
- Who?
- Pee-Stain!

302
00:14:07,835 --> 00:14:09,768
He'll know how to reach her.

303
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:12,604
Yeah, but I haven't talked to
Pee-Stain in a hundred years!

304
00:14:12,605 --> 00:14:14,706
I can't drop by his house
in the middle of the night

305
00:14:14,707 --> 00:14:16,707
and ask him for some chick's number.

306
00:14:17,977 --> 00:14:19,845
Sure you can!

307
00:14:19,846 --> 00:14:22,850
Oh, okay. But we gotta
be sub-tull about it.

308
00:14:24,385 --> 00:14:26,552
The word is pronounced "subtle," Harry.

309
00:14:26,553 --> 00:14:28,089
It's a silent "B."

310
00:14:31,524 --> 00:14:32,658
What was that for?

311
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:34,048
You had a gah-nat on you.

312
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:38,630
Maybe we should catch a
bus to Pee-Stain's house.

313
00:14:38,631 --> 00:14:40,200
We can't. We got the bike.

314
00:14:40,201 --> 00:14:43,202
Oh, that's okay. They got bike
racks on the front of buses now.

315
00:14:43,203 --> 00:14:44,203
Cool.

316
00:14:49,677 --> 00:14:50,745
Perfect.

317
00:14:51,745 --> 00:14:53,023
That's very convenient.

318
00:14:55,682 --> 00:14:57,050
Hey, guys!

319
00:14:57,051 --> 00:14:58,917
You forgot your bike!

320
00:14:58,918 --> 00:15:02,055
Oh, it's not ours. Somebody
abandoned it in front of our place.

321
00:15:02,056 --> 00:15:05,596
Yeah. Just left it there
double-chained to a tree.

322
00:15:09,596 --> 00:15:11,096
Hey, Har.

323
00:15:11,097 --> 00:15:12,699
You wanna hear the second most
annoying sound in the world?

324
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,868
Sure.

325
00:15:21,464 --> 00:15:23,076
Yeah, that's pretty annoying.

326
00:15:23,077 --> 00:15:24,576
No, not that.

327
00:15:24,577 --> 00:15:25,811
What the hell are you doing

328
00:15:25,812 --> 00:15:27,846
ringing our doorbell like that
in the middle of the night?

329
00:15:27,847 --> 00:15:28,918
That!

330
00:15:30,918 --> 00:15:33,307
Mr. Stainer. Mrs. Stainer. Nice to see you.

331
00:15:33,953 --> 00:15:35,787
Harry, Lloyd.

332
00:15:35,788 --> 00:15:38,957
To what do we owe the honor
at this late hour, gentlemen?

333
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,659
We were just wondering if Pee-Stain

334
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,595
wanted to come out for some suds.

335
00:15:42,596 --> 00:15:43,897
And maybe have his ass handed to him

336
00:15:43,898 --> 00:15:45,732
in a couple of games of <i>Dig Dug.</i>

337
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,102
Lloyd.

338
00:15:49,102 --> 00:15:50,102
Peter is dead.

339
00:15:51,971 --> 00:15:53,971
Yeah, right. Since when?

340
00:15:55,075 --> 00:15:57,779
Since 1991. Remember?

341
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:00,148
The motorcycle accident?

342
00:16:01,148 --> 00:16:03,316
But I thought he pulled through.

343
00:16:03,317 --> 00:16:06,154
The obituary said he was
survived by his parents.

344
00:16:07,154 --> 00:16:09,990
Uh, no. He did not pull through.

345
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,126
Are you sure?

346
00:16:13,126 --> 00:16:14,126
Yes.

347
00:16:16,663 --> 00:16:18,767
Oh, yeah.

348
00:16:19,767 --> 00:16:22,034
You guys are right.

349
00:16:22,035 --> 00:16:25,004
Anyway. Sorry about that whole thing.

350
00:16:25,005 --> 00:16:26,973
Pee-Stain and I were very close friends.

351
00:16:26,974 --> 00:16:28,707
Yeah, we know.

352
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,909
You're the one who sold him the motorcycle.

353
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,144
And if I recall,

354
00:16:32,145 --> 00:16:33,812
I made him a sweet deal.

355
00:16:33,813 --> 00:16:36,081
My bike for his helmet, straight up.

356
00:16:36,082 --> 00:16:38,183
That thing was a rocket.

357
00:16:38,184 --> 00:16:39,786
A little squirrelly on the corners,

358
00:16:39,787 --> 00:16:41,153
but when you got it on a straightaway...

359
00:16:41,154 --> 00:16:43,210
Good night, Lloyd. Good night, Harry.

360
00:16:48,628 --> 00:16:49,729
That was awkward.

361
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,631
You're not kidding.

362
00:16:51,632 --> 00:16:53,900
When somebody comes to
your door at 3:00 a.m.,

363
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:55,768
put some pants on!

364
00:16:55,769 --> 00:16:57,170
Hey, wait a second.

365
00:16:57,171 --> 00:16:59,172
That's where I met Fraida Felcher.

366
00:16:59,173 --> 00:17:02,810
She worked at the funeral parlor
where they buried Pee-Stain.

367
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:04,810
Wow.

368
00:17:05,712 --> 00:17:07,980
Think about it.

369
00:17:07,981 --> 00:17:11,084
If I hadn't sold that
crotch rocket to Pee-Stain,

370
00:17:11,085 --> 00:17:12,352
you wouldn't have a bastard child

371
00:17:12,353 --> 00:17:13,853
who's gonna save your life.

372
00:17:15,823 --> 00:17:18,324
God's got a pretty warped sense of humor,
huh?

373
00:17:18,325 --> 00:17:21,693
Yeah. I bet he smokes weed.

374
00:17:21,694 --> 00:17:24,029
Otherwise, why would he put our
testicles outside our bodies

375
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,586
where someone could do this?

376
00:17:41,749 --> 00:17:42,749
Ow!

377
00:17:43,349 --> 00:17:44,817
Bush club!

378
00:17:46,252 --> 00:17:47,922
What are you doing, Lloyd?

379
00:17:48,922 --> 00:17:50,757
I'm about to meet my kid!

380
00:17:50,758 --> 00:17:52,091
Sorry, Har.

381
00:17:52,092 --> 00:17:54,537
Bushes like that don't
come along every day.

382
00:18:00,067 --> 00:18:02,705
Excuse me, sir. Is Fraida working today?

383
00:18:05,705 --> 00:18:07,039
- I'm Fraida.
- Oh.

384
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,674
Sorry for the confusion.

385
00:18:08,675 --> 00:18:11,244
We meant your smoking-hot daughter,
Fraida Junior.

386
00:18:11,444 --> 00:18:14,247
There is no Fraida Junior.

387
00:18:14,248 --> 00:18:16,281
I'm the only Fraida in the family.

388
00:18:16,282 --> 00:18:19,685
That little hottie must
have given us a fake name.

389
00:18:19,686 --> 00:18:21,421
Look, guys, it's me,

390
00:18:21,422 --> 00:18:22,788
Fraida Felcher.

391
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:24,191
Yeah, right.

392
00:18:24,192 --> 00:18:27,759
Like we'd be fighting
over those blowfish jowls.

393
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,062
No offense.

394
00:18:29,063 --> 00:18:30,063
Harry.

395
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:31,732
Lloyd.

396
00:18:32,732 --> 00:18:34,566
I'm gonna say this one more time.

397
00:18:35,068 --> 00:18:36,272
I'm Fraida.

398
00:18:39,272 --> 00:18:41,274
- Tattoo.
- Oh, yeah?

399
00:18:41,275 --> 00:18:43,442
- Then show us your tattoo.
- Mmm-hmm.

400
00:18:43,443 --> 00:18:45,978
Because Fraida had a cute
little smiley face on her back

401
00:18:45,979 --> 00:18:47,948
right above her bikini line.

402
00:18:55,756 --> 00:18:57,132
Well?

403
00:19:05,132 --> 00:19:06,865
Hmm.

404
00:19:06,866 --> 00:19:08,069
- It's close.
- Mmm.

405
00:19:10,069 --> 00:19:11,470
Oh. Hi, Fraida.

406
00:19:11,471 --> 00:19:13,239
Oh, hey! How you been?

407
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,341
Have you been doing yoga?

408
00:19:15,342 --> 00:19:18,620
Yeah, I'm kind of busy.
Is there a reason you guys are here?

409
00:19:19,113 --> 00:19:20,779
Yes.

410
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:24,119
I just received this postcard
that you sent me 22 years ago.

411
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:28,119
Talk about snail mail.

412
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,181
You better come in.

413
00:19:38,898 --> 00:19:41,534
So, did you, uh, ever have the baby?

414
00:19:41,535 --> 00:19:43,535
I had a daughter. Named her Fanny.

415
00:19:44,037 --> 00:19:46,005
You hear that, Har? A little girl.

416
00:19:46,006 --> 00:19:48,240
- Fanny Felcher!
- Ow!

417
00:19:48,241 --> 00:19:50,242
- Are you all right?
- Uh, bad back.

418
00:19:50,243 --> 00:19:53,813
- Oh, I have so many questions for you.
- Like?

419
00:19:53,814 --> 00:19:56,047
For starters, how was the pregnancy?

420
00:19:56,048 --> 00:19:58,951
Was it a tough one?
Did they have to saw you open?

421
00:19:58,952 --> 00:20:01,386
Whoa, Har. Dial it down!

422
00:20:01,387 --> 00:20:03,456
We're talking about the
miracle of childbirth here.

423
00:20:03,457 --> 00:20:05,857
What my insensitive friend meant was,

424
00:20:05,858 --> 00:20:07,192
did you have a C-section

425
00:20:07,528 --> 00:20:10,566
or were you able to have
the baby <i>au snatch-urel?</i>

426
00:20:12,566 --> 00:20:14,941
It went smoothly.

427
00:20:20,941 --> 00:20:22,108
So, uh, where is she?

428
00:20:23,876 --> 00:20:25,444
Can I meet her?

429
00:20:26,547 --> 00:20:28,047
I gave her up for adoption.

430
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:30,553
What?

431
00:20:32,553 --> 00:20:35,287
- Why?
- Because I was broke and scared.

432
00:20:35,288 --> 00:20:38,024
I regretted it as soon as I did it.

433
00:20:38,025 --> 00:20:39,892
But it was too late.

434
00:20:39,893 --> 00:20:42,162
I'd already signed away all my rights.

435
00:20:43,219 --> 00:20:44,497
Then a couple years ago

436
00:20:44,498 --> 00:20:46,233
I wrote her a letter.

437
00:20:47,233 --> 00:20:48,789
But she never wrote me back.

438
00:20:49,603 --> 00:20:50,603
Wait here.

439
00:20:52,172 --> 00:20:54,406
What do we do now?

440
00:20:54,407 --> 00:20:57,076
What do you mean, "What do we do now?"

441
00:20:57,077 --> 00:20:59,245
I mean, at this exact moment in time,
what do we do?

442
00:20:59,246 --> 00:21:01,012
Harry, don't you hear that?

443
00:21:01,013 --> 00:21:02,316
It's the fat lady singing.

444
00:21:02,516 --> 00:21:04,549
It's over!

445
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,919
I need something to drink.

446
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,621
- But...
- Harry, enough!

447
00:21:08,622 --> 00:21:10,189
We tried and we failed!

448
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,024
As Vince Lombardi used to say,

449
00:21:12,025 --> 00:21:14,259
you gotta know when to quit!

450
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,629
Hey, you should pick out one of
those coffins while we're here.

451
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,463
- What if...
- Darn it, Har!

452
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:21,566
I cannot live on this emotional
roller coaster any longer.

453
00:21:21,567 --> 00:21:23,903
I feel bad saying it,
but you're slunk meat.

454
00:21:23,904 --> 00:21:26,460
Here's a picture I found
of my daughter online.

455
00:21:37,384 --> 00:21:39,552
Or, we could suck it up,

456
00:21:39,553 --> 00:21:40,987
pick ourselves up by our bootstraps

457
00:21:40,988 --> 00:21:42,988
and go find that little girl!

458
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,725
Hold on.

459
00:21:45,726 --> 00:21:47,993
You wrote her a letter.
You must know where she lives!

460
00:21:47,994 --> 00:21:52,198
Yeah. I tracked her down through
this adoption search site.

461
00:21:52,199 --> 00:21:54,432
She was raised by this hotshot scientist.

462
00:21:54,433 --> 00:21:57,269
Why didn't you just go find her in person?

463
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,437
If she doesn't want to meet me,

464
00:21:58,438 --> 00:22:01,106
I am not going to force myself on her.

465
00:22:01,107 --> 00:22:03,041
Maybe she didn't get your letter.

466
00:22:03,042 --> 00:22:04,346
She got it, all right.

467
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:08,346
What if we go track her down for you?

468
00:22:08,347 --> 00:22:10,082
There's no lawsuit against that.

469
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:11,483
Are you guys serious?

470
00:22:11,484 --> 00:22:13,318
You'd help me out?

471
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:15,254
Of course we'll help you out.

472
00:22:15,255 --> 00:22:17,323
We're gonna need some wheels.
I'll lend you a car.

473
00:22:17,324 --> 00:22:18,391
Then it's done.

474
00:22:18,392 --> 00:22:21,559
Yeah, using this address
and our superior instincts,

475
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,261
you and your little girl
are gonna be having

476
00:22:23,262 --> 00:22:24,697
a family reunion in no time.

477
00:22:24,698 --> 00:22:26,298
Cheers!

478
00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:28,188
Whoa! Wait. Where did you get that?

479
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,068
The Slurpee machine in the back.

480
00:22:30,069 --> 00:22:31,347
That's embalming fluid.

481
00:22:32,271 --> 00:22:33,271
Oh.

482
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,441
Does it have aspartame?

483
00:22:35,442 --> 00:22:36,976
No.

484
00:22:36,977 --> 00:22:38,017
Cool.

485
00:22:50,557 --> 00:22:52,332
Hey, guys, check this out!

486
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:15,647
What about the blue roads
with the big numbers?

487
00:23:15,648 --> 00:23:16,749
Those are rivers.

488
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,084
- They're rivers?
- Yeah.

489
00:23:18,085 --> 00:23:19,197
We could get a boat.

490
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:25,064
Boats are dangerous.

491
00:23:39,506 --> 00:23:41,106
This is it.

492
00:23:41,107 --> 00:23:44,077
6765 Elmwood.

493
00:23:52,118 --> 00:23:53,285
You look nervous.

494
00:23:53,286 --> 00:23:55,054
I am nervous! I'm about to meet my kid

495
00:23:55,055 --> 00:23:56,122
and I don't know what to say to her.

496
00:23:56,123 --> 00:23:57,589
That's real easy, Har.

497
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:00,125
You make a little small talk about
why you missed all those birthdays,

498
00:24:00,126 --> 00:24:01,693
holidays and graduations.

499
00:24:01,694 --> 00:24:04,130
Maybe a couple of dick
jokes to put her at ease.

500
00:24:04,131 --> 00:24:05,264
And boing, you hit her up for the kidney.

501
00:24:05,265 --> 00:24:07,266
Okay. What if she says no?

502
00:24:07,267 --> 00:24:08,334
She's not gonna say no.

503
00:24:08,335 --> 00:24:10,037
She's the fruit of your loom.

504
00:24:15,474 --> 00:24:18,743
Suck me sideways.

505
00:24:18,744 --> 00:24:20,744
You're the spitting image of your mother.

506
00:24:20,745 --> 00:24:21,750
You morons.

507
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,652
This is the return address.

508
00:24:26,653 --> 00:24:29,758
Hers is on the side with the stamp.

509
00:24:31,758 --> 00:24:33,726
Oh.

510
00:24:33,727 --> 00:24:35,005
But it's still uncanny!

511
00:24:58,184 --> 00:25:00,152
Oxford, Maryland, huh?

512
00:25:00,153 --> 00:25:03,290
So that's where my little girl's
been living all these years.

513
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:04,789
Hey, Har!

514
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,858
Look it. Giant nutcracker.

515
00:25:06,859 --> 00:25:07,859
Oh.

516
00:25:09,663 --> 00:25:12,331
I want

517
00:25:12,332 --> 00:25:14,600
your nuts,

518
00:25:14,601 --> 00:25:17,136
Harry!

519
00:25:19,864 --> 00:25:23,642
Boy, I sure wish I could have been
there for her when she was little.

520
00:25:23,643 --> 00:25:24,809
Whatever.

521
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:27,345
That's all water under the fridge now, Har.

522
00:25:27,346 --> 00:25:28,646
Think of the bright side.

523
00:25:28,647 --> 00:25:29,748
You're finally getting to meet her

524
00:25:29,749 --> 00:25:32,418
and you never had to change
all those poopie diapers.

525
00:25:32,419 --> 00:25:34,653
That's called being a parent, Lloyd.

526
00:25:34,654 --> 00:25:37,666
Besides,
I changed your poopie diapers for 20 years.

527
00:25:49,301 --> 00:25:51,903
I totally sucked you in.

528
00:25:51,904 --> 00:25:54,473
Half the time, it wasn't even my poop.

529
00:26:01,448 --> 00:26:04,586
I wonder what it would have
been like to raise a child.

530
00:26:07,586 --> 00:26:11,031
Maybe I couldn't afford to send
her to the best public schools,

531
00:26:11,758 --> 00:26:14,425
but I'll bet I would have
been a pretty good dad.

532
00:26:21,601 --> 00:26:24,435
You don't need training wheels.
You can do this.

533
00:26:24,436 --> 00:26:25,738
Here we go!

534
00:26:25,739 --> 00:26:27,242
Come on, come on!

535
00:26:30,242 --> 00:26:32,310
No way!

536
00:26:32,311 --> 00:26:34,212
That was awesome!

537
00:26:34,213 --> 00:26:35,449
Awesome!

538
00:26:36,449 --> 00:26:37,617
Perfect. Okay.

539
00:26:38,617 --> 00:26:39,817
One,

540
00:26:39,818 --> 00:26:40,818
two,

541
00:26:41,721 --> 00:26:43,656
three.

542
00:26:51,286 --> 00:26:52,319
Hey, Mr. Dunne.

543
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,755
Hello, Baxter. How are you?
Good to see you.

544
00:26:54,756 --> 00:26:55,957
Here you go, honey.

545
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:57,847
- Thank you, Mr. Dunne!
- Bye, Dad!

546
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:00,315
- Isn't that good?
- Mmm-hmm.

547
00:27:01,596 --> 00:27:02,834
Mr. Dunne!

548
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:07,969
Mr. Dunne!

549
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:09,807
Hey, Mr. Dunne!

550
00:27:11,807 --> 00:27:13,374
Do you mind?

551
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:14,911
Bon appétit, kid!

552
00:27:30,325 --> 00:27:31,327
Lloyd!

553
00:27:32,327 --> 00:27:33,760
What are you doing?

554
00:27:33,761 --> 00:27:35,762
I was trying to clean off this smudge!

555
00:27:35,763 --> 00:27:37,498
But you know what?

556
00:27:37,499 --> 00:27:39,901
I think it might be on the inside!

557
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:45,973
<i>This type of evening always provides
nonstop surprises.</i>

558
00:27:45,974 --> 00:27:48,308
<i>Ah, look who's arrived. Tom Brady</i>

559
00:27:48,309 --> 00:27:51,312
<i>with his gorgeous wife,
Gisele, by his side.</i>

560
00:27:51,313 --> 00:27:54,258
<i>Doesn't she look radiant?
Tom's in agreement, I think.</i>

561
00:27:55,683 --> 00:27:58,352
Now that is hot.

562
00:27:58,353 --> 00:27:59,819
Yep.

563
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,362
That's why he gets all the girls.

564
00:28:16,939 --> 00:28:18,541
It sure would be nice.

565
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:20,943
What would be nice, Lloyd?

566
00:28:21,143 --> 00:28:23,143
Oh! You know,

567
00:28:23,144 --> 00:28:24,813
if she introduced me to
one of her hot girlfriends.

568
00:28:25,013 --> 00:28:26,847
Girlfriends.

569
00:28:26,848 --> 00:28:28,348
She's 22!

570
00:28:28,349 --> 00:28:30,050
So?

571
00:28:30,051 --> 00:28:33,054
So, that's a lot younger than you.

572
00:28:33,055 --> 00:28:34,088
Don't worry, when we get home,

573
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:36,089
I'm gonna fix you up with
someone your own age.

574
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,327
My age? Gross!

575
00:28:39,327 --> 00:28:41,563
I mean, what would we talk about?

576
00:28:41,564 --> 00:28:43,931
I don't know.
Same stuff you talked about in high school

577
00:28:43,932 --> 00:28:46,934
when you took chicks down
to Oyster Swallow Cove.

578
00:28:46,935 --> 00:28:49,269
Oyster Swallow Cove.

579
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,207
There's a trip down Mammary Lane.

580
00:28:56,578 --> 00:28:58,046
Oh, crap!

581
00:28:58,047 --> 00:28:59,514
We gotta get back to Providence!

582
00:28:59,515 --> 00:29:00,949
What? Why?

583
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:03,585
Remember I told you Ice Pick had to make
that rock candy run down to Maine?

584
00:29:03,586 --> 00:29:04,685
Yeah.

585
00:29:04,686 --> 00:29:07,686
I forgot to get someone to feed Butthole.

586
00:29:07,687 --> 00:29:09,624
Relax. I took care of it.

587
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:11,058
You did?

588
00:29:11,059 --> 00:29:13,894
Yeah. Billy in 4-C's gonna feed him.

589
00:29:13,895 --> 00:29:16,130
Oh, great!

590
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:17,598
Did you give him the key to our apartment?

591
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:18,600
No.

592
00:29:18,601 --> 00:29:20,634
You think I want wheel
marks all over the rug?

593
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:22,437
I just wrote him a note, left some food

594
00:29:22,438 --> 00:29:25,550
and threw Butthole inside his
place when we were leaving.

595
00:29:26,008 --> 00:29:29,120
But, Lloyd, Billy has
over a hundred rare birds in there!

596
00:29:30,112 --> 00:29:31,445
So?

597
00:29:31,446 --> 00:29:34,047
They're not gonna mess
with a 30-pound alley cat.

598
00:29:34,048 --> 00:29:35,452
Sheesh!

599
00:29:36,452 --> 00:29:38,088
Hey, gang! I'm home!

600
00:29:40,088 --> 00:29:41,323
Guys?

601
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:44,626
You sure are quiet.

602
00:29:47,296 --> 00:29:49,329
Speak to me, Siskel.

603
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,971
The horror! The horror!

604
00:29:59,042 --> 00:30:01,209
Are you sure you don't wanna come, Dad?

605
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:03,478
It's not gonna be nearly
as much fun without you.

606
00:30:03,479 --> 00:30:05,279
Oh, of course I wanna come, monkey,

607
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,892
but it's out of the question.

608
00:30:08,172 --> 00:30:09,784
I'm way too flu-ey to travel.

609
00:30:09,785 --> 00:30:12,921
But all the geeky science guys
are gonna be so disappointed.

610
00:30:12,922 --> 00:30:14,882
They were finally gonna
get to meet you in person!

611
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:16,324
So sorry, honey.

612
00:30:16,325 --> 00:30:18,593
Ms. Pinchelow, your car is here.

613
00:30:18,594 --> 00:30:19,628
Thanks, Travis!

614
00:30:20,628 --> 00:30:22,063
Okay!

615
00:30:22,064 --> 00:30:23,564
Take care of my dad, Adele.

616
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:25,333
Oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa!

617
00:30:25,334 --> 00:30:27,434
Penny,
do you have the speech I wrote for you?

618
00:30:27,435 --> 00:30:29,574
- I do.
- Good. Oh!

619
00:30:29,774 --> 00:30:31,941
I almost forgot. There's one more thing.

620
00:30:32,141 --> 00:30:34,009
I want you to take this box

621
00:30:34,567 --> 00:30:38,179
and personally give it to the head
of the conference, Dr. Walcott,

622
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,981
and say how sorry I am
that I can't be there.

623
00:30:40,982 --> 00:30:42,316
Got it.

624
00:30:42,317 --> 00:30:44,152
- Oh, what's in the box, honey?
- Mmm.

625
00:30:44,153 --> 00:30:46,320
Just a small gift.

626
00:30:46,321 --> 00:30:48,355
Wow, Penny. You're giving a speech?

627
00:30:48,356 --> 00:30:51,159
Oh, it's only a couple of
sentences on the last day,

628
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,161
but then I'm picking up
a reward for my dad.

629
00:30:53,162 --> 00:30:54,162
Award, honey.

630
00:30:54,542 --> 00:30:57,265
Did you remember to bring
the ATM card I gave you?

631
00:30:57,266 --> 00:31:00,701
Yes. But what's my PIN number again?
I keep forgetting.

632
00:31:00,702 --> 00:31:02,707
It's 11-11.

633
00:31:04,707 --> 00:31:06,707
I thought it had to be four numbers.

634
00:31:08,042 --> 00:31:09,477
There are four numbers.

635
00:31:09,478 --> 00:31:12,280
One-one-one-one.

636
00:31:13,382 --> 00:31:15,292
Time to go! Come on, Penny.

637
00:31:28,196 --> 00:31:29,633
Aw!

638
00:31:31,633 --> 00:31:35,370
Are you smiling at me?
Are you smiling at me?

639
00:31:35,371 --> 00:31:37,404
He's a good boy! Yes, he is!

640
00:31:37,405 --> 00:31:39,239
Let me see your purty teeth!

641
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,742
Oh! Say it, don't spray it!

642
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:55,390
We're almost there. The guy told
me to get off at the next exit.

643
00:31:55,391 --> 00:31:57,159
Shh. They're picking the lottery balls.

644
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:00,795
<i>Here's today's Mega-Lottery picks,
worth 34 million dollars.</i>

645
00:32:00,796 --> 00:32:04,132
<i>The first number is 44. The next is 2.</i>

646
00:32:04,133 --> 00:32:08,403
<i>38, 24, 21 and 54.</i>

647
00:32:08,404 --> 00:32:12,272
Cripes! I was so close!

648
00:32:12,273 --> 00:32:15,107
I had all the right numbers,
but in the wrong order.

649
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:20,781
<i>Honey, my stomach is killing me.</i>

650
00:32:20,782 --> 00:32:22,650
<i>Can you bring me some more Pepto?</i>

651
00:32:22,651 --> 00:32:24,751
I'm making you some nice warm oatmeal.

652
00:32:24,752 --> 00:32:26,197
It will settle your tummy.

653
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:40,723
What are you doing?

654
00:32:43,672 --> 00:32:45,450
I'm fixing lunch for my husband.

655
00:32:56,184 --> 00:32:57,287
That's not enough.

656
00:32:59,634 --> 00:33:02,690
We gotta pick up the pace a little bit.
We want him dead

657
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:05,358
before Dumbelina gets back from
that egghead convention, remember?

658
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:07,327
Slow it down.

659
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:10,097
If we put too much in at once,
it could show up in an autopsy.

660
00:33:10,098 --> 00:33:11,833
Not this stuff.

661
00:33:11,834 --> 00:33:14,201
I got it from my twin brother.
He's Special Ops.

662
00:33:14,202 --> 00:33:15,672
It's totally undetectable.

663
00:33:16,672 --> 00:33:19,473
Now come on. Let's hurry this up.

664
00:33:19,474 --> 00:33:21,275
That way we have a few
extra days to ourselves,

665
00:33:21,276 --> 00:33:23,343
to enjoy our inheritance.

666
00:33:23,344 --> 00:33:26,180
Oh,
there's gonna be plenty of time for that.

667
00:33:26,181 --> 00:33:29,119
Five million dollars
buys a lot of champagne.

668
00:33:34,523 --> 00:33:35,523
Give it to me.

669
00:33:43,197 --> 00:33:44,631
You like that, don't you?

670
00:33:44,632 --> 00:33:46,534
Yeah. It's all right.

671
00:33:48,269 --> 00:33:50,658
I'll be honest. It's not my favorite thing.

672
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,507
Who the hell is that?

673
00:33:56,478 --> 00:33:58,613
Boy, this is quite a shack, huh, Har?

674
00:33:58,614 --> 00:34:01,281
Yeah, but I bet if you pulled
the weeds off the walls

675
00:34:01,282 --> 00:34:03,817
and slapped up some aluminum siding,
it wouldn't be half bad.

676
00:34:03,818 --> 00:34:06,888
Yeah. Those things are rat ladders.

677
00:34:06,889 --> 00:34:08,390
<i>Please stop that.</i>

678
00:34:08,391 --> 00:34:11,259
<i>There's a very sick man in
here who's trying to rest.</i>

679
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:14,597
I'm sorry, lady!
We're looking for Fanny Felcher!

680
00:34:15,508 --> 00:34:16,897
The one with the kidneys.

681
00:34:16,898 --> 00:34:18,431
Is she there?

682
00:34:18,432 --> 00:34:20,868
There is no one here by that horrible name.

683
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:22,270
Now go away.

684
00:34:22,271 --> 00:34:24,839
Is this 6765 Elmwood Avenue,

685
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,576
Cranston, Rhode Island?

686
00:34:27,576 --> 00:34:29,310
<i>You're in Maryland.</i>

687
00:34:29,311 --> 00:34:30,745
The side with the stamp!

688
00:34:30,746 --> 00:34:33,781
I mean, uh, is this 1111 Foothill Road?

689
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:35,216
<i>That's right.</i>

690
00:34:35,217 --> 00:34:36,484
But there are no Felchers here.

691
00:34:36,485 --> 00:34:38,319
This is the Pinchelow residence.

692
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,587
Wait a second. My friend Harry here

693
00:34:40,588 --> 00:34:43,223
gave his daughter up for
adoption 20-something years ago

694
00:34:43,224 --> 00:34:45,292
and we were told this is where she lives.

695
00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:46,627
It's kind of a medical

696
00:34:46,628 --> 00:34:47,895
<i>emergency that we find her.</i>

697
00:34:47,896 --> 00:34:49,964
<i>As long as she doesn't have AIDS.</i>

698
00:34:49,965 --> 00:34:51,531
<i>Adele, darling, whoever they are,</i>

699
00:34:51,532 --> 00:34:52,866
<i>they must be talking about Penny!</i>

700
00:34:52,867 --> 00:34:54,669
<i>She was adopted.</i>

701
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,670
<i>I'll see them. Let them in.</i>

702
00:34:58,739 --> 00:35:01,209
What the hell was that?

703
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:02,910
That's exactly the kind of
random crap we don't need!

704
00:35:02,911 --> 00:35:03,911
Relax.

705
00:35:08,518 --> 00:35:10,685
Would you like some hot tea with lemon?

706
00:35:10,686 --> 00:35:13,453
Oh, no. I can see why you might think that.

707
00:35:13,454 --> 00:35:15,288
Two gentlemen traveling together.

708
00:35:15,289 --> 00:35:16,345
But we're straight.

709
00:35:18,327 --> 00:35:19,605
I must tell you, Harry,

710
00:35:20,596 --> 00:35:22,796
this is an unexpected treat.

711
00:35:22,797 --> 00:35:24,665
Yeah! Me, too.

712
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:28,835
You know, I always wondered what
Penny's natural father was like.

713
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:30,104
When my late wife and I adopted her,

714
00:35:30,105 --> 00:35:32,839
we weren't given much information
about her birth parents.

715
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,340
We were only told that her mother
was single and that she was...

716
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,846
You can say it, dear.

717
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:42,415
She was rumored to be a titanic whore.

718
00:35:42,416 --> 00:35:45,886
That's a lie!
Fraida never stepped foot on the <i>Titanic!</i>

719
00:35:45,887 --> 00:35:47,788
They must be talking about the
time she did the night crew

720
00:35:47,789 --> 00:35:49,523
on the Block Island Ferry.

721
00:35:50,626 --> 00:35:51,760
That's good!

722
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,030
So, is Penny here?

723
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,497
Unfortunately, no.

724
00:35:56,498 --> 00:35:57,964
She flew out this morning to El Paso.

725
00:35:57,965 --> 00:35:59,767
She's going to the KEN Conference.

726
00:35:59,768 --> 00:36:01,968
What? Who's this Ken guy?

727
00:36:01,969 --> 00:36:04,038
No. No.

728
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:06,573
The KEN Conference is a symposium

729
00:36:06,574 --> 00:36:09,377
where the year's newest technologies,
creative concepts and ideas

730
00:36:09,378 --> 00:36:10,977
are introduced and discussed.

731
00:36:10,978 --> 00:36:12,779
Wow.

732
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,716
That's the single most
boring sentence I ever heard.

733
00:36:15,717 --> 00:36:18,419
Adele,
what do you say we call Penny right now

734
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,721
with the news that her biological
father is looking for her?

735
00:36:20,722 --> 00:36:23,000
She'll be so excited.

736
00:36:23,001 --> 00:36:26,036
She might not be as excited as you think,
Doc.

737
00:36:26,037 --> 00:36:28,306
When her mother tried to
get in touch with her,

738
00:36:28,307 --> 00:36:30,085
she sent this letter right back.

739
00:36:30,867 --> 00:36:32,467
Mmm.

740
00:36:32,468 --> 00:36:34,103
That's interesting.

741
00:36:34,404 --> 00:36:35,404
What's that, dear?

742
00:36:36,172 --> 00:36:37,872
Uh, nothing.

743
00:36:37,873 --> 00:36:39,707
She just, uh, never mentioned it.

744
00:36:39,907 --> 00:36:41,809
But that was a couple of years ago.

745
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:44,479
I'm sure she'll appreciate
all the trouble you've gone to

746
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,415
to find her. Let's call her.

747
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:54,220
It's ringing!

748
00:36:59,861 --> 00:37:00,929
Whoever this is,

749
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:02,464
we're in the middle of
something really important.

750
00:37:02,465 --> 00:37:03,864
Can you call back later?

751
00:37:03,865 --> 00:37:05,232
No, I can't call back later.

752
00:37:05,233 --> 00:37:08,900
I have something to tell you that
might freak you out a little bit,

753
00:37:08,971 --> 00:37:10,838
but this is your dad.

754
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:13,175
What? Hold on.

755
00:37:13,176 --> 00:37:15,977
Hey, guys, I know this is weird timing,
but I gotta take this.

756
00:37:15,978 --> 00:37:17,211
It's my dead dad.

757
00:37:17,212 --> 00:37:18,379
She's got me on hold.

758
00:37:19,461 --> 00:37:22,017
Dad,
what did you do with all those <i>Penthouses?</i>

759
00:37:22,018 --> 00:37:23,184
Did you throw them out?

760
00:37:23,185 --> 00:37:24,986
No, they're under my mattress. Why?

761
00:37:24,987 --> 00:37:27,055
You idiot, that is Penny's phone!

762
00:37:27,056 --> 00:37:28,155
Oh.

763
00:37:28,156 --> 00:37:29,990
Oh, no. No.

764
00:37:29,991 --> 00:37:32,227
No! This is awful!

765
00:37:32,228 --> 00:37:33,894
She forgot the package!

766
00:37:33,895 --> 00:37:36,064
What are you doing? You shouldn't be up!

767
00:37:36,065 --> 00:37:37,865
Just relax. We can overnight it to her.

768
00:37:37,866 --> 00:37:39,901
No! No. We can't.

769
00:37:39,902 --> 00:37:42,604
The culmination of my
life's work is in this box.

770
00:37:42,605 --> 00:37:44,839
It's much too valuable to ship.

771
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,640
I thought you said it was just a gift.

772
00:37:46,641 --> 00:37:48,542
Oh, it is.

773
00:37:48,543 --> 00:37:51,745
A gift to all humanity.

774
00:37:51,746 --> 00:37:53,615
I wanted it to be a surprise, Adele.

775
00:37:53,616 --> 00:37:55,749
That's why I was unveiling
it at the KEN Conference.

776
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:56,518
Wow.

777
00:37:56,718 --> 00:37:59,187
Something like that's gotta
be worth millions, huh?

778
00:37:59,188 --> 00:38:01,890
- Try billions.
- Billions?

779
00:38:01,891 --> 00:38:04,725
Oh, yes. But I won't get a dime.

780
00:38:04,726 --> 00:38:07,095
It would be morally wrong
to profit from this.

781
00:38:07,096 --> 00:38:08,796
Huh?

782
00:38:08,797 --> 00:38:11,265
This box contains one of the most important

783
00:38:11,266 --> 00:38:13,200
discoveries in human history

784
00:38:13,201 --> 00:38:16,238
and all mankind deserves free access to it

785
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:19,073
and that is why I have relinquished

786
00:38:19,074 --> 00:38:20,743
all proprietary rights.

787
00:38:21,743 --> 00:38:23,245
Wait, when did you do that?

788
00:38:23,246 --> 00:38:24,979
It's all in the speech

789
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:28,149
that Penny's going to read
at the award ceremony.

790
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,755
Oh, my God, that's so nice!

791
00:38:32,755 --> 00:38:35,289
What in God's name?

792
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:37,902
You guys sounded busy,
so we built a couch-fort.

793
00:38:38,627 --> 00:38:40,227
You wanna come in, Dr. P?

794
00:38:40,228 --> 00:38:41,562
Sorry, no girls allowed.

795
00:38:42,297 --> 00:38:44,000
Boys rule, girls drool.

796
00:38:46,302 --> 00:38:47,968
Wait a minute.

797
00:38:47,969 --> 00:38:50,071
I have an idea.

798
00:38:50,072 --> 00:38:52,039
Why don't we have Harry and Lloyd

799
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,592
hand-deliver the box to Penny?

800
00:38:54,593 --> 00:38:57,178
That way Harry will get to
meet his daughter in person

801
00:38:57,179 --> 00:38:59,949
and you'll be assured the
box gets there safely.

802
00:39:02,284 --> 00:39:03,785
Are you insane?

803
00:39:03,786 --> 00:39:07,588
You think I'm just going to hand over
my invention to these 10-year-olds?

804
00:39:07,589 --> 00:39:09,224
Oh, don't you worry.
We'll have Travis go with them.

805
00:39:09,225 --> 00:39:10,992
He won't let anything happen to the box.

806
00:39:10,993 --> 00:39:13,327
And he will lead them straight to Penny.

807
00:39:13,328 --> 00:39:14,995
You can count on us, sir.

808
00:39:14,996 --> 00:39:17,067
Our word is our bond.

809
00:39:18,067 --> 00:39:19,971
James Bond.

810
00:39:24,854 --> 00:39:27,910
I'm going with them?
Why the hell did you tell him that?

811
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:30,245
Do you not realize what
just fell into our laps?

812
00:39:30,246 --> 00:39:33,647
Our five million just
turned into a billion.

813
00:39:33,648 --> 00:39:34,950
What's wrong with this thing?

814
00:39:34,951 --> 00:39:36,952
Yeah,
but he said he was gonna give it all away.

815
00:39:36,953 --> 00:39:39,802
Not if we get to Penny
before she reads that speech.

816
00:39:52,802 --> 00:39:54,336
Hey,

817
00:39:54,337 --> 00:39:56,338
when is this KEN thing, anyway?

818
00:39:56,339 --> 00:39:58,039
It actually starts today,

819
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,008
but Penny doesn't give her speech
until the night of May 2nd.

820
00:40:00,009 --> 00:40:01,943
So that gives us...

821
00:40:01,944 --> 00:40:03,378
How many days are in April?

822
00:40:03,379 --> 00:40:05,146
"Thirty days have September,

823
00:40:05,147 --> 00:40:07,182
"all the rest I can't remember."

824
00:40:07,183 --> 00:40:09,883
Must be 31 because nothing
rhymes with August.

825
00:40:09,884 --> 00:40:11,653
No, I think it's 32, Har.

826
00:40:11,654 --> 00:40:12,854
April's a leap month.

827
00:40:12,855 --> 00:40:14,856
- 31.
- 32.

828
00:40:14,857 --> 00:40:16,024
- 31.
- 32.

829
00:40:16,025 --> 00:40:18,258
- 31. 31, 1, 1, 1!
- 2, 2, 2!

830
00:40:18,259 --> 00:40:19,794
30! There's 30!

831
00:40:19,795 --> 00:40:20,797
Thank you!

832
00:40:21,797 --> 00:40:22,997
You said 31.

833
00:40:22,998 --> 00:40:25,066
Yeah, but I was closer.

834
00:40:25,067 --> 00:40:26,901
Hey, guys, where's the box?

835
00:40:26,902 --> 00:40:28,105
What box?

836
00:40:29,105 --> 00:40:31,717
The box with the
billion-dollar invention in it.

837
00:40:32,408 --> 00:40:34,408
Lloyd, what did you do with the box?

838
00:40:34,409 --> 00:40:36,343
Me? You had it.

839
00:40:36,344 --> 00:40:38,680
No, remember we stopped at that truck stop

840
00:40:38,681 --> 00:40:40,080
and we were kicking field goals with it

841
00:40:40,081 --> 00:40:42,017
- out in that parking lot?
- Yeah.

842
00:40:42,018 --> 00:40:44,051
I remember I kicked one over the
telephone wires, and you said...

843
00:40:44,052 --> 00:40:47,092
You know what, you're right. I did have it.

844
00:40:51,092 --> 00:40:53,028
Look at that!

845
00:40:53,029 --> 00:40:55,796
I just saved humanity!

846
00:40:55,797 --> 00:40:57,932
You know what?
Maybe I should hold on to that box.

847
00:40:57,933 --> 00:40:59,867
I don't think so, mister.

848
00:40:59,868 --> 00:41:01,803
Dr. P encrusted that to me.

849
00:41:01,804 --> 00:41:04,439
And I'm gonna make sure it gets
to my daughter, safe and sound.

850
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,709
Yeah, well, you're doing
a great job so far.

851
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,276
You guys wanna play "He Who Smelt It"?

852
00:41:09,277 --> 00:41:10,678
Yeah.

853
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:12,080
What's that?

854
00:41:12,081 --> 00:41:14,314
It's complicated, so pay attention.

855
00:41:14,315 --> 00:41:17,852
We put the windows up,
first one who smells a fart gets a point.

856
00:41:17,853 --> 00:41:19,387
If you say who dealt it,

857
00:41:19,388 --> 00:41:21,055
double points.

858
00:41:21,056 --> 00:41:22,289
But if you say you smelled a fart

859
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:23,325
and nobody farted,

860
00:41:23,326 --> 00:41:24,392
like if we were just
passing a slaughterhouse...

861
00:41:24,393 --> 00:41:25,693
False fart!

862
00:41:25,694 --> 00:41:29,064
...you lose a point.
And you can't smell your own farts, either.

863
00:41:29,264 --> 00:41:31,932
Are you guys kidding? No! No!

864
00:41:31,933 --> 00:41:34,803
I'm not gonna sit around sniffing your
farts like some kinda truffle pig.

865
00:41:34,804 --> 00:41:35,771
Forget it!

866
00:41:35,772 --> 00:41:37,705
Okay, fine.
Lloyd and I will play one-on-one.

867
00:41:37,706 --> 00:41:39,039
Yeah, head-to-head.

868
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,008
How can you play one-on-one?

869
00:41:41,009 --> 00:41:42,209
If you smell a fart, and you didn't do it,

870
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:44,155
isn't it obvious the other guy did?

871
00:41:46,027 --> 00:41:48,416
I thought you said you never played before.

872
00:41:48,417 --> 00:41:51,185
Yeah. Sounds like he wrote the rulebook.

873
00:41:51,186 --> 00:41:52,387
I think we might have a hustler here, Har.

874
00:41:52,388 --> 00:41:53,388
Uh-huh.

875
00:42:01,263 --> 00:42:02,998
What are you doing?

876
00:42:03,998 --> 00:42:05,399
I forgot.

877
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,167
Uh, you know what? I'm
going to make a rule.

878
00:42:07,168 --> 00:42:09,403
There will be no fart games
while I'm in the car, got it?

879
00:42:09,404 --> 00:42:10,771
Wow.

880
00:42:10,772 --> 00:42:12,384
Who made you king of the car?

881
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:14,508
I know how to settle this.

882
00:42:14,509 --> 00:42:16,778
I'm thinking of a number
between one and three.

883
00:42:16,779 --> 00:42:18,345
Whoever guesses it gets
to be king of the car.

884
00:42:18,346 --> 00:42:19,780
- One!
- No.

885
00:42:19,781 --> 00:42:20,784
- Three?
- Nope.

886
00:42:22,784 --> 00:42:23,784
Okay, what is it?

887
00:42:25,254 --> 00:42:26,321
Two.

888
00:42:26,322 --> 00:42:29,791
I swear I was gonna say that!

889
00:42:29,792 --> 00:42:32,794
All right, so it's agreed,
I'm king of the car, right?

890
00:42:32,795 --> 00:42:33,995
Fine.

891
00:42:33,996 --> 00:42:35,363
Excuse me, Your Highness,

892
00:42:35,364 --> 00:42:37,809
would you grab me a Slim
Jim out of the back?

893
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,267
One of the long ones.

894
00:42:40,101 --> 00:42:41,172
Yeah.

895
00:42:44,839 --> 00:42:46,117
Oh, hey, what the hell?

896
00:42:48,143 --> 00:42:49,410
Oh, God! Hey!

897
00:42:49,411 --> 00:42:51,413
No! Hey!

898
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:56,851
What is that? Oh, God!

899
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,155
Look, Harry.

900
00:43:00,156 --> 00:43:01,790
He's hooked on crack.

901
00:43:03,926 --> 00:43:07,095
For the love of God, have mercy!

902
00:43:07,096 --> 00:43:09,330
<i>Hello, you've reached Herbert Felcher</i>

903
00:43:09,331 --> 00:43:11,800
<i>at Felcher and Felcher Funeral Parlor.</i>

904
00:43:11,801 --> 00:43:13,585
<i>Please leave a message at the beep.</i>

905
00:43:13,586 --> 00:43:16,403
Hi! This is a private message
for Fraida Felcher.

906
00:43:16,404 --> 00:43:18,807
Would you please tell
Fraida that Harry called?

907
00:43:18,808 --> 00:43:20,542
Harry Dunne.

908
00:43:20,543 --> 00:43:23,443
The guy who knocked her
up 20-something years ago.

909
00:43:23,444 --> 00:43:27,347
Um, pleasure finally meeting you all,
by the way.

910
00:43:27,348 --> 00:43:30,985
Anyway, would you tell her
that I've located our daughter.

911
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:36,191
She's at a thing called the
KEN Conference in El Paso.

912
00:43:36,192 --> 00:43:38,081
The town named after the bean dip.

913
00:44:06,422 --> 00:44:07,422
Oh, that's sweet!

914
00:44:10,226 --> 00:44:11,392
Bye, Grandma!

915
00:44:11,393 --> 00:44:12,393
Have fun, sweetie.

916
00:44:16,297 --> 00:44:18,265
Now, there's a real man.

917
00:44:18,266 --> 00:44:20,971
I bet you he don't pee sitting down.

918
00:44:37,987 --> 00:44:39,987
Don't touch that joystick!

919
00:44:44,627 --> 00:44:45,964
Wow, look!

920
00:44:49,964 --> 00:44:51,432
Let my people

921
00:44:51,433 --> 00:44:52,433
go!

922
00:44:52,601 --> 00:44:53,601
Harry!

923
00:44:57,339 --> 00:45:00,173
It hurts, Lloyd. It hurts so bad.

924
00:45:00,174 --> 00:45:02,674
Which one hurts, Harry?
This one? Or this one?

925
00:45:02,978 --> 00:45:06,146
Stop it! Lloyd, please,

926
00:45:06,147 --> 00:45:07,448
save my daughter.

927
00:45:07,449 --> 00:45:09,050
And then

928
00:45:09,051 --> 00:45:11,496
I want you to bone her
like a chicken cutlet.

929
00:45:12,121 --> 00:45:13,422
You hear me, mister?

930
00:45:27,536 --> 00:45:28,670
Huh?

931
00:45:53,462 --> 00:45:55,230
Looking for these?

932
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:29,069
Oh!

933
00:46:30,069 --> 00:46:31,371
What are you doing?

934
00:46:32,371 --> 00:46:33,609
Oh. Uh...

935
00:46:36,609 --> 00:46:37,776
She's all clean, sir.

936
00:46:38,444 --> 00:46:39,444
You're good to go.

937
00:46:40,413 --> 00:46:41,413
Nutcase.

938
00:46:44,282 --> 00:46:46,052
Hey, guys.

939
00:46:51,357 --> 00:46:53,392
Let's call a truce, huh?

940
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:55,394
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

941
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:58,330
I don't wanna argue with you
guys all the way down to El Paso.

942
00:46:58,331 --> 00:46:59,776
So what do you say? Peace?

943
00:47:01,667 --> 00:47:03,270
Come on, bring it in!

944
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:06,074
Yeah, why not?

945
00:47:08,074 --> 00:47:09,173
Hmm.

946
00:47:09,174 --> 00:47:10,542
Okay.

947
00:47:10,543 --> 00:47:13,577
- Hey, all right. All right, that's good.
- Mmm...

948
00:47:13,578 --> 00:47:15,814
- All right, all right, all right.
- Aw.

949
00:47:15,815 --> 00:47:17,682
Hey!
Have you guys ever played "Funnel Nuts"?

950
00:47:17,683 --> 00:47:19,450
What?

951
00:47:19,451 --> 00:47:21,553
Oh, come on.
You guys have had to play Funnel Nuts.

952
00:47:21,554 --> 00:47:23,588
This is the best game ever invented.

953
00:47:23,589 --> 00:47:24,756
Check it out, you take the funnel,

954
00:47:24,757 --> 00:47:26,725
you put it in the front of
your pants like that, right?

955
00:47:26,726 --> 00:47:30,327
Okay? Then you put a peanut
on your nose like this,

956
00:47:30,328 --> 00:47:31,940
and then when you're ready...

957
00:47:32,364 --> 00:47:34,131
No way!

958
00:47:34,132 --> 00:47:35,399
You gotta be kidding!

959
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,400
That's not right!

960
00:47:37,569 --> 00:47:39,738
The person who gets the most nuts wins.

961
00:47:39,739 --> 00:47:41,405
Now, who's gonna play me first?

962
00:47:41,406 --> 00:47:43,508
I'll do it. I got it.

963
00:47:43,509 --> 00:47:45,142
- This is mine!
- You always go first!

964
00:47:45,143 --> 00:47:46,577
I got it first!

965
00:47:46,578 --> 00:47:48,747
Guys, hold on, all right? Look.

966
00:47:48,748 --> 00:47:51,885
You guys play each other first,
and then I'll play the winner.

967
00:47:52,085 --> 00:47:53,452
All right.

968
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:55,255
All right. Here you go.

969
00:47:55,988 --> 00:47:57,655
Take your time. It takes time.

970
00:47:57,656 --> 00:47:59,291
Get a good balance on that.

971
00:47:59,292 --> 00:48:01,325
- Okay.
- Look way up high.

972
00:48:01,326 --> 00:48:04,095
Good. Okay, keep looking at the sky.
When you're ready.

973
00:48:04,096 --> 00:48:05,729
Now don't drop it until you're ready, guys.

974
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:06,730
I got it!

975
00:48:09,067 --> 00:48:10,234
- That's weird.
- Ooh!

976
00:48:10,235 --> 00:48:13,013
- The smell of peanuts makes my weenie cold.
- Ooh!

977
00:48:14,107 --> 00:48:15,107
It shrank mine.

978
00:48:16,542 --> 00:48:17,776
Oh!

979
00:48:17,777 --> 00:48:19,145
Hey!

980
00:48:21,614 --> 00:48:24,351
Do you believe that?
Did you see what he did?

981
00:48:25,351 --> 00:48:26,351
It's on!

982
00:48:28,121 --> 00:48:29,153
Oh, yeah.

983
00:48:29,154 --> 00:48:31,323
He's going down!

984
00:48:31,324 --> 00:48:33,658
Right after we finish playing Funnel Nuts.

985
00:48:46,205 --> 00:48:48,094
- Shh. Don't wake him up!
- I know.

986
00:48:51,743 --> 00:48:53,410
How many did you put in there?

987
00:48:53,411 --> 00:48:55,480
Just enough to get a rise out of him.

988
00:49:12,397 --> 00:49:13,699
No! Oh, God!

989
00:49:14,699 --> 00:49:16,335
No! Oh, my God!

990
00:49:27,846 --> 00:49:28,846
Oh, my God!

991
00:49:30,583 --> 00:49:32,752
Wait, Lloyd. I think he might be hurt.

992
00:49:35,654 --> 00:49:38,823
Man, you okay? It was just a goof.

993
00:49:38,824 --> 00:49:42,727
Yeah. By the way, we're even.

994
00:49:42,728 --> 00:49:45,696
I want them dead, now! Now! Do you hear me?

995
00:49:45,697 --> 00:49:47,231
<i>Calm down.</i>

996
00:49:47,232 --> 00:49:49,767
No! No, I can't take it any longer!

997
00:49:49,768 --> 00:49:51,336
If you don't let me kill them now,

998
00:49:51,337 --> 00:49:52,671
I am quitting, and I mean it!

999
00:49:52,672 --> 00:49:55,439
Okay. Give me some time to think.

1000
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,941
<i>I'll come up with a plan.</i>

1001
00:49:56,942 --> 00:49:59,878
Plan? You don't need a plan!
These guys are morons!

1002
00:49:59,879 --> 00:50:02,513
Besides, I told you,
my brother's in Special Ops.

1003
00:50:02,514 --> 00:50:04,749
I know how to get stuff done!

1004
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:08,320
All right. But make sure nobody
knows they paid us a visit.

1005
00:50:08,321 --> 00:50:09,955
<i>I don't want this coming back to us.</i>

1006
00:50:09,956 --> 00:50:11,956
God, shut up!

1007
00:50:19,965 --> 00:50:21,768
I wonder what's in this sucker.

1008
00:50:22,768 --> 00:50:24,736
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1009
00:50:24,737 --> 00:50:26,537
That thing is worth a fortune! Be careful!

1010
00:50:26,538 --> 00:50:28,640
Give it to me.

1011
00:50:28,641 --> 00:50:30,874
It would be nice to know what's in it,
though.

1012
00:50:30,875 --> 00:50:33,278
I've been racking my sack about that.

1013
00:50:33,279 --> 00:50:34,646
I have a theory.

1014
00:50:34,647 --> 00:50:36,548
Oh, yeah?

1015
00:50:36,549 --> 00:50:38,617
He said it was something that would
help everybody in the world, right?

1016
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:39,818
Yeah.

1017
00:50:39,819 --> 00:50:43,622
I think it might be a baked potato.

1018
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:46,457
How does a baked potato
help everybody in the world?

1019
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:49,514
That's the only part I
haven't figured out yet.

1020
00:50:50,328 --> 00:50:51,830
You'll get it, Lloyd.

1021
00:50:51,831 --> 00:50:55,054
We should pick up some sour cream
and chives, just in case.

1022
00:50:55,502 --> 00:50:57,669
Do you guys have any idea where we are?

1023
00:50:57,670 --> 00:50:58,970
Not really.

1024
00:50:58,971 --> 00:51:01,539
You're the one who told us to
take the shortcut off the highway.

1025
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:04,441
Yeah. It's like you wanted to get us alone,
so you could kill us

1026
00:51:04,442 --> 00:51:06,343
and take the billion-dollar box.

1027
00:51:06,344 --> 00:51:07,956
But what would be the motive?

1028
00:51:08,413 --> 00:51:09,449
Yeah.

1029
00:51:10,449 --> 00:51:11,685
Yeah.

1030
00:51:12,185 --> 00:51:14,352
I better get a map out of the bag, huh?

1031
00:51:14,353 --> 00:51:15,790
- Sure.
- Okay.

1032
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:20,691
So, guys, who else is helping
you look for your daughter?

1033
00:51:20,692 --> 00:51:21,626
- No one.
- Mmm-hmm.

1034
00:51:21,627 --> 00:51:23,060
Nobody?

1035
00:51:23,061 --> 00:51:25,497
- Not even some friends to lend a hand?
- Mmm-mmm.

1036
00:51:25,498 --> 00:51:26,964
Nope, just us.

1037
00:51:26,965 --> 00:51:28,932
- What about your wives?
- Wives?

1038
00:51:28,933 --> 00:51:30,971
How stupid do we look?

1039
00:51:31,971 --> 00:51:33,370
Harry?

1040
00:51:33,371 --> 00:51:35,007
Easy.

1041
00:51:39,311 --> 00:51:41,345
- Close one.
- Any girlfriends?

1042
00:51:41,346 --> 00:51:43,314
Been there, done that.

1043
00:51:43,315 --> 00:51:46,017
See, we don't want to be tied
down by anything or anyone.

1044
00:51:46,018 --> 00:51:48,019
We don't even have social security cards.

1045
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:50,555
We sold them for 30 bucks
to two Brazilian guys.

1046
00:51:50,556 --> 00:51:52,334
And the good thing about having no identity

1047
00:51:52,534 --> 00:51:54,725
is that you never have to
worry about identity theft.

1048
00:51:54,726 --> 00:51:56,894
He can't even be identified by his teeth

1049
00:51:56,895 --> 00:51:59,064
because he's never even been to a dentist.

1050
00:51:59,065 --> 00:52:01,832
And I've never joined anything. Ever.

1051
00:52:01,833 --> 00:52:03,702
That's how you keep a low-pro.

1052
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:07,004
Yep,
there's no actual proof that we even exist.

1053
00:52:07,005 --> 00:52:09,673
If we died, no one would even miss us.

1054
00:52:09,674 --> 00:52:12,344
We are truly blessed.

1055
00:52:27,592 --> 00:52:29,894
What the hell happened, Harry?

1056
00:52:29,895 --> 00:52:31,528
What?

1057
00:52:31,529 --> 00:52:33,932
What the hell happened?

1058
00:52:33,933 --> 00:52:36,600
- Whoo!
- I can't hear you!

1059
00:52:36,601 --> 00:52:38,069
So long, boys.

1060
00:52:53,052 --> 00:52:56,588
We may have been involved in
an alien abduction, Harry.

1061
00:52:56,589 --> 00:52:58,089
Is your butt okay?

1062
00:53:00,525 --> 00:53:01,926
Harry!

1063
00:53:01,927 --> 00:53:03,160
Holy crap!

1064
00:53:03,161 --> 00:53:05,028
He took off on us!

1065
00:53:05,029 --> 00:53:06,731
What?

1066
00:53:06,732 --> 00:53:09,969
He took off on us.

1067
00:53:10,969 --> 00:53:13,571
What?

1068
00:53:13,572 --> 00:53:17,075
I can't believe that
douchebag stole our hearse.

1069
00:53:17,076 --> 00:53:19,410
I hope something really bad happens to him.

1070
00:53:19,411 --> 00:53:21,447
No, but I tried ostrich once.

1071
00:53:22,447 --> 00:53:24,983
Harry, holy cow.

1072
00:53:24,984 --> 00:53:26,484
I'm worried about you.

1073
00:53:26,485 --> 00:53:28,586
You're as deaf as a bat.

1074
00:53:28,587 --> 00:53:31,155
That's not exactly how it happened, Lloyd.

1075
00:53:31,156 --> 00:53:34,027
Your mother got into bed with me.

1076
00:53:36,027 --> 00:53:38,361
That's it. We're getting you hearing aids.

1077
00:53:42,435 --> 00:53:43,603
May I help you?

1078
00:53:44,603 --> 00:53:46,171
Um...

1079
00:53:46,172 --> 00:53:49,284
My friend here would like to
visit his sweet ol' grandma.

1080
00:53:49,741 --> 00:53:50,975
What's the name?

1081
00:53:50,976 --> 00:53:52,876
I'll give you a hint.

1082
00:53:52,877 --> 00:53:55,322
She's the one with the
biggest hearing aids.

1083
00:54:00,052 --> 00:54:02,830
Ms. Snergle,
your grandson and his friend are here.

1084
00:54:05,491 --> 00:54:06,890
This is stupid, Lloyd!

1085
00:54:06,891 --> 00:54:09,391
I'm not gonna steal an
old lady's hearing aid!

1086
00:54:09,962 --> 00:54:11,562
Relax!

1087
00:54:11,563 --> 00:54:16,033
We're just looking for a backup pair.

1088
00:54:16,034 --> 00:54:17,942
There's gotta be some around here.

1089
00:54:22,942 --> 00:54:23,942
Mikey?

1090
00:54:25,543 --> 00:54:26,810
Yeah, Gran.

1091
00:54:26,811 --> 00:54:28,213
It's Mikey.

1092
00:54:28,214 --> 00:54:30,682
Oh, thank God you're here.

1093
00:54:30,683 --> 00:54:31,906
I've got the diamonds.

1094
00:54:33,118 --> 00:54:34,619
Did she say diamonds?

1095
00:54:37,022 --> 00:54:39,724
Go ahead, Granny. Mikey's listening.

1096
00:54:39,725 --> 00:54:43,060
I want you to take all the
diamonds with you when you go.

1097
00:54:43,061 --> 00:54:45,997
I've been hiding them from
those thieving lawyers.

1098
00:54:45,998 --> 00:54:47,564
That's good.

1099
00:54:47,565 --> 00:54:49,167
Granny did a good thing!

1100
00:54:49,168 --> 00:54:51,702
So, where are the rocks?

1101
00:54:51,703 --> 00:54:53,238
They're underneath me.

1102
00:54:53,239 --> 00:54:54,671
You mean, under the bed?

1103
00:54:54,672 --> 00:54:56,777
- No, under the blanket.
- Oh.

1104
00:55:01,891 --> 00:55:03,280
I'm not finding anything.

1105
00:55:03,281 --> 00:55:05,819
Go up more.

1106
00:55:06,819 --> 00:55:08,989
- Up here?
- Keep going.

1107
00:55:09,867 --> 00:55:11,923
Did you hide them inside this turkey?

1108
00:55:11,924 --> 00:55:13,291
Yeah, right.

1109
00:55:13,292 --> 00:55:15,526
Wait.

1110
00:55:15,527 --> 00:55:16,861
There's no diamonds here!

1111
00:55:16,862 --> 00:55:19,897
And you're not my grandson!

1112
00:55:19,898 --> 00:55:21,999
Harry, she's got me.

1113
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Ahhh!

1114
00:55:24,951 --> 00:55:28,555
Hey, Goldfinger!

1115
00:55:28,556 --> 00:55:30,789
Here.

1116
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:32,634
You've earned them.

1117
00:55:41,634 --> 00:55:43,570
Are you serious?

1118
00:55:43,571 --> 00:55:45,604
Travis is dead?

1119
00:55:45,605 --> 00:55:46,906
<i>That's right.</i>

1120
00:55:46,907 --> 00:55:48,774
<i>The Kansas state police
informed me this morning.</i>

1121
00:55:48,775 --> 00:55:50,387
<i>I thought you'd want to know.</i>

1122
00:55:51,645 --> 00:55:54,314
Thank you, Captain Lippincott.

1123
00:55:54,315 --> 00:55:58,017
I know it's never easy to
relay this kind of sad news.

1124
00:55:58,018 --> 00:56:00,018
But I want you to know that your brother,
Travis,

1125
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:01,921
was more than just a handyman to us.

1126
00:56:01,922 --> 00:56:02,922
He was

1127
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:05,792
family.

1128
00:56:05,793 --> 00:56:07,093
<i>Really?</i>

1129
00:56:07,094 --> 00:56:10,764
<i>Do you suck the toe jam
off Mommy and Daddy, too?</i>

1130
00:56:11,764 --> 00:56:13,668
Um, I beg your pardon?

1131
00:56:14,668 --> 00:56:16,335
My brother told me everything.

1132
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:21,707
I don't know what you're talking about.

1133
00:56:21,708 --> 00:56:24,176
Look, lady,
I know you're terminating your husband.

1134
00:56:24,177 --> 00:56:26,345
I'm the one who supplied
you with the untraceables.

1135
00:56:26,346 --> 00:56:28,180
Remember? I also know

1136
00:56:28,181 --> 00:56:31,149
that my brother was supposed
to eliminate those two idiots,

1137
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:33,484
but somehow they turned the tables on him.

1138
00:56:34,254 --> 00:56:35,821
Relax.

1139
00:56:35,822 --> 00:56:37,378
I'm not here to turn you in.

1140
00:56:38,058 --> 00:56:39,447
I'm here to help you out.

1141
00:56:44,186 --> 00:56:45,964
So how are those things working?

1142
00:56:45,965 --> 00:56:47,934
Not bad. I can hear you a little.

1143
00:56:47,935 --> 00:56:49,380
Here, let me turn them up.

1144
00:56:52,973 --> 00:56:55,874
Honey, would you like some pancakes?

1145
00:56:55,875 --> 00:56:57,142
Yeah, I'd love some pancakes.

1146
00:56:57,143 --> 00:56:58,143
What?

1147
00:56:59,746 --> 00:57:01,948
- Stop yelling!
- I'm not yelling.

1148
00:57:01,949 --> 00:57:03,749
Why would you say I'm yelling?

1149
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:04,750
This is yelling!

1150
00:57:08,322 --> 00:57:09,891
Harry!

1151
00:57:11,891 --> 00:57:14,336
I think I might have
turned them up too high!

1152
00:57:15,328 --> 00:57:17,900
Oh, look! Barbara Hershey Highway.

1153
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:21,036
Wait a minute.

1154
00:57:22,036 --> 00:57:24,403
I think I know where we are.

1155
00:57:24,404 --> 00:57:25,404
Follow me.

1156
00:57:33,179 --> 00:57:35,280
Are you sure about this, Lloyd?

1157
00:57:35,281 --> 00:57:38,837
Positive. The kid worked at the
hockey rink just past the museum.

1158
00:57:40,688 --> 00:57:41,723
Come on, Harry!

1159
00:57:43,723 --> 00:57:45,697
He drove a Zamboni!

1160
00:57:54,234 --> 00:57:58,236
Oh, my God.
I never thought I'd see her again.

1161
00:57:58,237 --> 00:58:00,772
I don't know if I told you this, Har,

1162
00:58:00,773 --> 00:58:03,910
but that kid kinda porked me when
I traded him for the mini bike.

1163
00:58:03,911 --> 00:58:06,982
And he only gave me a quarter-tank of gas.

1164
00:58:08,982 --> 00:58:10,927
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

1165
00:58:36,409 --> 00:58:37,409
Yeah!

1166
00:58:54,828 --> 00:58:55,828
Bush club!

1167
00:58:56,196 --> 00:58:58,196
Bush club! Bush club! Bush club!

1168
00:59:12,179 --> 00:59:13,845
I feel really good, Har.

1169
00:59:13,846 --> 00:59:15,013
Me, too!

1170
00:59:15,014 --> 00:59:16,983
Really good!

1171
00:59:16,984 --> 00:59:18,873
You might want to step on it, Har!

1172
00:59:45,813 --> 00:59:47,546
Wow, look at all the brains.

1173
00:59:47,547 --> 00:59:49,881
They're blinding me with science!

1174
00:59:49,882 --> 00:59:52,184
Okay, Lloyd. I'm gonna find out
what time this thing starts.

1175
00:59:52,185 --> 00:59:53,318
You keep an eye out for Penny.

1176
00:59:53,319 --> 00:59:55,254
Roger that.

1177
00:59:55,255 --> 00:59:58,191
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is an AMBER Alert.

1178
00:59:58,192 --> 01:00:02,260
Has anybody seen this lovely,
delicate angel?

1179
01:00:02,261 --> 01:00:04,863
Have you seen her? Lovely and delicate.

1180
01:00:04,864 --> 01:00:06,967
This girl is slammin'.

1181
01:00:07,967 --> 01:00:09,568
Oh, yeah, sure, I know her.

1182
01:00:09,569 --> 01:00:10,937
I got a hit.

1183
01:00:10,938 --> 01:00:12,037
It's, uh, Penny Pinchelow.

1184
01:00:12,038 --> 01:00:13,138
I met her at the bar yesterday.

1185
01:00:13,139 --> 01:00:14,307
What's that supposed to mean?

1186
01:00:14,308 --> 01:00:15,308
Whoa! Easy, hoser!

1187
01:00:16,065 --> 01:00:17,510
We just hung out a little.

1188
01:00:17,511 --> 01:00:18,511
Oh.

1189
01:00:20,003 --> 01:00:22,448
Do you happen to know
where she is right now?

1190
01:00:22,449 --> 01:00:25,017
Yeah, my, uh, friends just went
to meet her at her hotel room.

1191
01:00:25,018 --> 01:00:26,084
They're walking her over here.

1192
01:00:26,085 --> 01:00:27,185
She's giving a speech tonight.

1193
01:00:27,186 --> 01:00:28,588
When you see her,

1194
01:00:28,589 --> 01:00:30,890
tell her that Lloyd and her
dad are looking for her.

1195
01:00:30,891 --> 01:00:32,614
And get her to call me on this.

1196
01:00:34,427 --> 01:00:35,427
There you are!

1197
01:00:37,052 --> 01:00:38,997
I've been looking all over for you.

1198
01:00:38,998 --> 01:00:40,499
Cool!

1199
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,133
I just ran into a Mexican
guy who knows Penny.

1200
01:00:42,134 --> 01:00:43,368
He said she's on her way!

1201
01:00:43,369 --> 01:00:44,970
Come on, let's get in line.

1202
01:00:44,971 --> 01:00:46,504
Dressed like this?

1203
01:00:46,505 --> 01:00:49,876
Harry,
people who come to these things are smart.

1204
01:00:49,877 --> 01:00:52,310
We can't go in there looking
like a couple of goofballs.

1205
01:00:52,311 --> 01:00:54,534
Oh, yeah. Let's go buy some smart stuff.

1206
01:01:13,132 --> 01:01:15,001
How's your day?

1207
01:01:15,002 --> 01:01:16,339
Living the dream.

1208
01:01:20,339 --> 01:01:23,980
Ooh, that mac and cheese looks good!

1209
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:31,350
Um, I think I'm gonna need some chopsticks

1210
01:01:31,351 --> 01:01:34,287
or a really, really skinny fork.

1211
01:01:34,288 --> 01:01:36,089
You got it.

1212
01:01:37,491 --> 01:01:39,024
It's open!

1213
01:01:39,025 --> 01:01:40,258
Hey, Penny!

1214
01:01:40,259 --> 01:01:42,461
Hey, Tom! Hey, Gus!

1215
01:01:42,462 --> 01:01:45,363
Hey, uh, Penny. Um...

1216
01:01:45,364 --> 01:01:46,599
What are you doing in your undies

1217
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,802
in front of the room service guy here, eh?

1218
01:01:49,002 --> 01:01:50,368
You don't know him.

1219
01:01:50,369 --> 01:01:53,338
Oh, no. Someone told me this great
trick about how not to get nervous

1220
01:01:53,339 --> 01:01:55,073
when you're giving a speech.

1221
01:01:55,074 --> 01:01:57,475
All you do is imagine that
you're in your underwear.

1222
01:01:57,476 --> 01:01:59,979
So I've been practicing all afternoon.

1223
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:01,280
Will there be anything else, ma'am?

1224
01:02:01,281 --> 01:02:03,649
Oh, no. Just that skinny fork.

1225
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:05,051
Right.

1226
01:02:05,052 --> 01:02:06,952
Okay. Burning daylight.

1227
01:02:06,953 --> 01:02:09,521
Yeah. Oh! Great news.
Your dad showed up for the conference.

1228
01:02:09,522 --> 01:02:12,191
- What?
- Yeah, Gordy just called us.

1229
01:02:12,192 --> 01:02:14,392
He ran into some guy named
Lloyd who was with your father.

1230
01:02:14,393 --> 01:02:17,671
They were looking for them out
front of the convention hall.

1231
01:02:22,268 --> 01:02:24,470
Oh, my goodness.

1232
01:02:24,471 --> 01:02:27,305
Are you absolutely certain?

1233
01:02:27,306 --> 01:02:30,008
And there's no way you're mistaken?

1234
01:02:30,009 --> 01:02:32,211
All right, um, yes, then I'll have someone

1235
01:02:32,212 --> 01:02:33,412
meet him at the door in a hurry.

1236
01:02:33,413 --> 01:02:35,314
Yes, okay. Goodbye.

1237
01:02:35,315 --> 01:02:36,649
What is it?

1238
01:02:36,650 --> 01:02:38,551
Dr. Pinchelow is coming.

1239
01:02:38,552 --> 01:02:41,220
What? Are you certain?
I thought he was sick!

1240
01:02:41,221 --> 01:02:42,287
Apparently he's better.

1241
01:02:42,288 --> 01:02:44,022
I just spoke with his daughter,
Penny, on the phone

1242
01:02:44,023 --> 01:02:45,524
and she's headed right
over here to meet him.

1243
01:02:45,525 --> 01:02:47,559
Oh, the man didn't even show
up for his Nobel ceremony.

1244
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:50,662
He showed up for us. Go find him.

1245
01:02:50,663 --> 01:02:52,108
Uh, yeah, yeah, I'm on it.

1246
01:02:58,739 --> 01:03:00,472
Lloyd, look!

1247
01:03:00,473 --> 01:03:01,751
Penny is speaking soon.

1248
01:03:03,110 --> 01:03:04,110
That's so hot.

1249
01:03:14,353 --> 01:03:17,589
- Is it done?
- No.

1250
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:20,924
Some Canadian douchebags barged
in before I could finish her.

1251
01:03:22,029 --> 01:03:23,696
Okay.

1252
01:03:23,697 --> 01:03:27,233
You follow Penny,
and the next chance you get, kill her.

1253
01:03:27,234 --> 01:03:29,334
I'll take out the guys, get the box.

1254
01:03:29,335 --> 01:03:30,903
What if they have already
gone into the KEN conference?

1255
01:03:31,103 --> 01:03:32,504
Not a chance.

1256
01:03:32,505 --> 01:03:35,608
The event's been sold out for over a year,
and the security is insane.

1257
01:03:35,609 --> 01:03:37,142
Tickets, please.

1258
01:03:37,143 --> 01:03:38,611
No, thank you.

1259
01:03:38,612 --> 01:03:40,780
We're not much for boring speeches.

1260
01:03:40,781 --> 01:03:43,582
We just have to make sure that
his daughter gets this box.

1261
01:03:43,583 --> 01:03:46,121
No tickie, no entry. No exceptions.

1262
01:03:48,855 --> 01:03:50,689
<i>Have you found Dr. Pinchelow yet?</i>

1263
01:03:50,690 --> 01:03:52,658
No. I don't even know what he looks like.

1264
01:03:52,659 --> 01:03:53,725
This is ridiculous.

1265
01:03:53,726 --> 01:03:55,760
How am I supposed to find
the man in this throng

1266
01:03:55,761 --> 01:03:58,497
when all I know about him is
that he wears hearing aids?

1267
01:03:58,498 --> 01:04:01,569
Great. It's sold out. I'm dead.

1268
01:04:02,569 --> 01:04:04,737
So much for higher education.

1269
01:04:07,406 --> 01:04:09,408
Relax, Har.

1270
01:04:09,409 --> 01:04:11,776
We're gonna find her.
Don't get that dying kidney all worked up.

1271
01:04:11,777 --> 01:04:13,446
Oh, it's not the kidney.

1272
01:04:13,447 --> 01:04:15,146
I think I gotta pinch a loaf.

1273
01:04:15,147 --> 01:04:18,149
Pinchelow? Did someone say Pinchelow?

1274
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:20,151
Oh, my goodness, it is you!

1275
01:04:20,152 --> 01:04:22,421
You're really here! I'm Dr. Meldmann.

1276
01:04:22,422 --> 01:04:24,189
How was your trip from Maryland?

1277
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:25,425
Not so great.

1278
01:04:25,426 --> 01:04:28,482
Somebody stole our car and
he finger-bombed an old lady.

1279
01:04:29,462 --> 01:04:31,229
Sounds terrible.

1280
01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:32,564
We'll take really good care
of you now that you're here.

1281
01:04:32,565 --> 01:04:33,798
Uh, would you like to go into the foyer

1282
01:04:33,799 --> 01:04:35,867
for the cocktail reception, Dr. Pinchelow?

1283
01:04:35,868 --> 01:04:37,635
- Oh.
- Yes, Dr. Pinchelow would love to go

1284
01:04:37,636 --> 01:04:39,537
to the foyer for the cocktail reception.

1285
01:04:39,538 --> 01:04:41,875
Yeah, cool. Let's get ripped.

1286
01:04:42,875 --> 01:04:44,645
Uh, this way, please.

1287
01:04:45,645 --> 01:04:47,513
I'm sorry, your name is?

1288
01:04:47,514 --> 01:04:49,381
I'm his associate, Dr. Christmas.

1289
01:04:49,382 --> 01:04:51,249
Ah, Christmas like the holiday?

1290
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:53,487
No. Like the tree.

1291
01:04:54,487 --> 01:04:56,321
May I ask you a question, Doctor,

1292
01:04:56,322 --> 01:04:57,689
and I don't mean to be insensitive,

1293
01:04:57,690 --> 01:05:00,725
but, uh, does Dr. Pinchelow
have Asperger's?

1294
01:05:00,726 --> 01:05:02,361
Probably.

1295
01:05:02,362 --> 01:05:04,768
I know he doesn't wipe real well.

1296
01:05:08,124 --> 01:05:10,736
Why don't you gentlemen
make yourselves at home.

1297
01:05:10,737 --> 01:05:13,238
I'm gonna go fetch the, uh,
director of the conference,

1298
01:05:13,239 --> 01:05:14,506
Dr. Barbara Walcott.

1299
01:05:14,507 --> 01:05:16,441
She can't wait to meet you.

1300
01:05:16,442 --> 01:05:19,644
Dr. Barbara? A lady doctor? Seriously?

1301
01:05:19,645 --> 01:05:21,914
Lady doctor, that always cracks me up.

1302
01:05:21,915 --> 01:05:24,182
Yeah, doctor of doing the laundry, maybe.

1303
01:05:24,183 --> 01:05:25,183
Am I right?

1304
01:05:27,254 --> 01:05:28,310
I'll be right back.

1305
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:31,457
What were you thinking, Lloyd?

1306
01:05:31,458 --> 01:05:32,892
Now he thinks we're doctors.

1307
01:05:32,893 --> 01:05:34,859
At least we're in the door.

1308
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:36,695
Now all we gotta do is act intelligent.
We'll fit right in.

1309
01:05:36,696 --> 01:05:37,764
Okay.

1310
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,200
Hi, barkeep.

1311
01:05:42,201 --> 01:05:44,104
- How much for a beer?
- It's gratis.

1312
01:05:44,304 --> 01:05:45,571
Ooh.

1313
01:05:45,572 --> 01:05:46,873
That sounds expensive.

1314
01:05:47,873 --> 01:05:50,441
Can you give us a moment?

1315
01:05:50,442 --> 01:05:52,410
Lloyd,
we blew our money on the graduation robes.

1316
01:05:52,411 --> 01:05:53,678
Maybe we shouldn't drink.

1317
01:05:53,679 --> 01:05:55,713
No way. I need booze, man.

1318
01:05:55,714 --> 01:05:57,448
If I meet your daughter without a buzz on,

1319
01:05:57,449 --> 01:05:58,894
she'll think I'm an idiot.

1320
01:06:00,853 --> 01:06:02,787
Hey, wait a minute!

1321
01:06:02,788 --> 01:06:05,557
What about the old Stinkeroo?

1322
01:06:05,558 --> 01:06:07,558
Yeah, I'm in.

1323
01:06:25,412 --> 01:06:27,246
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Yes?

1324
01:06:27,247 --> 01:06:28,514
This beer smells funky.

1325
01:06:28,515 --> 01:06:30,416
Can I have a new one, please?

1326
01:06:30,417 --> 01:06:31,806
What do you mean "funky"?

1327
01:06:32,185 --> 01:06:33,487
Go ahead, take a sniff.

1328
01:06:33,488 --> 01:06:34,524
Ew!

1329
01:06:37,414 --> 01:06:38,692
I'll get you a freshie.

1330
01:06:38,693 --> 01:06:40,566
Mine is stinky, too.

1331
01:06:47,502 --> 01:06:49,503
Yours smells even worse!

1332
01:06:49,504 --> 01:06:51,272
I'll be right back.

1333
01:06:52,272 --> 01:06:54,141
"Yours smells even worse."

1334
01:06:54,142 --> 01:06:55,142
Thanks!

1335
01:06:55,342 --> 01:06:57,110
You're really good at that, Lloyd.

1336
01:06:57,111 --> 01:06:58,445
I learned from the best.

1337
01:06:59,013 --> 01:07:00,547
Thanks, Mom.

1338
01:07:00,548 --> 01:07:02,648
I can't wait to see what's in this.

1339
01:07:02,649 --> 01:07:05,085
- Yeah. Hey, Har?
- Mmm?

1340
01:07:05,086 --> 01:07:08,355
Do you know how long you have to wait
after kidney surgery to have sex?

1341
01:07:08,356 --> 01:07:10,189
I don't think I'll have to wait too long.

1342
01:07:10,190 --> 01:07:12,394
No, not you. I meant the donor chick.

1343
01:07:13,127 --> 01:07:15,461
- What are you talking about?
- Okay! Fine!

1344
01:07:15,462 --> 01:07:17,029
Let's just drop it!

1345
01:07:17,030 --> 01:07:18,465
Here you go, doctors.

1346
01:07:18,466 --> 01:07:19,766
Fresh beers.

1347
01:07:19,767 --> 01:07:23,569
And I also brought you some
hydroponically grown goji berries

1348
01:07:23,570 --> 01:07:25,271
with vegan barbecue sauce

1349
01:07:25,272 --> 01:07:27,474
and some organic pumpkin chips. Enjoy.

1350
01:07:27,475 --> 01:07:28,753
- Why, thank you!
- Mmm.

1351
01:07:30,744 --> 01:07:31,981
Mmm.

1352
01:07:33,981 --> 01:07:35,215
Mmm.

1353
01:07:35,216 --> 01:07:37,050
- These are salty.
- Mmm-hmm.

1354
01:07:37,051 --> 01:07:38,489
Try these.

1355
01:07:41,489 --> 01:07:43,055
Mmm.

1356
01:07:43,056 --> 01:07:44,360
Yours are super tangy.

1357
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:46,360
I like it a lot.

1358
01:07:48,061 --> 01:07:49,195
Gentlemen.

1359
01:07:49,196 --> 01:07:52,064
I'd like you to meet the director of
the conference, Dr. Barbara Walcott.

1360
01:07:52,065 --> 01:07:54,134
And, Barbara, this is Dr. Pinchelow

1361
01:07:54,135 --> 01:07:56,435
and his associate, Dr. Christmas.

1362
01:07:56,436 --> 01:07:59,773
Wonderful.
It is a high honor to meet you both.

1363
01:07:59,774 --> 01:08:02,376
Wow. Great accent, doc. Where you from?

1364
01:08:02,377 --> 01:08:04,110
England. Surrey.

1365
01:08:04,111 --> 01:08:06,613
Oh, no need to apologize.
That was years ago.

1366
01:08:06,614 --> 01:08:09,337
We kicked your butt anyway,
so we're cool with it.

1367
01:08:12,419 --> 01:08:13,753
Oh, you're a leg-puller!

1368
01:08:13,754 --> 01:08:16,590
Let's get you both to your seats.

1369
01:08:16,591 --> 01:08:19,091
Professor Garabedian's KEN
talk is about to begin.

1370
01:08:19,092 --> 01:08:23,095
Now, the existence of dark
matter is largely inferred

1371
01:08:23,096 --> 01:08:26,766
from the gravitational
effect on visible matter

1372
01:08:26,767 --> 01:08:30,604
and the gravitational lensing
of background radiation.

1373
01:08:30,605 --> 01:08:32,471
We saved two seats for you
at the end of the second row.

1374
01:08:32,472 --> 01:08:33,575
Just there.

1375
01:08:35,575 --> 01:08:39,278
...because they were trying to
figure out the discrepancies...

1376
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:40,447
You could actually go in the front.

1377
01:08:40,448 --> 01:08:42,416
- Coming through.
- My bad!

1378
01:08:42,417 --> 01:08:44,083
Here we go. Oops!

1379
01:08:44,084 --> 01:08:46,053
Wow. Is that silk?

1380
01:08:48,288 --> 01:08:49,288
That sucks!

1381
01:08:50,123 --> 01:08:51,493
That's good. Sorry.

1382
01:08:52,493 --> 01:08:53,760
Watch my knee.

1383
01:08:53,761 --> 01:08:56,261
We make a better door than a window,
don't we?

1384
01:08:56,544 --> 01:08:58,600
I hope this isn't your favorite part.

1385
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,734
There are a couple of hotties over here.

1386
01:09:00,735 --> 01:09:02,669
- I got it!
- Oh!

1387
01:09:04,105 --> 01:09:06,706
That was easy!

1388
01:09:06,707 --> 01:09:09,475
That Dr. Pinchelow is certainly
a fascinating character.

1389
01:09:09,476 --> 01:09:12,144
Of course he is. He's a genius.

1390
01:09:12,145 --> 01:09:16,483
Indeed, the Large Hadron
Collider has already shown us

1391
01:09:16,484 --> 01:09:18,618
that dark matter is likely...

1392
01:09:18,619 --> 01:09:20,387
Especially when you eat prunes!

1393
01:09:22,123 --> 01:09:23,622
Yes.

1394
01:09:23,623 --> 01:09:26,360
That dark matter is likely...

1395
01:09:29,230 --> 01:09:31,730
...the missing piece of the puzzle

1396
01:09:31,731 --> 01:09:35,668
that physicists have been searching for,
for years.

1397
01:09:35,669 --> 01:09:38,337
Nerd!

1398
01:09:38,338 --> 01:09:40,306
Nerd! Nerd! Nerd!

1399
01:09:40,307 --> 01:09:42,141
Nerd! Nerd! Nerd!

1400
01:09:42,142 --> 01:09:43,476
Nerd! Nerd! Nerd!

1401
01:09:43,477 --> 01:09:45,213
<i>Excuse me, gentlemen.</i>

1402
01:09:46,213 --> 01:09:47,646
Holy crap!

1403
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:49,082
Did that come from you?

1404
01:09:49,083 --> 01:09:53,252
<i>Dr. Garabedian is a
world-renowned astrophysicist</i>

1405
01:09:53,253 --> 01:09:55,889
<i>and many of us are interested
in hearing his findings.</i>

1406
01:09:55,890 --> 01:09:59,057
- I'm reading his mind. Mmm-hmm.
- I'm picking it up, too.

1407
01:09:59,293 --> 01:10:01,394
Who is that?

1408
01:10:01,395 --> 01:10:02,498
It's Dr. Pinchelow!

1409
01:10:04,498 --> 01:10:07,266
Bernard Pinchelow?

1410
01:10:07,267 --> 01:10:09,836
<i>Dark matter is not a joke.</i>

1411
01:10:09,837 --> 01:10:12,671
<i>Your antics are proving to be disruptive.</i>

1412
01:10:12,672 --> 01:10:15,476
Thank you, Dr. Dilbeck,

1413
01:10:16,476 --> 01:10:18,744
but Dr. Pinchelow is right.

1414
01:10:18,745 --> 01:10:21,745
My dark matter data was insufficient.

1415
01:10:22,182 --> 01:10:23,385
<i>What the fuck?</i>

1416
01:10:24,385 --> 01:10:26,687
My methods were sloppy.

1417
01:10:27,687 --> 01:10:29,687
I'm a hack.

1418
01:10:30,525 --> 01:10:31,896
I'm really sorry.

1419
01:10:35,896 --> 01:10:37,264
See?

1420
01:10:37,265 --> 01:10:39,431
- <i>Eat me.</i>
- Suck it!

1421
01:10:39,432 --> 01:10:41,534
- <i>You wish.</i>
- Lloyd. Lloyd.

1422
01:10:41,535 --> 01:10:44,604
<i>Thank you, Professor Garabedian.</i>

1423
01:10:44,605 --> 01:10:46,672
<i>That's what the KEN
Conference is all about.</i>

1424
01:10:46,673 --> 01:10:47,774
<i>Truth.</i>

1425
01:10:47,775 --> 01:10:49,943
<i>But I will ask that everyone please behave</i>

1426
01:10:49,944 --> 01:10:51,744
<i>in a professional and dignified...</i>

1427
01:10:51,745 --> 01:10:53,446
Show us your tits!

1428
01:10:54,781 --> 01:10:57,617
- Both of them!
- Yeah!

1429
01:10:57,618 --> 01:11:00,785
<i>We're just gonna take a short
two-minute break. Thank you!</i>

1430
01:11:01,756 --> 01:11:02,956
Man.

1431
01:11:02,957 --> 01:11:04,457
Hey, this is great!

1432
01:11:04,458 --> 01:11:06,736
We're learning so much about dark matter.

1433
01:11:08,529 --> 01:11:09,695
Yes, indeed.

1434
01:11:09,696 --> 01:11:10,863
Uh, I'm sorry, Dr. Pinchelow,

1435
01:11:10,864 --> 01:11:14,234
but we can't seem to find
Dr. Christmas on the roster.

1436
01:11:14,235 --> 01:11:16,435
Oh, that's okay. He's with me.

1437
01:11:16,436 --> 01:11:20,372
Due to security concerns everyone
must be on the list to get in.

1438
01:11:20,373 --> 01:11:22,876
It's all right, Doctor.

1439
01:11:22,877 --> 01:11:25,278
I think I know a shakedown when I see one.

1440
01:11:25,279 --> 01:11:26,746
I'll tell you what.

1441
01:11:26,747 --> 01:11:30,449
I'm gonna write an IOU and
I'm gonna leave it blank.

1442
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:31,650
Anybody have a pen?

1443
01:11:31,651 --> 01:11:34,653
There are no exceptions.

1444
01:11:34,654 --> 01:11:35,956
Really?

1445
01:11:35,957 --> 01:11:37,489
I'll tell you what, warden.

1446
01:11:37,490 --> 01:11:38,891
If I'm leaving,

1447
01:11:38,892 --> 01:11:41,394
then my steamed colleague
is leaving with me.

1448
01:11:41,395 --> 01:11:42,731
No, he's not.

1449
01:11:44,731 --> 01:11:45,731
Quick conference.

1450
01:11:49,604 --> 01:11:51,371
What are you doing, Har?

1451
01:11:51,372 --> 01:11:53,672
- You're killing me!
- Lloyd, I can't leave.

1452
01:11:53,673 --> 01:11:56,443
Penny is gonna be speaking soon.
I wanna meet her!

1453
01:11:56,444 --> 01:11:57,444
What?

1454
01:11:57,811 --> 01:12:00,089
How come you get to meet her before I do?

1455
01:12:00,513 --> 01:12:02,681
Lloyd, this is about me.

1456
01:12:02,682 --> 01:12:04,283
Me, my daughter and my kidney.

1457
01:12:04,284 --> 01:12:05,918
That's why we're here, remember?

1458
01:12:05,919 --> 01:12:07,953
How can I forget?
It's all you ever talk about.

1459
01:12:07,954 --> 01:12:09,154
Penny and my kidney. My kidney and Penny.

1460
01:12:09,155 --> 01:12:11,592
To tell you the truth,
I'm getting a little sick of it.

1461
01:12:11,792 --> 01:12:12,958
Wait a minute.

1462
01:12:12,959 --> 01:12:14,793
I know what you're up to, mister.

1463
01:12:15,941 --> 01:12:18,664
You wanna stay because
you're hot for my daughter!

1464
01:12:18,665 --> 01:12:19,832
- What?
- Am I right?

1465
01:12:19,833 --> 01:12:21,333
- What?
- Am I right?

1466
01:12:21,334 --> 01:12:23,603
- That's insane!
- Don't deny it, Lloyd!

1467
01:12:23,803 --> 01:12:25,438
You have been drooling over her

1468
01:12:25,439 --> 01:12:27,306
ever since you first saw her picture.

1469
01:12:27,307 --> 01:12:28,609
So what?

1470
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:31,310
I'm not gonna apologize for letting
nature take its course, Har.

1471
01:12:31,311 --> 01:12:33,345
I hate to burst your butthole, mister.

1472
01:12:33,346 --> 01:12:34,569
It ain't gonna happen.

1473
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:36,949
It's my job to protect my daughter.

1474
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:38,652
Protect her?

1475
01:12:38,653 --> 01:12:40,019
Look who's talking!

1476
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:41,988
You're trying to swindle
her out of a kidney!

1477
01:12:41,989 --> 01:12:43,601
At least I'm gonna marry her.

1478
01:12:45,525 --> 01:12:46,693
Marry her? No.

1479
01:12:46,694 --> 01:12:48,862
- You're not gonna marry.
- Why not?

1480
01:12:48,863 --> 01:12:51,864
No! Lloyd,
you are not going to marry my daughter.

1481
01:12:51,865 --> 01:12:54,533
Why? Because she's a tick younger than me?
Get over it.

1482
01:12:54,534 --> 01:12:56,002
Age is just a letter, man.

1483
01:12:56,003 --> 01:12:59,408
It's got nothing to do with age!
It's got to do...

1484
01:13:00,408 --> 01:13:01,479
With what?

1485
01:13:05,479 --> 01:13:06,702
I'm her father, Lloyd,

1486
01:13:09,583 --> 01:13:10,583
and, frankly,

1487
01:13:13,854 --> 01:13:15,299
I think she can do better.

1488
01:13:16,923 --> 01:13:18,596
Oh...

1489
01:13:22,596 --> 01:13:23,802
Okay.

1490
01:13:36,476 --> 01:13:38,744
- Time to go, Doctor.
- All right, buddy.

1491
01:13:38,745 --> 01:13:39,850
- Harry?
- Let's go.

1492
01:13:42,850 --> 01:13:44,520
Harry?

1493
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:47,658
Harry?

1494
01:13:50,658 --> 01:13:52,859
Dr. Walcott just had a wonderful idea.

1495
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:54,027
How would you like to come with us

1496
01:13:54,028 --> 01:13:56,362
and judge the Young Inventors competition?

1497
01:13:58,833 --> 01:14:00,445
Yeah, cool. Let's judge shit.

1498
01:14:01,135 --> 01:14:02,511
Hey! Hey!

1499
01:14:10,511 --> 01:14:12,678
So this is what rock bottom feels like.

1500
01:14:14,515 --> 01:14:16,717
Mmm, not that bad.

1501
01:14:22,155 --> 01:14:23,689
Hello?

1502
01:14:23,690 --> 01:14:25,425
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

1503
01:14:25,426 --> 01:14:26,426
Hello?

1504
01:14:26,961 --> 01:14:28,461
Penny?

1505
01:14:28,462 --> 01:14:30,430
I can't hear you, you're breaking up.

1506
01:14:30,431 --> 01:14:31,732
Penny?

1507
01:14:32,732 --> 01:14:36,034
Penny! How's this?

1508
01:14:36,035 --> 01:14:39,006
<i>Just hang on. Don't go anywhere.</i>

1509
01:14:43,577 --> 01:14:44,743
<i>Can you hear me now?</i>

1510
01:14:44,744 --> 01:14:46,613
Yes, I can hear you now.

1511
01:14:46,614 --> 01:14:48,816
Good! I can hear you loud and clear.

1512
01:14:49,816 --> 01:14:52,719
This is Lloyd, your dad's good buddy.

1513
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:56,021
Unfortunately,
I don't have him at the moment,

1514
01:14:56,022 --> 01:14:59,525
but, uh, he wanted me to ask you
to find a nice, romantic place

1515
01:14:59,526 --> 01:15:00,829
where we can all meet.

1516
01:15:02,829 --> 01:15:05,664
No, by "romantic" I meant convenient.

1517
01:15:05,665 --> 01:15:08,832
And it has to be some place
outside the convention center.

1518
01:15:11,172 --> 01:15:14,674
The fountain? On Main Street?
In 10 minutes?

1519
01:15:14,675 --> 01:15:15,675
Perfect!

1520
01:15:17,144 --> 01:15:18,978
Yes!

1521
01:15:18,979 --> 01:15:20,947
It's marvelous to meet you, Mrs. Pinchelow.

1522
01:15:20,948 --> 01:15:22,715
I trust you had a safe journey in?

1523
01:15:22,716 --> 01:15:24,451
It was lovely.

1524
01:15:24,452 --> 01:15:26,586
Great. We have a seat saved
for you in the front row.

1525
01:15:26,587 --> 01:15:29,189
We're just about to introduce
your charming husband.

1526
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:32,158
My husband?

1527
01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:33,926
<i>So let's give a warm, welcome</i>

1528
01:15:33,927 --> 01:15:35,862
<i>to our very distinguished judge,</i>

1529
01:15:35,863 --> 01:15:37,998
<i>Dr. Bernard Pinchelow.</i>

1530
01:16:23,910 --> 01:16:25,078
Hi!

1531
01:16:25,079 --> 01:16:26,248
Hello!

1532
01:16:28,248 --> 01:16:29,882
How about a hug?

1533
01:16:29,883 --> 01:16:31,752
Sure!

1534
01:16:35,189 --> 01:16:36,190
Oh!

1535
01:16:37,190 --> 01:16:39,091
I love hellos.

1536
01:16:39,092 --> 01:16:40,927
Oh, me, too.

1537
01:16:45,031 --> 01:16:46,131
Wow!

1538
01:16:46,132 --> 01:16:47,500
You're really sweet, mister,

1539
01:16:47,501 --> 01:16:51,113
but I'm waiting for my dad and his friend,
so if you'll excuse me.

1540
01:16:51,939 --> 01:16:55,574
No, it's me, Lloyd!

1541
01:16:55,575 --> 01:16:57,210
Hi, Lloyd, I'm Penny.

1542
01:16:57,211 --> 01:16:59,211
Oh! Lloyd! Hi!

1543
01:16:59,747 --> 01:17:01,181
It's so nice to meet you!

1544
01:17:02,181 --> 01:17:05,083
Um, where's my dad?

1545
01:17:05,084 --> 01:17:08,720
Uh, he was delayed, so,
uh, he asked me to come by

1546
01:17:08,721 --> 01:17:09,856
and entertain you...

1547
01:17:13,827 --> 01:17:16,194
...until he can meet up with us.

1548
01:17:16,195 --> 01:17:18,695
I think he wanted us to
have a chance to bond.

1549
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:21,266
James Bond.

1550
01:17:21,267 --> 01:17:22,902
Great!

1551
01:17:22,903 --> 01:17:24,604
Are you hungry?
Can I get you something to eat?

1552
01:17:24,605 --> 01:17:26,639
Sure!

1553
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:27,640
Awesome!

1554
01:17:32,212 --> 01:17:33,845
Wow!

1555
01:17:33,846 --> 01:17:35,081
We can go somewhere nice.

1556
01:17:35,082 --> 01:17:36,082
Sounds yummy!

1557
01:17:37,851 --> 01:17:39,351
Here, try this.

1558
01:17:39,352 --> 01:17:41,354
This is incredible popcorn.

1559
01:17:41,355 --> 01:17:44,356
And I know popcorn.
I'm the second-best popcorn maker I know.

1560
01:17:44,357 --> 01:17:46,693
All right, I'll take the bait.
Who's the third-best?

1561
01:17:46,694 --> 01:17:49,896
I know, right? I've always wondered that!

1562
01:17:51,966 --> 01:17:53,267
Shrub club!

1563
01:17:54,267 --> 01:17:56,069
Sorry!

1564
01:17:56,070 --> 01:17:59,005
It's just this game that I
play with my friends back home.

1565
01:17:59,205 --> 01:18:00,205
I love you!

1566
01:18:01,175 --> 01:18:02,209
What?

1567
01:18:03,209 --> 01:18:04,209
Um...

1568
01:18:04,811 --> 01:18:08,146
That's a direct quote, from your dad.

1569
01:18:08,147 --> 01:18:09,282
"I love you."

1570
01:18:09,283 --> 01:18:10,649
His words.

1571
01:18:10,650 --> 01:18:12,318
Hey, wait a second.

1572
01:18:12,319 --> 01:18:14,386
How do I even know that you know my dad?

1573
01:18:14,387 --> 01:18:16,288
You could be one of those foreign
guys who always calls me up

1574
01:18:16,289 --> 01:18:17,991
and makes me get undressed
in front of the computer

1575
01:18:17,992 --> 01:18:19,658
because he lost his passports and money.

1576
01:18:19,659 --> 01:18:21,793
No, no, that's not me.

1577
01:18:21,794 --> 01:18:23,330
Look, I can prove it.

1578
01:18:24,330 --> 01:18:25,998
I have your cell phone.

1579
01:18:25,999 --> 01:18:29,270
Oh, my gosh!
No wonder no one's been calling me!

1580
01:18:30,270 --> 01:18:32,238
Oh.

1581
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:34,073
I, uh, plugged my number in there

1582
01:18:34,408 --> 01:18:38,043
in case you need me late at night.

1583
01:18:38,044 --> 01:18:41,989
Oh, and we brought your box.
You left it at the house, you stupid idiot.

1584
01:18:42,189 --> 01:18:43,882
Hey, you wanna see something neat?

1585
01:18:43,883 --> 01:18:44,883
Okay!

1586
01:18:50,458 --> 01:18:54,793
Wait, are you sure that it's okay
for birds to be eating Pop Rocks?

1587
01:18:54,794 --> 01:18:57,063
I mean, you'd think it would
be bad for their teeth.

1588
01:18:57,064 --> 01:19:00,198
Nah! That's just a suburban legend.

1589
01:19:00,199 --> 01:19:01,199
Oh.

1590
01:19:03,070 --> 01:19:04,441
Shit!

1591
01:19:08,441 --> 01:19:11,877
Spontaneous combustion,
however, totally real.

1592
01:19:11,878 --> 01:19:13,449
Oh.

1593
01:19:16,751 --> 01:19:19,418
- What?
<i>- You gotta get back here right now.</i>

1594
01:19:19,419 --> 01:19:21,086
One of those idiots is in the building

1595
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:23,155
and he's pretending to be my husband!

1596
01:19:23,156 --> 01:19:25,291
Why don't you tell them
he's not your husband?

1597
01:19:25,292 --> 01:19:27,393
Because I don't even
know what they're up to.

1598
01:19:27,394 --> 01:19:29,394
He must be trying to sell the box.

1599
01:19:29,395 --> 01:19:30,832
Just get back here!

1600
01:19:31,832 --> 01:19:35,301
This microscopic robot, or nanobot

1601
01:19:35,302 --> 01:19:37,136
can be injected into the human body

1602
01:19:37,137 --> 01:19:40,473
to detect and cure cancer.

1603
01:19:41,874 --> 01:19:42,910
Interesting.

1604
01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:44,910
Can it sing?

1605
01:19:46,413 --> 01:19:47,880
Uh...

1606
01:19:47,881 --> 01:19:49,414
What?

1607
01:19:49,415 --> 01:19:51,818
They got a large-mouth bass now
that you hang it on the wall.

1608
01:19:51,819 --> 01:19:54,721
When you walk past it,
it sings <i>Take Me to the River.</i>

1609
01:19:59,325 --> 01:20:01,793
- Are you saying...
- What I'm saying is,

1610
01:20:01,794 --> 01:20:03,762
you're this close,

1611
01:20:03,763 --> 01:20:05,997
but there's a drawing board
you should be getting back to.

1612
01:20:05,998 --> 01:20:06,998
Next!

1613
01:20:08,435 --> 01:20:09,910
But it cures cancer.

1614
01:20:20,114 --> 01:20:21,418
<i>Ni hao.</i>

1615
01:20:25,418 --> 01:20:26,953
Listen to this.

1616
01:20:26,954 --> 01:20:29,255
"You will do important
things in the world."

1617
01:20:29,256 --> 01:20:30,556
That's so weird

1618
01:20:30,557 --> 01:20:33,192
because I actually want to do
important things in the world.

1619
01:20:33,193 --> 01:20:35,994
Wow. That's neat.

1620
01:20:35,995 --> 01:20:38,096
Someday, I wanna do important things, too.

1621
01:20:38,097 --> 01:20:39,209
Oh, yeah? Like what?

1622
01:20:41,546 --> 01:20:43,769
I'm thinking about getting new speakers.

1623
01:20:43,770 --> 01:20:45,770
Oh.

1624
01:20:46,073 --> 01:20:47,907
I've always wanted to go to India

1625
01:20:47,908 --> 01:20:50,542
and volunteer at one of
those leprechaun colonies.

1626
01:20:50,543 --> 01:20:52,511
I think you mean Ireland.

1627
01:20:52,512 --> 01:20:54,146
Oh.

1628
01:20:54,147 --> 01:20:55,985
So what does your cookie say?

1629
01:20:57,985 --> 01:20:59,918
"You will have an amazing romance

1630
01:20:59,919 --> 01:21:02,556
"with the person sitted across from you."

1631
01:21:04,324 --> 01:21:06,525
It's a good thing I'm not your uncle.

1632
01:21:06,526 --> 01:21:09,228
"And don't be concerned
about the age difference.

1633
01:21:09,229 --> 01:21:11,229
"Just shut up and make out.

1634
01:21:11,230 --> 01:21:14,433
"It will all sort itself out later.
You'll see!"

1635
01:21:14,434 --> 01:21:16,934
That's ridiculously specific.
Let me see that.

1636
01:21:18,204 --> 01:21:20,538
If you don't eat it, it doesn't come true.

1637
01:21:23,843 --> 01:21:25,177
Hey, where's my dad?

1638
01:21:25,178 --> 01:21:26,546
Do you know if Adele came with him?

1639
01:21:26,547 --> 01:21:28,381
She's probably the one slowing him down.

1640
01:21:28,382 --> 01:21:29,382
Adele?

1641
01:21:29,816 --> 01:21:31,084
His wife.

1642
01:21:31,874 --> 01:21:33,319
Harry doesn't have a wife.

1643
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:34,355
Who's Harry?

1644
01:21:35,355 --> 01:21:36,555
Your father.

1645
01:21:36,556 --> 01:21:37,823
My father's name's not Harry.

1646
01:21:37,824 --> 01:21:39,091
It's Bernard.

1647
01:21:39,092 --> 01:21:41,327
Oh, yeah,
but I'm talking about your real dad.

1648
01:21:41,328 --> 01:21:42,561
Harry Dunne!

1649
01:21:42,562 --> 01:21:45,430
The guy who abandoned you when
you were a little, tiny baby.

1650
01:21:45,431 --> 01:21:46,654
You're gonna love him!

1651
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:49,268
Wait a second.

1652
01:21:49,269 --> 01:21:50,903
So you're saying we're
supposed to be meeting

1653
01:21:50,904 --> 01:21:52,505
my biographical father?

1654
01:21:52,506 --> 01:21:53,573
Yes.

1655
01:21:53,574 --> 01:21:55,541
Here.

1656
01:21:55,542 --> 01:21:58,578
This is a letter from your real mother,
Fraida, that you sent back to her.

1657
01:21:58,579 --> 01:22:00,046
Nice.

1658
01:22:00,047 --> 01:22:01,325
"Do not contact again."

1659
01:22:02,104 --> 01:22:03,549
This isn't my handwriting.

1660
01:22:03,550 --> 01:22:05,055
I don't even know cursive.

1661
01:22:08,055 --> 01:22:11,157
"Dear daughter,
I gave you up for adoption 18 years ago

1662
01:22:11,158 --> 01:22:13,426
"because I thought it was
the right thing to do.

1663
01:22:13,427 --> 01:22:15,994
"I hope and pray I made
the correct decision.

1664
01:22:15,995 --> 01:22:18,296
"You were conceived in Rhode
Island on a chilly autumn night

1665
01:22:18,297 --> 01:22:20,533
"in the parking lot at Oyster Swallow Cove.

1666
01:22:20,534 --> 01:22:23,469
"We were young and stupid, especially him."

1667
01:22:23,470 --> 01:22:25,512
Oyster Swallow Cove?

1668
01:22:31,712 --> 01:22:33,713
Are you ready, baby?

1669
01:22:37,085 --> 01:22:38,184
Mmm-hmm.

1670
01:22:38,185 --> 01:22:39,719
Whoa! Whoa!

1671
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:41,153
Slow down.

1672
01:22:41,154 --> 01:22:42,599
Let's be responsible here.

1673
01:22:43,190 --> 01:22:44,635
I brought some protection.

1674
01:22:49,630 --> 01:22:51,667
Let's do this.

1675
01:22:55,504 --> 01:22:58,804
"So, if you ever wanna get in touch,
I would love to meet you.

1676
01:22:58,805 --> 01:23:01,711
"All my love, Fraida Felcher, your mom."

1677
01:23:03,711 --> 01:23:05,480
That means I'm your...

1678
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:07,714
And we almost...

1679
01:23:07,715 --> 01:23:09,318
Lloyd? Are you okay?

1680
01:23:11,142 --> 01:23:14,254
I'm sorry, Lloyd,
but I gotta get back to the convention.

1681
01:23:14,255 --> 01:23:17,256
I'm supposed to be giving a big
speech for my dad any minute.

1682
01:23:17,257 --> 01:23:18,724
But, wait. We have so much to talk about.

1683
01:23:18,725 --> 01:23:19,792
It's an emergency!

1684
01:23:19,793 --> 01:23:22,261
It's all a big misunderstanding!
I've gotta go!

1685
01:23:22,262 --> 01:23:23,563
Not dressed like that, you're not!

1686
01:23:23,564 --> 01:23:24,869
You're grounded!

1687
01:23:28,869 --> 01:23:30,336
Wait a minute.

1688
01:23:30,337 --> 01:23:31,337
If she's my kid,

1689
01:23:33,306 --> 01:23:35,442
then she's not Harry's kid,

1690
01:23:35,443 --> 01:23:37,247
and he can't take her kidneys.

1691
01:23:39,247 --> 01:23:40,555
What have I done?

1692
01:23:48,555 --> 01:23:50,223
Hi, I need to get in.

1693
01:23:50,224 --> 01:23:51,524
Credentials, please?

1694
01:23:51,525 --> 01:23:52,859
Oh, I'm giving a speech.

1695
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:55,594
Credentials, please.

1696
01:23:55,595 --> 01:23:56,696
What is that?

1697
01:23:56,697 --> 01:24:00,300
Is it that thingy that they
gave me to get in here?

1698
01:24:00,301 --> 01:24:02,269
I think I've got it here, somewhere.

1699
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:05,938
Mister, I am appealing to
your sense of God and family.

1700
01:24:05,939 --> 01:24:07,374
I got a message that my daughter,

1701
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:09,608
who I have not seen in 22 years,

1702
01:24:09,609 --> 01:24:10,876
is in there.

1703
01:24:10,877 --> 01:24:12,845
The event will be letting out soon.

1704
01:24:12,846 --> 01:24:16,249
After 22 years,
what's another couple of hours, right?

1705
01:24:16,250 --> 01:24:17,819
Okay, buddy.

1706
01:24:18,819 --> 01:24:20,819
There's got to be a, uh,

1707
01:24:20,820 --> 01:24:23,523
broom closet around here somewhere, huh?

1708
01:24:23,524 --> 01:24:26,862
I'm sure we could work something out.

1709
01:24:27,862 --> 01:24:31,230
I didn't take 34 years
to come out of the closet

1710
01:24:31,231 --> 01:24:32,465
just to go back into one

1711
01:24:32,466 --> 01:24:35,501
with you.

1712
01:24:35,502 --> 01:24:39,939
Okay, this device will give us a visual
rendering of your cognitive processes.

1713
01:24:39,940 --> 01:24:41,875
Could you repeat the question?

1714
01:24:41,876 --> 01:24:44,577
This device will show us what he's thinking

1715
01:24:44,578 --> 01:24:45,947
right on this screen.

1716
01:24:47,247 --> 01:24:48,614
Yeah, really.

1717
01:24:48,615 --> 01:24:50,951
Go ahead, Dr. Pinchelow.

1718
01:24:50,952 --> 01:24:53,952
Think of a pleasant memory
from your childhood.

1719
01:24:53,953 --> 01:24:54,953
Okay.

1720
01:25:11,972 --> 01:25:13,473
Oh!

1721
01:25:13,474 --> 01:25:14,474
<i>Here, Biscuit!</i>

1722
01:25:15,309 --> 01:25:16,840
<i>Biscuit, come here, boy.</i>

1723
01:25:18,311 --> 01:25:19,978
<i>The door, buddy. Get the door.</i>

1724
01:25:28,256 --> 01:25:29,489
Oh, okay.

1725
01:25:31,826 --> 01:25:34,426
No! This gadget is way off!

1726
01:25:34,427 --> 01:25:36,896
First of all, my bedspread was orange.

1727
01:25:51,845 --> 01:25:53,513
Are you okay, honey?

1728
01:25:53,514 --> 01:25:55,047
No, not really.

1729
01:25:55,048 --> 01:25:56,515
Boyfriend trouble?

1730
01:25:56,516 --> 01:25:58,885
No. I need a ticket to get in

1731
01:25:58,886 --> 01:26:01,720
and I lost the ticket that they
need to take, plus, I lost my pass.

1732
01:26:01,721 --> 01:26:03,989
And I thought that I grabbed it,
but when I looked in my purse,

1733
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:05,658
all I saw was the toothbrush.
So maybe I took...

1734
01:26:05,659 --> 01:26:06,659
Okay, okay, okay.

1735
01:26:08,328 --> 01:26:09,331
All right.

1736
01:26:10,331 --> 01:26:11,398
What's going on?

1737
01:26:11,399 --> 01:26:13,801
My father's supposed to
be getting a huge reward,

1738
01:26:14,001 --> 01:26:15,769
and I'm supposed to be making the speech,

1739
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:16,937
and the speech is supposed
to start right now,

1740
01:26:16,938 --> 01:26:19,883
and there's no way they'll
let me in without a ticket.

1741
01:26:20,975 --> 01:26:22,411
Oh, honey.

1742
01:26:23,411 --> 01:26:25,417
There is always a way.

1743
01:26:29,417 --> 01:26:31,350
I admit, it's thought-provoking.

1744
01:26:31,351 --> 01:26:33,586
An invention that ends world hunger.

1745
01:26:33,587 --> 01:26:35,921
But, have you considered this,

1746
01:26:35,922 --> 01:26:37,756
where does all the extra poop go?

1747
01:26:38,658 --> 01:26:39,925
What? No.

1748
01:26:39,926 --> 01:26:41,694
The point is that there's no more hunger.

1749
01:26:41,695 --> 01:26:43,929
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.
We're gonna take a very brief break.

1750
01:26:43,930 --> 01:26:45,064
Uh, please stay in your seats

1751
01:26:45,065 --> 01:26:46,899
and we will resume, uh, shortly.

1752
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:48,434
Why?

1753
01:26:48,435 --> 01:26:49,736
We're gonna have to take a walk.

1754
01:26:49,737 --> 01:26:51,537
- Come on.
- I'm judging.

1755
01:26:51,538 --> 01:26:52,839
- You're out of here.
- Okay!

1756
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:54,340
You're out.

1757
01:26:54,341 --> 01:26:55,709
Mrs. P,

1758
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:56,809
what are you doing here?

1759
01:26:56,810 --> 01:26:59,381
Do you always call your wife Mrs. P?

1760
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:01,850
Oh, uh...

1761
01:27:02,661 --> 01:27:04,884
How you doing, sugar tits? I missed you.

1762
01:27:04,885 --> 01:27:06,719
This man is a fraud.

1763
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:09,054
And that box belongs to my husband.

1764
01:27:09,055 --> 01:27:10,389
He stole it from us.

1765
01:27:10,390 --> 01:27:11,457
Hand it over, buddy.

1766
01:27:11,458 --> 01:27:13,760
Uh-uh. I swore I'd only
give this box to Penny.

1767
01:27:13,761 --> 01:27:15,539
- Give me the box!
- Here you go.

1768
01:27:20,837 --> 01:27:22,837
- What's happening?
- I have no idea.

1769
01:27:23,037 --> 01:27:24,571
Hey!

1770
01:27:24,572 --> 01:27:26,739
Hey, hey! Get back here!

1771
01:27:26,740 --> 01:27:28,478
Out of my way!

1772
01:27:30,478 --> 01:27:32,711
Thanks a lot, lady!

1773
01:27:32,712 --> 01:27:34,157
It's the least I could do.

1774
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:44,456
There's something I need to tell you.

1775
01:27:44,457 --> 01:27:45,457
You're my...

1776
01:27:47,906 --> 01:27:49,629
Okay. The reason I'm here is...

1777
01:27:49,630 --> 01:27:50,964
Fraida!

1778
01:27:50,965 --> 01:27:52,465
Harry?

1779
01:27:52,466 --> 01:27:53,603
- You made it!
- Oh!

1780
01:27:55,603 --> 01:27:56,971
Oh, and you found Penny.

1781
01:27:57,971 --> 01:27:59,416
Hey, how do you know my...

1782
01:27:59,706 --> 01:28:02,241
Oh! You're Harry?

1783
01:28:02,242 --> 01:28:04,479
Yes! And I'm your mother!

1784
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:07,880
He's got a gun!

1785
01:29:02,937 --> 01:29:05,205
Why you standing in the toilet?

1786
01:29:05,206 --> 01:29:07,406
So you wouldn't see my feet.

1787
01:29:07,407 --> 01:29:08,741
Why not just stand on the rim?

1788
01:29:08,742 --> 01:29:10,777
There's ball hairs all over that thing.

1789
01:29:10,778 --> 01:29:11,781
I'm not stupid.

1790
01:29:13,781 --> 01:29:15,226
Get out of there! Move it!

1791
01:29:15,849 --> 01:29:17,385
Now!

1792
01:29:18,385 --> 01:29:20,253
Please don't hurt Penny, Mrs. P.

1793
01:29:20,254 --> 01:29:23,356
She's young and still has most
of her future ahead of her.

1794
01:29:23,357 --> 01:29:24,357
Get the box.

1795
01:29:27,295 --> 01:29:30,496
Harry! There you are!

1796
01:29:30,497 --> 01:29:31,775
Good thing you're loud.

1797
01:29:33,733 --> 01:29:35,302
What are you doing, Mrs. P?

1798
01:29:35,303 --> 01:29:36,503
I'm about to kill you.

1799
01:29:36,703 --> 01:29:38,871
Wait, wait, wait!

1800
01:29:38,872 --> 01:29:40,506
Can't you kill someone else?

1801
01:29:40,507 --> 01:29:42,342
My daughter, Penny, needs me now.

1802
01:29:42,343 --> 01:29:44,577
What are you talking about, Lloyd?
Penny's my daughter.

1803
01:29:44,578 --> 01:29:46,478
- No, Harry, she isn't.
- Mmm-mmm.

1804
01:29:46,479 --> 01:29:47,847
What?

1805
01:29:47,848 --> 01:29:50,517
Why would you think that
she's your daughter?

1806
01:29:50,518 --> 01:29:52,885
Because of the postcard.

1807
01:29:52,886 --> 01:29:55,589
I was about to be a single
mom and I needed money.

1808
01:29:55,590 --> 01:29:57,389
And you owed me 40 bucks

1809
01:29:57,390 --> 01:29:59,928
from that stupid worm farm loan.

1810
01:30:00,928 --> 01:30:02,430
It's true, Har.

1811
01:30:03,430 --> 01:30:05,632
I'm the deadbeat dad, not you.

1812
01:30:06,834 --> 01:30:08,803
I'm Penny's baby-papa.

1813
01:30:10,004 --> 01:30:12,272
But don't judge me till you see this.

1814
01:30:12,273 --> 01:30:15,241
Oh, yeah, like a cooler of cold brewskies

1815
01:30:15,242 --> 01:30:16,809
is gonna make everything okay!

1816
01:30:16,810 --> 01:30:18,477
It's not beer, it's my kidney!

1817
01:30:21,483 --> 01:30:22,785
Your kidney?

1818
01:30:23,785 --> 01:30:25,121
I figured

1819
01:30:26,121 --> 01:30:29,188
since you can't get one from Penny,

1820
01:30:29,189 --> 01:30:30,634
I'd give it to you myself.

1821
01:30:31,326 --> 01:30:33,062
Holy shit.

1822
01:30:34,062 --> 01:30:35,896
How did you get this?

1823
01:30:35,897 --> 01:30:39,098
I crossed the border into Mexico.

1824
01:30:39,099 --> 01:30:42,469
Turns out, the medical regs are
a little more chill down there.

1825
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:45,371
Pardon me for bringing this up,
but I don't give a shit!

1826
01:30:45,372 --> 01:30:48,042
Yeah, but, Lloyd,
she isn't your daughter either.

1827
01:30:49,042 --> 01:30:51,044
Nice try, Fraida,

1828
01:30:51,045 --> 01:30:52,657
but Penny read me the letter.

1829
01:30:53,214 --> 01:30:55,314
I know all about Oyster Swallow Cove,

1830
01:30:55,315 --> 01:30:57,183
which is exactly where
you took me in the van!

1831
01:30:57,184 --> 01:30:58,384
So?

1832
01:30:58,385 --> 01:31:00,821
That was my spot.

1833
01:31:00,822 --> 01:31:03,100
I must have taken hundreds of guys there.

1834
01:31:04,392 --> 01:31:05,861
What can I say?

1835
01:31:06,861 --> 01:31:08,229
I was a titanic whore.

1836
01:31:09,229 --> 01:31:11,397
That's enough bullshit.

1837
01:31:11,398 --> 01:31:13,176
Go ahead, Lippincott, kill them.

1838
01:31:14,135 --> 01:31:16,236
Oh, I will.

1839
01:31:16,237 --> 01:31:19,039
But first, why don't you join them.

1840
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:21,942
- What?
- You heard me. Drop it!

1841
01:31:21,943 --> 01:31:23,509
Get over there! Get over there!

1842
01:31:23,510 --> 01:31:25,848
You're kidding. She's on our team now?

1843
01:31:26,603 --> 01:31:28,048
Don't do this, Lippincott.

1844
01:31:28,049 --> 01:31:29,516
You're a military man.

1845
01:31:29,517 --> 01:31:31,906
I know you've got more integrity than this!

1846
01:31:34,354 --> 01:31:35,555
What is this?

1847
01:31:35,556 --> 01:31:37,191
Huh?

1848
01:31:37,192 --> 01:31:39,358
Two cupcakes?

1849
01:31:39,359 --> 01:31:41,294
Actually, there were four cupcakes, sir.

1850
01:31:41,295 --> 01:31:43,296
- I ate the two chocolate ones.
- Lloyd!

1851
01:31:43,297 --> 01:31:45,432
It's okay.
I left the vanilla ones for humanity.

1852
01:31:45,433 --> 01:31:47,534
Where's the invention?

1853
01:31:47,535 --> 01:31:50,071
Where's the goddamn
billion-dollar invention?

1854
01:31:51,238 --> 01:31:53,173
Put the gun down! Freeze!

1855
01:31:53,174 --> 01:31:54,786
Put the gun down, Lippincott!

1856
01:32:00,014 --> 01:32:02,014
Well! Hello.

1857
01:32:02,015 --> 01:32:03,383
Dad!

1858
01:32:03,384 --> 01:32:06,085
Bernard. Oh, thank God you're here.

1859
01:32:06,086 --> 01:32:07,920
God, and you're okay!

1860
01:32:07,921 --> 01:32:09,121
Stop right there.

1861
01:32:09,122 --> 01:32:10,256
What?

1862
01:32:10,257 --> 01:32:11,858
I appreciate your concern, Adele,

1863
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:13,594
but it's a little late for that.

1864
01:32:13,595 --> 01:32:15,062
You see...

1865
01:32:15,063 --> 01:32:16,330
I couldn't stop wondering

1866
01:32:16,331 --> 01:32:18,564
why every time I ate your cooking,
I was getting sicker.

1867
01:32:18,565 --> 01:32:20,200
And then when Harry and Lloyd showed me

1868
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:21,500
the letter from Penny's birth mother,

1869
01:32:21,501 --> 01:32:23,135
I recognized that the handwriting

1870
01:32:23,136 --> 01:32:25,438
sending it back was yours.

1871
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:27,641
And the cruelty of this got me to thinking.

1872
01:32:27,642 --> 01:32:31,445
So I laid a little trap,
and lo and behold, you took the bait

1873
01:32:31,446 --> 01:32:33,558
like the toe-sucking rat that you are.

1874
01:32:34,181 --> 01:32:35,915
After you left for El Paso,

1875
01:32:35,916 --> 01:32:38,151
I called the FBI to make
sure Penny was protected.

1876
01:32:38,152 --> 01:32:40,353
I thought those Canadian
accents were a little shaky.

1877
01:32:40,354 --> 01:32:43,122
Yeah? You try it.

1878
01:32:43,123 --> 01:32:45,125
But what about the invention?

1879
01:32:45,126 --> 01:32:47,361
It was just cupcakes.

1880
01:32:47,362 --> 01:32:49,495
A gift for Dr. Barbara Walcott

1881
01:32:49,496 --> 01:32:51,464
for my having canceled at the last moment.

1882
01:32:51,465 --> 01:32:52,767
This is great, Dad!

1883
01:32:52,768 --> 01:32:55,902
Now you can pick up your Lifetime
Achievement reward in person!

1884
01:32:55,903 --> 01:32:57,626
It's "award," you stupid bitch!

1885
01:32:58,438 --> 01:32:59,438
No!

1886
01:33:07,982 --> 01:33:09,982
Break it up! Get off!

1887
01:33:09,983 --> 01:33:11,983
Hands behind your back.
Hands behind your back.

1888
01:33:11,984 --> 01:33:14,054
- I'm the good guy here!
- All right.

1889
01:33:15,156 --> 01:33:16,224
Are you okay, Har?

1890
01:33:17,224 --> 01:33:18,693
I think so.

1891
01:33:24,465 --> 01:33:26,410
Oh, yeah, it's just a little graze.

1892
01:33:27,301 --> 01:33:29,669
Uh, Har?

1893
01:33:29,670 --> 01:33:32,115
You might wanna put a
dab of Bactine on that.

1894
01:33:35,676 --> 01:33:37,076
Hurry, he's been shot!

1895
01:33:37,077 --> 01:33:38,178
We need a trauma room.

1896
01:33:38,179 --> 01:33:39,946
You're gonna be okay. What have we got?

1897
01:33:39,947 --> 01:33:42,182
Gunshot wound, left shoulder.

1898
01:33:42,183 --> 01:33:43,482
Lloyd, the kidney!

1899
01:33:43,483 --> 01:33:44,684
Kidney?

1900
01:33:44,685 --> 01:33:45,719
Oh, yeah.

1901
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:48,187
Would you, by any chance,
have time this evening

1902
01:33:48,188 --> 01:33:49,656
to swap out a kidney?

1903
01:33:49,657 --> 01:33:52,058
I'm sorry, sir. What is this?

1904
01:33:52,059 --> 01:33:53,448
It's a kidney. My kidney.

1905
01:33:54,429 --> 01:33:55,429
It's for him,

1906
01:33:56,229 --> 01:33:58,130
- my best pal.
- Ah!

1907
01:33:58,131 --> 01:33:59,131
He needs it.

1908
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:02,638
Gentlemen, this is not a kidney.

1909
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:05,339
What is it?

1910
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:07,076
- Better not be my heart.
- No.

1911
01:34:08,076 --> 01:34:10,677
I believe it's a pork chop.

1912
01:34:10,678 --> 01:34:12,678
In a baggie.

1913
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:16,285
I wondered why my kidney had grill marks.

1914
01:34:17,285 --> 01:34:18,720
And a bone.

1915
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:21,187
Hey, wait.

1916
01:34:21,188 --> 01:34:23,577
Does that mean I still have all my kidneys?

1917
01:34:24,224 --> 01:34:25,260
Let's have a look.

1918
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:27,496
Ah.

1919
01:34:28,496 --> 01:34:30,163
I'm going to say probably not.

1920
01:34:32,032 --> 01:34:33,366
That's it.

1921
01:34:33,367 --> 01:34:36,103
I am gonna give that quack an earful

1922
01:34:36,104 --> 01:34:38,382
at my follow-up appointment next Tuesday.

1923
01:34:39,506 --> 01:34:41,575
I'm sorry, Harry.

1924
01:34:41,576 --> 01:34:43,778
I failed you again!

1925
01:34:45,078 --> 01:34:46,780
It's okay, Lloyd.

1926
01:34:46,781 --> 01:34:48,384
I forgive you.

1927
01:34:52,252 --> 01:34:54,021
What's so funny?

1928
01:34:54,022 --> 01:34:56,189
Got ya!

1929
01:34:57,524 --> 01:34:59,660
I never needed a kidney!

1930
01:35:02,529 --> 01:35:03,563
What?

1931
01:35:03,564 --> 01:35:05,799
Oh,
you should have seen the look on your face!

1932
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:08,469
I got you so good!

1933
01:35:10,071 --> 01:35:11,537
Wait a minute.

1934
01:35:11,538 --> 01:35:13,106
You mean,

1935
01:35:13,107 --> 01:35:16,610
I had my kidney removed

1936
01:35:16,611 --> 01:35:19,478
in the backseat of a Toyota Tercel

1937
01:35:19,479 --> 01:35:22,084
- and you were faking?
- Uh-huh.

1938
01:35:23,084 --> 01:35:24,786
That is awesome!

1939
01:35:27,255 --> 01:35:28,791
That is a good one.

1940
01:35:30,791 --> 01:35:32,228
Totally worth it!

1941
01:35:33,883 --> 01:35:36,495
Gentlemen,
I hate to break up this Mensa summit,

1942
01:35:36,496 --> 01:35:38,130
but we've gotta get this
man's shoulder cleaned out.

1943
01:35:38,131 --> 01:35:39,934
Do you remember, you've been shot?

1944
01:35:40,134 --> 01:35:41,769
That was a good gag, Harry.

1945
01:35:43,450 --> 01:35:46,173
But don't you think it
still would have been funny

1946
01:35:46,174 --> 01:35:49,241
if you had told me you were kidding
before I lost my vital organ?

1947
01:35:49,242 --> 01:35:52,112
Oh, definitely. But not as!

1948
01:35:56,751 --> 01:35:58,797
That's true.

1949
01:36:10,797 --> 01:36:12,799
You guys are so cool.

1950
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:15,268
How can I ever thank you
for what you did for me?

1951
01:36:15,269 --> 01:36:17,103
Got any cash?

1952
01:36:17,104 --> 01:36:18,437
Oh, yeah,

1953
01:36:18,438 --> 01:36:20,173
I think I've got a couple...

1954
01:36:20,174 --> 01:36:21,808
Thanks.

1955
01:36:21,809 --> 01:36:23,278
Score.

1956
01:36:31,719 --> 01:36:33,553
Oh, uh...

1957
01:36:33,554 --> 01:36:36,522
I'm sure those janitors
will thank us later.

1958
01:36:36,523 --> 01:36:38,558
We were just straightening
up their broom closet.

1959
01:36:38,559 --> 01:36:40,494
Penny, wonderful news!

1960
01:36:40,495 --> 01:36:43,662
Your father has invited me to
come stay with you for a while,

1961
01:36:43,663 --> 01:36:45,866
so we can really get to know each other.

1962
01:36:45,867 --> 01:36:48,468
That's fantastic!

1963
01:36:48,469 --> 01:36:50,836
So let me ask you something, Fraida.

1964
01:36:50,837 --> 01:36:53,607
If I'm not Penny's father
and Lloyd's not her father,

1965
01:36:53,608 --> 01:36:55,674
then who's her father?

1966
01:36:55,675 --> 01:36:57,410
Funny you should ask.

1967
01:36:57,411 --> 01:36:58,745
Honey,

1968
01:36:58,746 --> 01:37:01,353
how would you like to meet some relatives?

1969
01:37:05,353 --> 01:37:07,454
Mr. Stainer?

1970
01:37:07,455 --> 01:37:08,921
Oh, I should have known.

1971
01:37:08,922 --> 01:37:11,157
You horny, old goat!

1972
01:37:11,158 --> 01:37:13,527
No, Lloyd!

1973
01:37:13,528 --> 01:37:15,829
Mr. Stainer is Penny's grandfather.

1974
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:17,533
Come on.

1975
01:37:19,533 --> 01:37:22,770
So, you mean Pee-Stain is the dad?

1976
01:37:23,770 --> 01:37:24,770
Duh!

1977
01:37:31,711 --> 01:37:32,711
Hi!

1978
01:37:33,214 --> 01:37:34,248
Oh...

1979
01:37:35,248 --> 01:37:37,450
She's beautiful!

1980
01:37:37,451 --> 01:37:38,953
Sweet Jesus, look at her.

1981
01:37:39,953 --> 01:37:41,655
She's got Peter's eyes.

1982
01:37:41,656 --> 01:37:42,789
You're kidding!

1983
01:37:42,790 --> 01:37:44,459
He donated them?

1984
01:37:45,459 --> 01:37:46,893
Hi, Pee-Stain!

1985
01:37:46,894 --> 01:37:48,794
Stainy!

1986
01:37:48,795 --> 01:37:52,264
Hey, sorry you got killed!

1987
01:37:52,265 --> 01:37:55,268
Let's get you away from these guys, huh?
Let's go.

1988
01:37:55,269 --> 01:37:56,904
Yeah.

1989
01:37:57,904 --> 01:38:01,907
Guys,
there's still one thing I don't understand.

1990
01:38:01,908 --> 01:38:05,711
How could either of you
have possibly thought

1991
01:38:05,712 --> 01:38:08,615
that you were Penny's father?

1992
01:38:08,616 --> 01:38:11,250
- Why wouldn't we?
- Yeah!

1993
01:38:11,251 --> 01:38:12,952
Because we never had sex.

1994
01:38:12,953 --> 01:38:14,322
Oh.

1995
01:38:18,492 --> 01:38:20,360
You could have fooled us.

1996
01:38:20,361 --> 01:38:21,894
Yeah, nice try, Snow White.

1997
01:38:21,895 --> 01:38:24,598
Does the word "hot tub" jog your memory?

1998
01:38:24,599 --> 01:38:25,699
If I recall,

1999
01:38:25,700 --> 01:38:28,300
I played with your boobies
for a long time that night.

2000
01:38:28,301 --> 01:38:30,503
The motor boat,
the windshield wipers,

2001
01:38:30,504 --> 01:38:31,937
the punching bag.

2002
01:38:31,938 --> 01:38:33,240
You know, Harry,

2003
01:38:33,241 --> 01:38:36,276
you can't get a woman pregnant
by man-handling her breasts.

2004
01:38:36,277 --> 01:38:37,677
Oh, really?

2005
01:38:37,678 --> 01:38:40,100
Then why did your doorbells get so hard?

2006
01:38:40,113 --> 01:38:42,115
Yeah. And did you forget
about the French tickler,

2007
01:38:42,116 --> 01:38:43,683
in the back of the van?

2008
01:38:43,684 --> 01:38:47,320
Putting a frilly,
glow-in-the-dark condom on your finger

2009
01:38:47,321 --> 01:38:49,489
is not the same as having sex.

2010
01:38:49,490 --> 01:38:50,990
But what if I go like this?

2011
01:38:52,259 --> 01:38:53,593
No.

2012
01:38:53,594 --> 01:38:56,261
Okay, Dr. Picasso,
what's your definition of sex?

2013
01:39:01,536 --> 01:39:03,402
No way!

2014
01:39:03,403 --> 01:39:05,004
That's just...

2015
01:39:05,005 --> 01:39:06,440
Not my mom!

2016
01:39:06,441 --> 01:39:11,078
- But that's where she pees!
- It's in my head and I can't unlearn it!

2017
01:39:11,079 --> 01:39:12,579
You're bad!

2018
01:39:12,580 --> 01:39:13,746
Can you show us?

2019
01:39:13,747 --> 01:39:15,384
I call sloppy seconds!

2020
01:39:19,519 --> 01:39:22,621
Looks like everyone else
ended up with someone.

2021
01:39:22,622 --> 01:39:24,223
Yep.

2022
01:39:24,224 --> 01:39:25,613
And I got this pork chop.

2023
01:39:27,161 --> 01:39:29,161
So let me get this straight, Har.

2024
01:39:29,162 --> 01:39:31,597
When you visited me in the
nuthouse the last time...

2025
01:39:31,598 --> 01:39:33,400
- Uh-huh.
- ...you knew about Penny already?

2026
01:39:33,401 --> 01:39:35,736
No, I found out about her
when we visited my parents.

2027
01:39:35,737 --> 01:39:38,504
But I had finally figured
out that you were faking.

2028
01:39:38,505 --> 01:39:40,007
- Really? How?
- Mmm-hmm.

2029
01:39:40,008 --> 01:39:41,641
What gave it away?

2030
01:39:41,642 --> 01:39:44,044
A few months ago,
I was changing your diaper before bedtime

2031
01:39:44,045 --> 01:39:46,715
and you just seemed a little too upbeat.

2032
01:39:48,715 --> 01:39:50,417
Lloyd,

2033
01:39:50,418 --> 01:39:53,053
even though it's Christmas Eve,

2034
01:39:53,054 --> 01:39:55,755
I want you to know that there's
no place I would rather be

2035
01:39:55,756 --> 01:39:58,659
than right here,
wiping my best friend's dookie.

2036
01:40:00,594 --> 01:40:01,529
Oh.

2037
01:40:01,530 --> 01:40:04,165
Looks like we got another stocking stuffer.

2038
01:40:08,169 --> 01:40:10,236
I remember that.

2039
01:40:10,237 --> 01:40:12,672
That was the night I had all
that eggnog and lamb, right?

2040
01:40:12,673 --> 01:40:13,673
Yeah. Whoa!

2041
01:40:14,241 --> 01:40:15,241
Lloyd!

2042
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:21,647
Check out the hotties at 12 o'clock.

2043
01:40:21,648 --> 01:40:23,417
That's almost three hours away.

2044
01:40:23,418 --> 01:40:25,253
Can't I check them out now?

2045
01:40:33,728 --> 01:40:34,994
Okay, Lloyd,

2046
01:40:34,995 --> 01:40:38,097
this time we're not gonna be
stupid and pass up a sure thing.

2047
01:40:38,098 --> 01:40:40,534
I hear you, Har.

2048
01:40:40,535 --> 01:40:42,268
We'll never get another chance like this.

2049
01:40:42,269 --> 01:40:44,277
Our time has finally come.

2050
01:40:52,213 --> 01:40:53,481
Bush club!

2051
01:41:15,152 --> 01:41:17,154
Oh, crap!

2052
01:41:17,155 --> 01:41:19,722
I ordered a vanilla shake and
they gave me a chocolate one.

2053
01:41:19,723 --> 01:41:21,758
Tell me about it.
I ordered a chocolate shake.

2054
01:41:21,759 --> 01:41:23,560
Those dopes gave me a vanilla one.

2055
01:41:23,561 --> 01:41:25,564
They do that a lot.

2056
01:41:27,765 --> 01:41:28,768
What the hell?

2057
01:41:30,769 --> 01:41:32,970
Kick his ass, Seabass!

2058
01:41:32,971 --> 01:41:34,694
Arr, the dirty sons-of-bitches!
