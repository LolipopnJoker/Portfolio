00:01:03,116 --> 00:01:04,747
<i>All right,
think good thoughts.</i>

3
00:01:04,749 --> 00:01:07,184
<i>Then on three,
let the good thought go.</i>

4
00:01:07,186 --> 00:01:08,318
Yeah. That's good.

5
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,652
I think
that's pretty, right?

6
00:01:09,654 --> 00:01:11,856
That's gonna be a good luck
charm for us today, right?

7
00:01:11,858 --> 00:01:13,690
Okay, Meg,
important question.

8
00:01:13,692 --> 00:01:15,158
Van Halen or Bono? Bono?

9
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,493
- That one.
- That's what I thought.

10
00:01:16,495 --> 00:01:19,428
That's my girl. Whoo!

11
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,232
Oh, yeah! Stick your
tongue out, come on.

12
00:01:22,234 --> 00:01:24,335
Ah!

13
00:01:24,337 --> 00:01:26,637
You got your frequency,
you got your voltage, okay?

14
00:01:26,639 --> 00:01:28,639
<i>They're like a salt silica, right?
You don't wanna eat it.</i>

15
00:01:28,641 --> 00:01:30,908
- Just go crazy with it.
- Yeah.

16
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,407
...this little gizmo
right here,

17
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:33,744
and we're gonna
choose a frequency.

18
00:01:33,746 --> 00:01:35,146
<i>We're gonna choose
the frequency.</i>

19
00:01:35,148 --> 00:01:36,613
<i>You would intently
watch this plate.</i>

20
00:01:36,615 --> 00:01:38,116
<i>Let's see what happens
to the sand.</i>

21
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:39,583
<i>Because very interesting,
magical things</i>

22
00:01:39,585 --> 00:01:41,085
- <i>will happen to the sand.</i>
- Whoa!

23
00:01:45,758 --> 00:01:47,193
So...

24
00:01:49,327 --> 00:01:51,661
are you ready to meet
your new brother?

25
00:01:51,663 --> 00:01:53,362
Do you think
we'll like each other,

26
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:56,433
like real brothers
and sisters?

27
00:01:56,435 --> 00:01:58,505
I think we'll all
love each other.

28
00:02:00,273 --> 00:02:03,940
Out of this wide,
wide universe...

29
00:02:03,942 --> 00:02:05,911
this huge universe...

30
00:02:06,978 --> 00:02:08,879
with all these brothers

31
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:11,951
and sisters and moms
and dads...

32
00:02:14,254 --> 00:02:15,922
he found us.

33
00:02:16,756 --> 00:02:19,155
And we found each other.

34
00:02:19,157 --> 00:02:20,390
<i>That's pretty rare.</i>

35
00:02:20,392 --> 00:02:21,728
<i>That's pretty cool.</i>

36
00:02:23,195 --> 00:02:25,261
Okay, so...

37
00:02:25,263 --> 00:02:28,601
This is our love.

38
00:02:34,274 --> 00:02:35,640
Don't worry.

39
00:02:35,642 --> 00:02:36,974
It's not gone.

40
00:02:36,976 --> 00:02:39,778
It's just...
It's just enfolded.

41
00:02:40,344 --> 00:02:42,246
Love is always there.

42
00:02:42,248 --> 00:02:44,350
Even if you don't feel it...

43
00:02:46,185 --> 00:02:48,755
it's always there for you.

44
00:03:30,196 --> 00:03:31,731
Not gone...

45
00:03:39,338 --> 00:03:41,007
just enfolded.

46
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:00,660
Hey.

47
00:04:01,093 --> 00:04:02,095
Hi, Meg.

48
00:04:02,828 --> 00:04:04,597
Let's be exclusive.

49
00:04:05,964 --> 00:04:06,929
What?

50
00:04:06,931 --> 00:04:10,432
That's my new word
for the day. Exclusive.

51
00:04:10,434 --> 00:04:11,637
Do you like it?

52
00:04:13,404 --> 00:04:15,171
Love it, Biscuits.

53
00:04:19,377 --> 00:04:21,080
Couldn't sleep either?

54
00:04:22,413 --> 00:04:25,315
Why didn't you just come up
to my room?

55
00:04:25,317 --> 00:04:27,453
'Cause I knew
you'd be down.

56
00:04:32,158 --> 00:04:35,058
Hey. You made sandwiches.

57
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,729
And I'm cooking milk.

58
00:04:37,663 --> 00:04:40,497
This is a lot of milk,
Charles Wallace.

59
00:04:40,499 --> 00:04:42,599
It's good to be prepared.

60
00:04:42,601 --> 00:04:45,137
You never know
who will stop by.

61
00:04:46,337 --> 00:04:47,871
<i>And I'm Michele Norris.</i>

62
00:04:47,873 --> 00:04:50,306
<i>Tomorrow marks
the four-year anniversary...</i>

63
00:04:50,308 --> 00:04:54,510
<i>of the disappearance of NASA scientist Dr.
Alex Murry.</i>

64
00:04:54,512 --> 00:04:55,746
<i>Dr. Murry went missing</i>

65
00:04:55,748 --> 00:04:57,080
<i>just a week
after publicly announcing...</i>

66
00:04:57,082 --> 00:04:58,181
They're talking
about Daddy.

67
00:04:58,183 --> 00:05:00,717
<i>...he could travel
the universe with his mind.</i>

68
00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:03,453
<i>91
billion light-years traveled,</i>

69
00:05:03,455 --> 00:05:04,887
<i>like that.</i>

70
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:07,291
<i>Authorities
note there are still</i>

71
00:05:07,293 --> 00:05:09,459
<i>no leads in the case.</i>

72
00:05:18,771 --> 00:05:20,805
Everybody say,
"Hi, Meg."

73
00:05:20,807 --> 00:05:22,441
Hi, Meg.

74
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,546
Hi, Meg.

75
00:06:10,022 --> 00:06:11,386
I mean, he's been gone

76
00:06:11,388 --> 00:06:12,957
four years to the day.

77
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,991
He's probably just pretending
to be in outer space...

78
00:06:14,993 --> 00:06:17,527
but he's really
hiding out in Tijuana.

79
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:19,495
I bet
it involves another woman.

80
00:06:19,497 --> 00:06:20,830
Either that
or a Martian.

81
00:06:20,832 --> 00:06:23,299
Seriously though,
something so horrible

82
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:24,635
had to have happened
to him.

83
00:06:24,637 --> 00:06:26,036
To leave his kids
like that?

84
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:28,972
And just after they
adopted Charles Wallace.

85
00:06:28,974 --> 00:06:30,306
They seemed so happy.

86
00:06:30,308 --> 00:06:33,743
And Meg used to be so engaged,
and now she is a mess.

87
00:06:33,745 --> 00:06:35,178
But the boy is brilliant.

88
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,748
- Absolutely brilliant. Oh.
- But odd, so odd!

89
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,015
I guess I would be too

90
00:06:39,017 --> 00:06:40,382
if my dad ran away, huh?

91
00:06:40,384 --> 00:06:42,554
Shame on you
for talking like that!

92
00:06:43,388 --> 00:06:44,888
Uh... Oh.
My dear, I'm sorry...

93
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,222
And I'm not odd, you are...

94
00:06:46,224 --> 00:06:48,592
because you think making up
mean stories about people...

95
00:06:48,594 --> 00:06:50,226
makes you feel better
about yourselves.

96
00:06:50,228 --> 00:06:51,794
Well, it doesn't,
does it?

97
00:06:51,796 --> 00:06:54,065
Charles Wallace, we don't
talk to teachers like that!

98
00:06:54,067 --> 00:06:55,132
And Meg might be a mess...

99
00:06:55,134 --> 00:06:56,900
but she has more potential
in her pinky...

100
00:06:56,902 --> 00:06:59,468
than you do
in your whole body!

101
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,805
Did you hear that, Meg? Meg!

102
00:07:01,807 --> 00:07:05,642
Over here. Did you hear that?
Meg! You may be a mess...

103
00:07:05,644 --> 00:07:08,114
but you have more potential
than anybody here!

104
00:07:09,214 --> 00:07:11,013
Oh, no, no, no.

105
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:11,882
Mommy was awkward

106
00:07:11,884 --> 00:07:13,618
and funny-looking
at your age, too!

107
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,921
And look at her now.
She's beautiful!

108
00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:23,596
So, looks like crazy
runs in the family.

109
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:27,901
What did you just say?

110
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:31,137
I see why your dad left.

111
00:07:33,772 --> 00:07:36,173
Who does she even think
that she's talking to?

112
00:07:36,175 --> 00:07:37,674
Hey, Veronica.

113
00:07:52,658 --> 00:07:54,827
You're
next, Charles Wallace.

114
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:04,935
Veronica Kiley's
parents are on their way here.

115
00:08:04,937 --> 00:08:07,536
They're worried for
their daughter's safety.

116
00:08:07,538 --> 00:08:09,575
Their daughter is mean.

117
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,312
You hit her in the face.

118
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:26,755
You...

119
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:28,193
You were a top student.

120
00:08:28,962 --> 00:08:30,794
Top attitude.

121
00:08:30,796 --> 00:08:32,599
But look at you now. You...

122
00:08:33,566 --> 00:08:36,166
You're aggressive,
you're hostile...

123
00:08:36,168 --> 00:08:37,901
you shut everybody out...

124
00:08:37,903 --> 00:08:40,139
and then wonder
why they don't like you.

125
00:08:40,939 --> 00:08:43,675
I don't wonder
and I don't care.

126
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:45,712
Hmm.

127
00:08:46,846 --> 00:08:47,846
Well...

128
00:08:48,713 --> 00:08:51,281
maybe that's your problem.

129
00:08:51,283 --> 00:08:53,850
I don't have a problem.

130
00:08:53,852 --> 00:08:55,886
You can't keep using
your father's disappearance

131
00:08:55,888 --> 00:08:58,522
as an excuse to act out.

132
00:08:58,524 --> 00:09:00,156
What do you think he would say
about all this?

133
00:09:00,158 --> 00:09:03,329
Seriously. If he walked
in that door today...

134
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:05,798
what would happen?

135
00:09:09,567 --> 00:09:12,038
The world would
make sense again.

136
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:19,075
Listen.

137
00:09:19,077 --> 00:09:22,682
All I'm saying is,
it's been four years.

138
00:09:25,349 --> 00:09:29,022
Odds are he's not
coming back.

139
00:09:36,427 --> 00:09:39,262
I did not excuse you,
young lady. Meg.

140
00:09:39,264 --> 00:09:42,034
I want you to write an apology
to Principal Jenkins.

141
00:09:46,505 --> 00:09:48,407
And one to Veronica.

142
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,473
Mom!

143
00:09:51,475 --> 00:09:53,844
She called
Charles Wallace crazy!

144
00:09:53,846 --> 00:09:55,815
That's no excuse.

145
00:10:00,384 --> 00:10:01,551
Well, Dad always told me

146
00:10:01,553 --> 00:10:03,255
to stand up
for what I believe in.

147
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,464
Don't use Dad like that.

148
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:16,101
It's not fair.

149
00:10:22,508 --> 00:10:25,278
He's not coming back,
is he?

150
00:10:33,686 --> 00:10:36,417
Don't give up hope, Meglet.

151
00:10:39,356 --> 00:10:42,358
I knew
it was you! Come on in.

152
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,862
Wow! Talk about
a dark and stormy night.

153
00:10:45,864 --> 00:10:48,764
Are those
Mrs. Buncombe's sheets?

154
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:49,968
Maybe.

155
00:10:55,774 --> 00:10:56,940
Excuse me.

156
00:10:56,942 --> 00:10:59,642
Oh, aren't you dazzling!
You must be Dr. Murry.

157
00:10:59,644 --> 00:11:01,076
Yes. And...

158
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,946
Your house is so warm.

159
00:11:02,948 --> 00:11:05,117
You've done a wonderful job
keeping the darkness out.

160
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,251
Mom. Mom!

161
00:11:08,253 --> 00:11:10,552
Do you want me to call 911?

162
00:11:10,554 --> 00:11:12,522
Well, almost all the darkness.

163
00:11:12,524 --> 00:11:14,758
You must be Meg.

164
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,626
How... How do you
know my name?

165
00:11:16,628 --> 00:11:17,795
Because I told her.

166
00:11:17,797 --> 00:11:19,762
Guys, calm down.

167
00:11:19,764 --> 00:11:22,135
Don't worry.
She's my friend.

168
00:11:23,001 --> 00:11:24,936
Call me Mrs. Whatsit.

169
00:11:25,837 --> 00:11:27,368
Mrs. Who?

170
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:28,806
No, Mrs. Whatsit.

171
00:11:28,808 --> 00:11:30,306
Mrs. Who is...

172
00:11:30,308 --> 00:11:31,775
She's, like,
a billion years older

173
00:11:31,777 --> 00:11:33,743
and way more
knowledgeable.

174
00:11:33,745 --> 00:11:37,748
What can I do for you,
Mrs. Whatsit?

175
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,348
I caught her stealing sheets.

176
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,383
Guys, she's harmless.

177
00:11:41,385 --> 00:11:43,753
You're six. Come on.

178
00:11:43,755 --> 00:11:45,155
What do you know
about harmless?

179
00:11:45,157 --> 00:11:46,989
Have I ever been wrong?

180
00:11:46,991 --> 00:11:49,292
One of these days, you
might be, Charles Wallace.

181
00:11:49,294 --> 00:11:50,492
Oh, I highly doubt that.

182
00:11:50,494 --> 00:11:52,932
He's one of the greatest minds
in recent history.

183
00:11:53,498 --> 00:11:55,131
He's prodigious.

184
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:58,768
But of course, we can't take
any credit for our talents.

185
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:01,274
It's how we use them
that counts.

186
00:12:03,741 --> 00:12:06,142
Okay, then.
The thing is...

187
00:12:06,144 --> 00:12:09,845
we don't know you,
and it's late, so...

188
00:12:09,847 --> 00:12:13,216
Oh, is it?
I'm terrible with time.

189
00:12:13,218 --> 00:12:15,419
Mrs. Which
usually handles that.

190
00:12:15,953 --> 00:12:17,686
Uh... Right.

191
00:12:17,688 --> 00:12:18,955
Um...

192
00:12:18,957 --> 00:12:20,723
The thing is, uh...

193
00:12:20,725 --> 00:12:23,826
the kids need
to get to bed...

194
00:12:23,828 --> 00:12:26,531
so if you don't mind
visiting some other time.

195
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:30,101
Oh, of course I will.

196
00:12:31,102 --> 00:12:34,106
I just wanna tell you
one thing before I go.

197
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:45,315
I want you to know
that no matter what happens...

198
00:12:45,317 --> 00:12:49,221
you and your husband achieved
something truly extraordinary.

199
00:12:50,455 --> 00:12:52,623
What are you
talking about?

200
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,123
Just that there really is

201
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:57,129
such a thing
as a tesseract.

202
00:12:58,197 --> 00:12:59,264
What?

203
00:13:03,668 --> 00:13:05,768
A tesseract?

204
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,970
That's what I said.
Tesseract.

205
00:13:07,972 --> 00:13:10,708
Is... Is this
some kind of joke?

206
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,941
Did Veronica
put you up to this?

207
00:13:12,943 --> 00:13:15,646
You really don't
trust easily, do you?

208
00:13:15,648 --> 00:13:17,214
Hmm.

209
00:13:17,216 --> 00:13:19,581
Charles Wallace,
I'm not sure about Meg.

210
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,186
Give her a chance.

211
00:13:21,687 --> 00:13:22,985
Okay.

212
00:13:22,987 --> 00:13:24,921
You're the boss.

213
00:13:24,923 --> 00:13:26,659
I better run.

214
00:13:28,827 --> 00:13:32,530
Ah! Wild nights are my glory.

215
00:13:52,116 --> 00:13:53,751
Never do that again.

216
00:13:53,753 --> 00:13:57,153
Never let anyone in the house
without our permission.

217
00:13:57,155 --> 00:14:01,291
And please stop talking
to strangers.

218
00:14:01,293 --> 00:14:03,391
I don't
talk to them, they talk to me.

219
00:14:03,393 --> 00:14:05,195
Doesn't mean
you have to answer.

220
00:14:05,197 --> 00:14:07,596
Now,
that's just bad manners, Meg.

221
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:09,532
Charles Wallace.

222
00:14:09,534 --> 00:14:10,700
Hey, buddy!

223
00:14:10,702 --> 00:14:11,901
How's it going?

224
00:14:11,903 --> 00:14:13,338
I'm cool.

225
00:14:14,072 --> 00:14:15,607
Hello, princess.

226
00:14:17,909 --> 00:14:19,776
See?
Told ya.

227
00:14:19,778 --> 00:14:21,681
Yeah, be yourself.

228
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:27,083
Don't be like me.

229
00:14:27,085 --> 00:14:28,988
What's wrong
with being like you?

230
00:14:30,588 --> 00:14:32,190
You have a pretty good arm.

231
00:14:33,658 --> 00:14:34,693
Veronica.

232
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:36,662
Direct hit.

233
00:14:39,397 --> 00:14:41,430
Hi. I'm Charles Wallace,
Meg's brother.

234
00:14:41,432 --> 00:14:43,501
- You're Calvin, aren't you?
- That I am.

235
00:14:44,903 --> 00:14:46,639
What are you doing here?

236
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:48,975
I don't know.

237
00:14:49,774 --> 00:14:51,641
I was doing my homework...

238
00:14:51,643 --> 00:14:52,843
and suddenly
I got this feeling

239
00:14:52,845 --> 00:14:54,146
that I had to come here.

240
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,680
Like, right here.

241
00:14:56,682 --> 00:14:57,716
Is that weird?

242
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,749
Maybe a little.

243
00:15:00,751 --> 00:15:03,853
The truth is,
you were called here.

244
00:15:03,855 --> 00:15:06,189
You're good at diplomacy.

245
00:15:06,191 --> 00:15:08,624
What do we need diplomacy for,
Charles Wallace?

246
00:15:08,626 --> 00:15:12,228
Well, the fact that you asked
is exactly why we need it.

247
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,332
So what do you say, Calvin,
you wanna come with us?

248
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:18,269
Sure.

249
00:15:18,636 --> 00:15:19,771
Why not?

250
00:15:21,239 --> 00:15:22,605
Great.

251
00:15:22,607 --> 00:15:24,542
Let's go meet Mrs. Who.

252
00:15:25,177 --> 00:15:27,476
No! No, Charles Wallace!

253
00:15:27,478 --> 00:15:29,546
Charles Wallace,
do not go in there.

254
00:15:29,548 --> 00:15:32,415
That house is falling apart,
it's off-limits.

255
00:15:32,417 --> 00:15:34,651
He's a fearless
little guy.

256
00:15:34,653 --> 00:15:36,589
Unfortunately.

257
00:15:38,657 --> 00:15:40,223
I told you no.

258
00:15:40,225 --> 00:15:42,926
We cannot go in there.
It's not safe.

259
00:15:42,928 --> 00:15:45,896
It's practically
the safest place...

260
00:15:45,898 --> 00:15:47,696
in the universe.

261
00:15:52,436 --> 00:15:53,606
Look.

262
00:16:09,822 --> 00:16:11,653
Mrs. Who, it's me,
Charles Wallace.

263
00:16:11,655 --> 00:16:13,659
Oh.

264
00:16:32,778 --> 00:16:34,543
"Life without love...

265
00:16:34,545 --> 00:16:37,549
"is like a tree
without blossoms or fruit."

266
00:16:38,516 --> 00:16:41,087
Gibran, Lebanese.

267
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,756
Calvin. Uh, American.

268
00:16:45,758 --> 00:16:46,889
Mrs. Who prefers

269
00:16:46,891 --> 00:16:48,457
not to think for herself.

270
00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:51,328
That's just rude,
Charles Wallace.

271
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:54,062
No. She's just evolved
past language...

272
00:16:54,064 --> 00:16:55,764
so when
she needs to think...

273
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:58,935
she cheats and uses
other people's words.

274
00:16:58,937 --> 00:17:00,970
It's nice how
she gives them credit.

275
00:17:00,972 --> 00:17:04,143
Mrs. Who, meet my Meg.

276
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:09,581
Okay.

277
00:17:10,715 --> 00:17:11,750
Okay.

278
00:17:15,486 --> 00:17:19,625
"The wound is the place where
the light enters you."

279
00:17:21,827 --> 00:17:24,429
Rumi, Persian.

280
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:34,938
Poor Mrs. Who.

281
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,337
We tired her out.

282
00:17:36,339 --> 00:17:38,475
I guess she was
really tired.

283
00:17:39,577 --> 00:17:41,309
She's still adjusting.

284
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:43,314
Adjusting to what?

285
00:17:44,215 --> 00:17:46,083
Sorry, you're almost,

286
00:17:46,085 --> 00:17:48,050
but not quite ready
to find out.

287
00:17:48,052 --> 00:17:49,450
Charles Wallace...

288
00:17:49,452 --> 00:17:52,523
whatever she is, whatever that
is, whatever all this is...

289
00:17:52,525 --> 00:17:53,757
I don't like it.

290
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:54,827
You'll manage.

291
00:17:56,426 --> 00:17:59,264
Come on, time to go.
Let's let Mrs. Who rest.

292
00:18:00,131 --> 00:18:02,535
We'll see her again
very soon.

293
00:18:07,204 --> 00:18:08,370
Charles Wallace,
can you, um,

294
00:18:08,372 --> 00:18:09,775
pass me the pepper, please?

295
00:18:10,575 --> 00:18:12,040
Thank you.

296
00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:13,409
So, they met in college.

297
00:18:13,411 --> 00:18:15,077
She was tutoring him.

298
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:17,046
It's a great story,
actually.

299
00:18:17,048 --> 00:18:18,449
Oh, really?

300
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,586
Is that his work?

301
00:18:22,987 --> 00:18:24,787
Mommy's, too.

302
00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:25,790
Cool.

303
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,193
What's it about?

304
00:18:33,897 --> 00:18:35,233
Well...

305
00:18:36,335 --> 00:18:39,270
I'm mostly interested
in the small...

306
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:42,805
atoms, particles...

307
00:18:42,807 --> 00:18:47,210
<i>the unseeable energies
that move through us all.</i>

308
00:18:47,212 --> 00:18:48,979
Go get 'em.

309
00:18:48,981 --> 00:18:52,346
<i>Their dad
is all about the big.</i>

310
00:18:57,588 --> 00:19:02,225
<i>So, what if
we are here for a reason?</i>

311
00:19:02,227 --> 00:19:04,493
What if we are not just
in the universe...

312
00:19:04,495 --> 00:19:08,597
but the universe
is within all of us?

313
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:10,799
Think about
quantum entanglement.

314
00:19:10,801 --> 00:19:13,835
Two electrons
once bonded together,

315
00:19:13,837 --> 00:19:15,204
in love, if you will...

316
00:19:15,206 --> 00:19:17,306
suddenly separated
by a galaxy...

317
00:19:17,308 --> 00:19:20,177
but somehow
still just as connected.

318
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:24,079
An unbroken union
despite being galaxies apart.

319
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:26,115
And our most
recent calculations show us

320
00:19:26,117 --> 00:19:28,750
that these fields
connect us...

321
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:30,786
to other dimensions.

322
00:19:30,788 --> 00:19:33,056
Dimensions outside
of the limitations

323
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:34,324
of space and time.

324
00:19:34,326 --> 00:19:36,191
Imagine that. Imagine...

325
00:19:36,193 --> 00:19:38,127
rather than enduring
the oppressive rules

326
00:19:38,129 --> 00:19:41,296
of time and space,
we could wrinkle it.

327
00:19:41,298 --> 00:19:45,768
91 billion light-years
traveled, like that.

328
00:19:47,739 --> 00:19:49,306
And we don't need rockets.

329
00:19:49,308 --> 00:19:51,040
We don't need spaceships.
We don't need anything.

330
00:19:51,042 --> 00:19:53,342
To utilize a tesseract...

331
00:19:53,344 --> 00:19:57,947
all you need is to tap into
the right frequency.

332
00:19:57,949 --> 00:20:00,249
You just need your mind.

333
00:20:09,426 --> 00:20:12,428
He wanted
to touch the stars...

334
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:14,831
unlock the secrets
of the universe...

335
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,635
Find its origin and...

336
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:19,804
shake its hand.

337
00:20:22,406 --> 00:20:24,340
You messed up.

338
00:20:24,342 --> 00:20:25,540
You were impatient.

339
00:20:25,542 --> 00:20:27,242
You couldn't follow the plan.

340
00:20:27,244 --> 00:20:28,678
Couldn't you see it
in their eyes?

341
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,212
It was written
all over their faces.

342
00:20:30,214 --> 00:20:31,847
They weren't ready.

343
00:20:31,849 --> 00:20:33,016
They're not...

344
00:20:33,018 --> 00:20:35,585
Kate, they're not ready,
so what are we supposed to do?

345
00:20:35,587 --> 00:20:37,754
We're supposed to wait
until they catch up with us?

346
00:20:37,756 --> 00:20:41,289
We are on the precipice
of something spectacular!

347
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,893
Listen, listen, listen.
Look. Hear me out.

348
00:20:43,895 --> 00:20:46,829
So, in order to be great...

349
00:20:46,831 --> 00:20:49,565
it isn't enough
just to be right.

350
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:52,904
You have to actually
be great.

351
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,674
And we are.

352
00:20:57,842 --> 00:21:01,242
So, why can't we help
the others along?

353
00:21:03,181 --> 00:21:04,382
Yes.

354
00:21:08,586 --> 00:21:11,321
Or we could just
beat them up.

355
00:21:11,323 --> 00:21:12,755
Let's beat them up.

356
00:21:12,757 --> 00:21:14,488
Honestly, it'd be
so much fun.

357
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:17,727
Come here. Come here.

358
00:21:17,729 --> 00:21:19,495
Oh, God.

359
00:21:19,497 --> 00:21:22,397
I almost lost you.
I got so scared.

360
00:21:22,399 --> 00:21:24,402
You crazy,
brilliant scientist.

361
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:36,914
You know,
you have great hair.

362
00:21:39,317 --> 00:21:40,551
What?

363
00:21:41,019 --> 00:21:42,585
No, I don't.

364
00:21:42,587 --> 00:21:43,955
Please don't say that.

365
00:21:44,823 --> 00:21:45,824
Okay.

366
00:21:49,994 --> 00:21:51,763
I had a great time.

367
00:21:54,531 --> 00:21:58,736
Your mom is insanely nice.

368
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:02,271
Your house is warm.

369
00:22:02,273 --> 00:22:04,039
It smells good.

370
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:05,778
And it's full of...

371
00:22:08,345 --> 00:22:09,548
I don't know what.

372
00:22:10,346 --> 00:22:11,884
But it's amazing.

373
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,756
It's far from amazing.

374
00:22:19,758 --> 00:22:23,125
My mom's upstairs in her room
preparing for yet another...

375
00:22:23,127 --> 00:22:26,999
parent-teacher conference
for her delinquent daughter.

376
00:22:33,872 --> 00:22:35,203
Oh, no. Not now.

377
00:22:35,205 --> 00:22:36,271
Come here.

378
00:22:39,343 --> 00:22:41,442
- Veronica's your neighbor?
- Yes.

379
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:43,378
Come here, please.

380
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,584
So you're embarrassed
to be seen with me?

381
00:22:47,218 --> 00:22:48,587
Yeah, right.

382
00:22:49,153 --> 00:22:50,252
Other way around.

383
00:22:50,254 --> 00:22:52,622
She's gonna tell everybody
that you were here with me.

384
00:22:52,624 --> 00:22:55,057
And I'm just trying
to protect your reputation...

385
00:22:55,059 --> 00:22:56,960
so can you come here?

386
00:22:56,962 --> 00:22:59,594
She already saw us,
besides...

387
00:22:59,596 --> 00:23:01,532
there's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

388
00:23:03,234 --> 00:23:04,867
You say that now...

389
00:23:04,869 --> 00:23:07,670
but you don't know
what it's like

390
00:23:07,672 --> 00:23:09,671
having every move
you make...

391
00:23:09,673 --> 00:23:12,144
mocked and ridiculed.

392
00:23:13,443 --> 00:23:15,580
You'd be surprised.

393
00:23:16,647 --> 00:23:18,247
Come on, Calvin.

394
00:23:18,249 --> 00:23:19,649
Everybody likes you.

395
00:23:19,651 --> 00:23:21,887
Even the teachers.

396
00:23:23,288 --> 00:23:25,154
You do everything perfectly.

397
00:23:25,156 --> 00:23:27,625
Tell that
to my dad.

398
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,895
At least
you have your dad.

399
00:23:31,628 --> 00:23:33,898
Right.
Sorry, that...

400
00:23:34,766 --> 00:23:37,102
You must
really miss him.

401
00:23:39,403 --> 00:23:42,604
More than anything
in the universe.

402
00:23:42,606 --> 00:23:44,742
Then how about
we go and find him?

403
00:23:48,113 --> 00:23:50,011
I've never understood
the point of fences.

404
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:51,980
Wait.
What are you doing here?

405
00:23:55,418 --> 00:23:59,122
This is it, kids!
This is it!

406
00:23:59,124 --> 00:24:01,692
No! Hey, no! You're
supposed to be upstairs!

407
00:24:03,894 --> 00:24:06,027
"You need to get up,
get out, and get something.

408
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:08,430
"How will you make it
if you never even try?"

409
00:24:08,432 --> 00:24:09,635
I know that one.

410
00:24:10,268 --> 00:24:12,170
Outkast, American.

411
00:24:12,936 --> 00:24:14,468
How's it going,
Mrs. Who?

412
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:17,139
I did it, Mrs. Who.
I got them ready.

413
00:24:17,141 --> 00:24:20,677
And not a moment
too soon, my little warrior.

414
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:22,410
- What was that?
- Who said that?

415
00:24:22,412 --> 00:24:23,645
Not Who.

416
00:24:23,647 --> 00:24:25,948
Which. Mrs. Which.

417
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:28,220
She's the final piece
of the puzzle.

418
00:24:39,897 --> 00:24:41,699
Come on, Mrs. Which,
show yourself.

419
00:24:44,269 --> 00:24:45,703
How's this?

420
00:24:47,172 --> 00:24:48,839
Is this good?

421
00:24:52,077 --> 00:24:54,145
Great. Perfect.

422
00:24:54,846 --> 00:24:55,844
Wonderful!

423
00:24:55,846 --> 00:24:58,046
You're the wrong size,
Mrs. Which.

424
00:24:58,048 --> 00:25:01,250
Is there such thing
as the wrong size?

425
00:25:01,252 --> 00:25:02,619
No, no. Never.

426
00:25:02,621 --> 00:25:04,451
And... And might I say
how honored I am

427
00:25:04,453 --> 00:25:07,090
to be on this,
my very first mission.

428
00:25:07,092 --> 00:25:09,225
I was chosen
for my great verbalizing

429
00:25:09,227 --> 00:25:10,796
and materializing skills.

430
00:25:12,129 --> 00:25:14,296
What are you?

431
00:25:14,298 --> 00:25:17,200
I am a part of the universe.

432
00:25:17,202 --> 00:25:18,269
Just like you, Meg.

433
00:25:19,403 --> 00:25:20,969
What... What do you
want with us?

434
00:25:20,971 --> 00:25:23,306
I don't know
about her, Charles Wallace.

435
00:25:23,308 --> 00:25:27,045
But I have a very good vibe
from this Calvin kid.

436
00:25:27,746 --> 00:25:30,015
Let's focus, shall we?

437
00:25:31,348 --> 00:25:35,050
We heard a call,
out in the universe.

438
00:25:35,052 --> 00:25:36,187
A human call.

439
00:25:36,989 --> 00:25:38,888
A desperate one.

440
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:40,957
We couldn't tell
where it was coming from...

441
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:44,730
so we followed it here,
to its destination.

442
00:25:47,265 --> 00:25:51,236
It brought them here, Meg.
To our house.

443
00:25:53,437 --> 00:25:55,406
The call
must have been Daddy's.

444
00:25:59,442 --> 00:26:01,378
My father's alive?

445
00:26:03,047 --> 00:26:04,913
We believe he is.

446
00:26:04,915 --> 00:26:07,382
Your father has done
an extraordinary thing.

447
00:26:07,384 --> 00:26:12,188
No human has ever traveled
so far out in the universe.

448
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:13,892
But he may be in danger.

449
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,295
And we're here
to help you find him.

450
00:26:19,698 --> 00:26:22,100
Why would you
wanna do that?

451
00:26:22,933 --> 00:26:24,402
Because that's what we do.

452
00:26:25,269 --> 00:26:26,435
We're warriors who serve

453
00:26:26,437 --> 00:26:28,671
the good and light
in the universe.

454
00:26:28,673 --> 00:26:31,774
Sometimes we rescue,
sometimes we guide.

455
00:26:31,776 --> 00:26:33,542
Think of us
as big-hearted.

456
00:26:33,544 --> 00:26:34,911
Indeed.

457
00:26:34,913 --> 00:26:38,683
Listen, Meg. We must find him
as soon as we can.

458
00:26:40,652 --> 00:26:42,788
Are you up for it?

459
00:26:48,893 --> 00:26:50,660
I bet she says no.

460
00:26:50,662 --> 00:26:51,960
What?

461
00:26:51,962 --> 00:26:53,095
Hmm?

462
00:26:53,097 --> 00:26:54,229
No.

463
00:26:54,231 --> 00:26:55,131
Hmm. No.

464
00:26:55,133 --> 00:26:57,803
No, yes. No.
Yes, I'm going.

465
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:00,072
Of course, I am.

466
00:27:00,704 --> 00:27:02,204
And we know I'm up for it.

467
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:04,308
And Calvin already said
he'd come.

468
00:27:04,975 --> 00:27:06,077
I did?

469
00:27:06,944 --> 00:27:08,077
I did.

470
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:09,511
Then let's go!

471
00:27:09,513 --> 00:27:11,314
Mom. Wait.
We gotta get Mom.

472
00:27:11,316 --> 00:27:13,815
We'll get
your mother later. I promise.

473
00:27:13,817 --> 00:27:15,218
Don't worry, Meg.

474
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:18,890
Tessering is almost nearly
perfectly natural.

475
00:27:19,489 --> 00:27:20,590
Tessering?

476
00:27:20,592 --> 00:27:21,860
"Almost"?

477
00:27:24,428 --> 00:27:25,795
What's happening?

478
00:27:25,797 --> 00:27:29,132
Wait. No, no. Charles Wallace,
don't go over there.

479
00:27:29,134 --> 00:27:31,334
No time to waste, Meg.

480
00:27:31,336 --> 00:27:33,137
Come on, Mrs. Whatsit!

481
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:43,144
You just have
to find the right frequency...

482
00:27:43,146 --> 00:27:45,248
and have faith
in who you are.

483
00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:04,434
Let's find your father.

484
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:06,937
Shall we?

485
00:28:10,374 --> 00:28:11,843
Tessering.

486
00:28:13,477 --> 00:28:14,478
Tessering.

487
00:28:37,702 --> 00:28:39,668
Is this really happening?

488
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:43,108
We did it, Meg. We actually,
really, very much so tessered!

489
00:28:44,341 --> 00:28:47,142
Why does my whole body hurt?

490
00:28:47,144 --> 00:28:49,311
We were in your backyard
and now...

491
00:28:52,683 --> 00:28:53,982
It's real.

492
00:28:53,984 --> 00:28:56,518
Let's make sure
she's all right.

493
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,321
Ow!

494
00:28:58,323 --> 00:28:59,453
Yes, she's fine.

495
00:28:59,455 --> 00:29:02,658
Whatsit,
we don't kick people.

496
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,529
Oh, I didn't know.

497
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:11,601
"The foot feels the foot
when it feels the ground."

498
00:29:11,603 --> 00:29:13,839
Buddha, Nepali.

499
00:29:36,894 --> 00:29:38,629
New word for the day.

500
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,864
Luminous.

501
00:29:41,866 --> 00:29:46,669
This is my favorite planet
in the entire galaxy.

502
00:29:46,671 --> 00:29:48,202
They call it Uriel.

503
00:29:48,204 --> 00:29:50,940
We think your father
tessered here.

504
00:29:50,942 --> 00:29:52,575
Don't be shy.

505
00:29:52,577 --> 00:29:53,776
Go ahead, look around.

506
00:29:53,778 --> 00:29:54,977
Yes!

507
00:30:13,198 --> 00:30:15,267
Come on, Meg.

508
00:30:16,567 --> 00:30:18,502
Go ahead.

509
00:30:37,788 --> 00:30:39,453
Whoa.

510
00:30:39,455 --> 00:30:41,422
You should talk to them.

511
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:44,459
Everyone knows that flowers
are the best gossipers

512
00:30:44,461 --> 00:30:46,528
in the entire universe.

513
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,296
You should show them
a picture of your father

514
00:30:48,298 --> 00:30:50,833
and ask them
if they've seen him.

515
00:30:50,835 --> 00:30:53,939
How are we gonna
understand each other?

516
00:30:57,275 --> 00:30:59,144
At least try.

517
00:31:00,677 --> 00:31:04,011
Seriously, Charles Wallace,
I'm underwhelmed.

518
00:31:04,013 --> 00:31:05,980
Keep the faith, Mrs. Whatsit.

519
00:31:05,982 --> 00:31:07,349
See, I told you
this was too hard for her.

520
00:31:07,351 --> 00:31:09,684
I don't know why we brought
her in the first place.

521
00:31:09,686 --> 00:31:12,523
Whatsit, she can hear you.

522
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:15,526
Oh.

523
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:16,992
Oh, man.

524
00:31:16,994 --> 00:31:19,964
Let's just concentrate
on finding her father.

525
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:40,150
This is our father.

526
00:31:42,486 --> 00:31:45,990
Can you help us
find him, please?

527
00:31:46,824 --> 00:31:48,125
Please.

528
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,702
I can't tell
what they're saying.

529
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,670
I can.

530
00:32:01,672 --> 00:32:03,308
They speak color.

531
00:32:03,907 --> 00:32:05,475
Oh, he did?

532
00:32:05,943 --> 00:32:08,279
Really?

533
00:32:08,779 --> 00:32:11,246
Oh. You don't say.

534
00:32:13,116 --> 00:32:16,585
Yep! He was here!
They saw him tesser here.

535
00:32:16,587 --> 00:32:20,189
But he continued to explore,
they say.

536
00:32:20,191 --> 00:32:21,757
Somewhere in that direction.

537
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:22,891
Let's go!

538
00:32:22,893 --> 00:32:24,162
I'll get changed.

539
00:32:24,729 --> 00:32:25,894
Changed?

540
00:32:25,896 --> 00:32:27,962
Do you, uh,
need some privacy?

541
00:32:27,964 --> 00:32:29,567
No, this is fine.

542
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:46,383
Whoa, Mrs. Whatsit,
humans don't just get naked.

543
00:32:47,351 --> 00:32:50,321
Patience, sir.
I'm not finished yet.

544
00:33:18,749 --> 00:33:20,615
"Dang."

545
00:33:20,617 --> 00:33:21,983
Tucker, American.

546
00:33:34,198 --> 00:33:35,767
Whoa.

547
00:33:55,686 --> 00:33:56,687
No!

548
00:34:02,392 --> 00:34:03,427
Wow!

549
00:34:54,744 --> 00:34:57,880
This is wild!

550
00:34:57,882 --> 00:34:59,184
Whoo!

551
00:35:03,087 --> 00:35:04,956
One, two, three.

552
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:07,688
Whoa!

553
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,293
I'm flying!

554
00:35:18,635 --> 00:35:20,871
Put your arms out!

555
00:35:22,306 --> 00:35:25,339
How are we actually
flying right now?

556
00:35:25,341 --> 00:35:26,608
Well, it's a phenomenon

557
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:29,945
associated with
continuum fluid mechanics.

558
00:35:29,947 --> 00:35:32,584
It's called lift!

559
00:35:42,759 --> 00:35:44,228
What is that?

560
00:35:49,601 --> 00:35:50,602
Whoa!

561
00:35:55,105 --> 00:35:56,840
Calvin!

562
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,249
My friends of light,

563
00:36:07,251 --> 00:36:09,083
please assist
our young friend.

564
00:36:58,201 --> 00:36:59,403
I'm all right.

565
00:37:01,137 --> 00:37:02,539
- Calvin!
- I'm sorry.

566
00:37:04,641 --> 00:37:05,676
I'm okay.

567
00:37:07,545 --> 00:37:09,177
Whatsit,
those from Earth

568
00:37:09,179 --> 00:37:10,780
need more help than most.

569
00:37:10,782 --> 00:37:11,783
You know this...

570
00:37:13,117 --> 00:37:14,816
You could have
prepared them better.

571
00:37:14,818 --> 00:37:17,251
We must help them
stay focused on light

572
00:37:17,253 --> 00:37:18,753
when darkness is present.

573
00:37:18,755 --> 00:37:20,420
I mean, I'm trying.

574
00:37:20,422 --> 00:37:24,193
But they're human.
They're very limited.

575
00:37:24,195 --> 00:37:25,393
Well, tell me you at least

576
00:37:25,395 --> 00:37:27,262
found something up there.

577
00:37:27,264 --> 00:37:28,931
Unfortunately, no.

578
00:37:28,933 --> 00:37:30,431
Their father's moved on.

579
00:37:30,433 --> 00:37:33,001
And that thing
got in our way.

580
00:37:33,003 --> 00:37:35,036
It's spreading fast,
Mrs. Which.

581
00:37:35,038 --> 00:37:36,840
What is that thing?

582
00:37:38,473 --> 00:37:40,943
It's called Camazotz.

583
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:46,113
Home to a purely evil energy.

584
00:37:46,115 --> 00:37:50,121
Known simply as The IT.

585
00:37:50,688 --> 00:37:51,856
Evil?

586
00:37:53,724 --> 00:37:56,624
But, like,
what kind of evil?

587
00:37:56,626 --> 00:37:57,726
How many kinds of evil

588
00:37:57,728 --> 00:37:59,168
- do you need?
- Whatsit.

589
00:38:00,764 --> 00:38:02,329
Okay.

590
00:38:02,331 --> 00:38:04,233
An evil
that's actively spreading

591
00:38:04,235 --> 00:38:05,603
throughout the universe.

592
00:38:06,401 --> 00:38:07,735
So, as we continue on...

593
00:38:07,737 --> 00:38:10,539
we must avoid it
at all costs...

594
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:13,373
and focus
on finding your father.

595
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:15,846
But we don't know
where he's gone.

596
00:38:16,479 --> 00:38:17,912
What do we do?

597
00:38:17,914 --> 00:38:21,686
"Love looks not with the
eyes but with the mind."

598
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:24,154
Shakespeare, British.

599
00:38:24,922 --> 00:38:26,954
Oh, yes, a seer!

600
00:38:26,956 --> 00:38:28,791
We should go visit
one of the seers.

601
00:38:28,793 --> 00:38:30,525
They'll narrow
the search for us.

602
00:38:30,527 --> 00:38:32,059
What's a seer?

603
00:38:32,061 --> 00:38:33,460
A moderate visionary.

604
00:38:33,462 --> 00:38:36,464
An occasional motivator
of insight. Hit or miss.

605
00:38:36,466 --> 00:38:38,166
But I know
a very cute one.

606
00:38:38,168 --> 00:38:39,703
I mean a good one.

607
00:38:41,505 --> 00:38:43,708
That sounds
sort of promising.

608
00:38:45,009 --> 00:38:48,077
Misses, grab a child.

609
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,177
Our journey continues.

610
00:39:28,885 --> 00:39:30,952
She's intact.

611
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:32,287
She's fine.

612
00:39:32,289 --> 00:39:36,023
Fine? After that
beautiful tesser?

613
00:39:36,025 --> 00:39:37,291
She should be glorious.

614
00:39:37,293 --> 00:39:38,726
Everyone else is glorious.

615
00:39:38,728 --> 00:39:41,195
She makes
absolutely no sense.

616
00:39:41,197 --> 00:39:44,032
I absolutely do not understand
that girl whatsoever.

617
00:39:44,034 --> 00:39:45,501
Okay, it's over here.

618
00:39:45,503 --> 00:39:47,368
Wait till you see it.
It's so cool.

619
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,905
The seer lives here?

620
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:55,610
Wow. You're our size.

621
00:39:55,612 --> 00:39:56,814
The three of you...

622
00:39:57,949 --> 00:39:59,784
are beautiful.

623
00:40:00,348 --> 00:40:01,983
Thank you.

624
00:40:01,985 --> 00:40:03,654
And so are you.

625
00:40:10,092 --> 00:40:11,596
Where are we?

626
00:40:11,962 --> 00:40:13,460
Orion.

627
00:40:13,462 --> 00:40:16,167
Home of the Happy Medium.

628
00:40:18,168 --> 00:40:20,501
So this guy
is your boyfriend?

629
00:40:20,503 --> 00:40:21,903
Well, when you're

630
00:40:21,905 --> 00:40:24,437
over a billion years old,
you don't really need labels.

631
00:40:24,439 --> 00:40:27,309
Why do I have to
be in pain?

632
00:40:27,311 --> 00:40:29,377
- Instead of...
- Glorious?

633
00:40:31,282 --> 00:40:33,882
You don't tesser well.

634
00:40:33,884 --> 00:40:35,217
In what way?

635
00:40:35,219 --> 00:40:39,554
Because I don't feel or see
anything when we tesser.

636
00:40:39,556 --> 00:40:42,657
And you won't
until you become...

637
00:40:42,659 --> 00:40:46,195
one with the universe
and yourself.

638
00:40:46,197 --> 00:40:47,929
As it is, it seems like...

639
00:40:47,931 --> 00:40:51,568
you don't even want
to return as yourself.

640
00:40:51,969 --> 00:40:53,433
Oh...

641
00:40:53,435 --> 00:40:57,107
Is there any way
I can return as somebody else?

642
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,976
That I might like?

643
00:41:05,748 --> 00:41:07,250
Do you realize...

644
00:41:09,018 --> 00:41:13,223
how many events
and choices...

645
00:41:14,592 --> 00:41:18,863
that had to occur since
the birth of the universe...

646
00:41:19,596 --> 00:41:24,936
leading to
the making of you...

647
00:41:25,768 --> 00:41:30,808
just exactly
the way you are?

648
00:41:37,748 --> 00:41:40,952
I guess I never really
thought about that.

649
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:44,686
Maybe now's the time

650
00:41:44,688 --> 00:41:46,588
to start thinking about it.

651
00:41:48,659 --> 00:41:50,124
We are here!

652
00:41:50,126 --> 00:41:52,493
You can do it, Meg.
You just need balance.

653
00:41:52,495 --> 00:41:54,128
Whoa!

654
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:55,428
This is awesome!

655
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,097
No, not awesome!

656
00:41:57,099 --> 00:41:59,069
Yoo-hoo!
Anybody home?

657
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,906
- Whoo-hoo!
- Nice balance, Mrs. Who.

658
00:42:06,043 --> 00:42:07,778
Oh, no, no, no.

659
00:42:11,248 --> 00:42:13,717
Finally, a little color.

660
00:42:24,827 --> 00:42:27,896
Whoa!

661
00:42:27,898 --> 00:42:29,338
Who's there?

662
00:42:30,433 --> 00:42:33,037
Uninvited guest
is very unsettling!

663
00:42:33,771 --> 00:42:35,706
I do not like visitation!

664
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:37,708
Whatsit.

665
00:42:39,341 --> 00:42:41,112
I really need a doorbell.

666
00:42:48,784 --> 00:42:51,220
Whoo! Well, you obviously
don't understand

667
00:42:51,222 --> 00:42:52,521
the importance of balance...

668
00:42:52,523 --> 00:42:54,188
of moderation...

669
00:42:56,092 --> 00:42:57,758
of the Happy Medium.

670
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,793
You sound like my mother.

671
00:42:59,795 --> 00:43:01,798
Is your mother a baritone?

672
00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:04,599
How's it going, Happy?

673
00:43:04,601 --> 00:43:06,266
Everything's fine, Whatsit.
You look nice.

674
00:43:06,268 --> 00:43:08,970
- I do?
- I like your outfit.

675
00:43:08,972 --> 00:43:11,206
It's like a person outfit.

676
00:43:11,208 --> 00:43:12,807
Oh, thank you.

677
00:43:12,809 --> 00:43:14,712
You look like a person.

678
00:43:16,646 --> 00:43:20,715
Thank you. You look
pretty okay as well.

679
00:43:20,717 --> 00:43:22,717
Thank you. Earth tones.

680
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:24,320
We need your insight.

681
00:43:24,954 --> 00:43:27,889
We are looking
for a man...

682
00:43:27,891 --> 00:43:31,428
who's lost
in the universe.

683
00:43:32,096 --> 00:43:33,329
My father.

684
00:43:35,733 --> 00:43:37,334
Dr. Murry.

685
00:43:40,137 --> 00:43:41,337
Handsome fellow.

686
00:43:46,408 --> 00:43:48,343
How am I supposed
to say no?

687
00:43:51,547 --> 00:43:52,982
Okay.

688
00:43:56,152 --> 00:43:57,784
Center yourself.

689
00:43:57,786 --> 00:43:59,889
One foot up, please.

690
00:44:00,157 --> 00:44:01,889
Okay.

691
00:44:01,891 --> 00:44:05,027
Now, very little
is up to <i>moi.</i>

692
00:44:05,029 --> 00:44:08,729
All right? Your energies
will affect what we see.

693
00:44:08,731 --> 00:44:12,266
So, core in,
spine long...

694
00:44:12,268 --> 00:44:14,905
...shoulders down...

695
00:44:16,406 --> 00:44:17,407
buttocks taut.

696
00:44:19,677 --> 00:44:22,309
Close your eyes.

697
00:44:22,311 --> 00:44:23,345
You're kidding.

698
00:44:24,081 --> 00:44:25,780
Do I look like I'm kidding?

699
00:44:25,782 --> 00:44:27,050
Very much so.

700
00:44:27,717 --> 00:44:29,519
- A little.
- I'm not.

701
00:44:31,721 --> 00:44:33,621
I'm not.

702
00:44:33,623 --> 00:44:35,826
Let's try this
again. Now...

703
00:44:36,726 --> 00:44:38,428
relax the face...

704
00:44:39,495 --> 00:44:41,662
close your eyes...

705
00:44:41,664 --> 00:44:44,397
and open your memories.

706
00:44:44,399 --> 00:44:46,337
Think about your father.

707
00:44:50,007 --> 00:44:50,938
No!

708
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:53,276
I can't, I can't.
I'm sorry, I can't.

709
00:44:57,047 --> 00:44:58,411
I'm sorry, but...

710
00:44:58,413 --> 00:45:01,583
I really just... I really
don't understand...

711
00:45:01,585 --> 00:45:05,787
how thinking about him
is going to help us find him.

712
00:45:05,789 --> 00:45:08,225
All I do
is think about him.

713
00:45:09,357 --> 00:45:10,390
I'm sorry, Mrs. Which,

714
00:45:10,392 --> 00:45:12,827
but I think we need
to show her something.

715
00:45:12,829 --> 00:45:16,030
She needs to understand
what's possible.

716
00:45:16,032 --> 00:45:18,868
She needs to know
what's at stake.

717
00:45:20,904 --> 00:45:24,041
Close your eyes.
See with mine.

718
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:28,477
This time...

719
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:31,182
don't look away.

720
00:45:43,659 --> 00:45:45,892
<i>The IT's home
may be Camazotz...</i>

721
00:45:45,894 --> 00:45:48,095
<i>but through darkness,</i>

722
00:45:48,097 --> 00:45:51,699
<i>The IT's reach
spreads far beyond.</i>

723
00:45:51,701 --> 00:45:53,870
<i>Even to your own planet.</i>

724
00:45:56,905 --> 00:45:59,072
<i>The only thing
in the universe...</i>

725
00:45:59,074 --> 00:46:02,876
<i>that travels
faster than light...</i>

726
00:46:02,878 --> 00:46:04,081
<i>is the darkness.</i>

727
00:46:05,648 --> 00:46:08,148
<i>The IT invades
the place inside of us</i>

728
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:10,251
<i>where hope and joy lives...</i>

729
00:46:10,253 --> 00:46:11,786
We're happy to announce
the promotion

730
00:46:11,788 --> 00:46:14,121
of one of our current
faculty members...

731
00:46:14,123 --> 00:46:15,923
to be our new principal.

732
00:46:15,925 --> 00:46:17,390
That faculty member

733
00:46:17,392 --> 00:46:20,361
is three-time science teacher
of the year...

734
00:46:20,363 --> 00:46:21,695
James Jenkins.

735
00:46:21,697 --> 00:46:24,298
Come on up,
Principal Jenkins.

736
00:46:26,302 --> 00:46:28,905
<i>...replaces it
with jealousy...</i>

737
00:46:39,315 --> 00:46:40,617
<i>and judgment...</i>

738
00:46:43,451 --> 00:46:44,922
<i>pain...</i>

739
00:46:47,657 --> 00:46:49,390
<i>and despair.</i>

740
00:46:49,392 --> 00:46:51,126
What's up, Pops?

741
00:46:51,128 --> 00:46:52,459
How you doing tonight?

742
00:46:52,461 --> 00:46:54,393
Hey, man, don't do that.

743
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:57,132
- What you got up in here?
- What are you doing, man?

744
00:46:57,134 --> 00:46:59,466
Man, do you know how I work
for this stuff?

745
00:46:59,468 --> 00:47:01,070
Hey, man.

746
00:47:04,507 --> 00:47:05,840
84...

747
00:47:05,842 --> 00:47:07,408
82...

748
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:08,575
82?

749
00:47:08,577 --> 00:47:11,713
I mean, are you even trying
or are you just an idiot?

750
00:47:11,715 --> 00:47:14,715
Because if this is the best
you can do, it's pathetic!

751
00:47:14,717 --> 00:47:16,950
You look at me
when I'm talking to you!

752
00:47:16,952 --> 00:47:18,655
This is pathetic!

753
00:47:22,958 --> 00:47:25,561
You see?
This is what The IT does.

754
00:47:27,697 --> 00:47:32,169
One person at a time...

755
00:47:33,003 --> 00:47:35,536
until fear takes over.

756
00:47:35,538 --> 00:47:37,541
Fear turns to rage.

757
00:47:39,809 --> 00:47:43,047
And rage leads to violence.

758
00:47:45,348 --> 00:47:47,551
And then
there's a tipping point.

759
00:47:48,918 --> 00:47:51,019
If we do not act soon...

760
00:47:51,021 --> 00:47:54,325
darkness will fall
across the universe.

761
00:47:55,257 --> 00:47:56,590
We...

762
00:47:56,592 --> 00:48:02,065
we're in search of warriors
who can fight The IT...

763
00:48:03,099 --> 00:48:07,337
and who can
bring hope back.

764
00:48:09,337 --> 00:48:10,673
Your father.

765
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:15,112
My father?

766
00:48:24,486 --> 00:48:26,753
Be a warrior.

767
00:48:26,755 --> 00:48:28,192
Can you?

768
00:48:31,827 --> 00:48:33,697
I'll try.

769
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:37,668
Your father sounds
like a good man.

770
00:48:38,802 --> 00:48:40,337
How about we find him?

771
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:43,640
Good. Okay.

772
00:48:45,708 --> 00:48:46,907
Good, good, good.

773
00:48:46,909 --> 00:48:48,543
- Yeah.
- Okay.

774
00:48:48,545 --> 00:48:50,010
Now, we're grounded.
We're centered, right?

775
00:48:50,012 --> 00:48:52,112
- Okay, yeah.
- Okay.

776
00:48:52,114 --> 00:48:55,018
You can do this. Okay?

777
00:48:55,619 --> 00:48:57,688
You're choosing not to.

778
00:49:06,762 --> 00:49:09,462
But what if...

779
00:49:10,333 --> 00:49:12,702
What if he doesn't
wanna be found?

780
00:49:16,072 --> 00:49:21,144
It's okay to fear
the answers, Meg.

781
00:49:22,911 --> 00:49:25,581
But you can't avoid them.

782
00:49:27,016 --> 00:49:28,882
Trust me.

783
00:49:28,884 --> 00:49:30,885
You don't wanna
end up like me,

784
00:49:30,887 --> 00:49:33,456
a weirdo with a beard
living in a cave.

785
00:49:38,927 --> 00:49:41,764
Your father
didn't forget you.

786
00:49:45,134 --> 00:49:47,237
You're too precious.

787
00:49:50,072 --> 00:49:51,940
All right, you ready?

788
00:49:51,942 --> 00:49:53,677
Mmm. Yeah.

789
00:49:56,012 --> 00:49:59,750
Center yourself.
Where is he?

790
00:50:02,951 --> 00:50:04,419
Okay.

791
00:50:05,188 --> 00:50:07,489
Now we're
getting a vision.

792
00:50:10,826 --> 00:50:11,828
Okay.

793
00:51:33,143 --> 00:51:36,579
Love.
That's the frequency.

794
00:51:42,518 --> 00:51:44,621
<i>That's it, Meg.</i>

795
00:51:45,155 --> 00:51:47,655
<i>He started in Uriel.</i>

796
00:51:47,657 --> 00:51:50,661
<i>Then he went to Ixchel.
Keep going, Meg.</i>

797
00:51:51,426 --> 00:51:54,231
<i>Oh! There's Aunt Beast!</i>

798
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:02,673
<i>Oh, no,
he's going to Camazotz.</i>

799
00:52:03,404 --> 00:52:04,404
No!

800
00:52:04,406 --> 00:52:06,610
- Whoa, whoa.
- No.

801
00:52:39,341 --> 00:52:41,141
I'm so sorry, Meg.

802
00:52:41,143 --> 00:52:43,444
The IT got to him
before we could.

803
00:52:43,446 --> 00:52:45,411
We thought he could
join the fight,

804
00:52:45,413 --> 00:52:47,317
but now we need
to fight for him.

805
00:52:49,952 --> 00:52:53,956
So, how are we gonna
get my father off Camazotz?

806
00:52:55,357 --> 00:52:59,563
We can't tesser
to Camazotz.

807
00:53:00,762 --> 00:53:04,268
We can only tesser
where we find light...

808
00:53:05,068 --> 00:53:07,271
for we are light.

809
00:53:07,869 --> 00:53:11,505
Camazotz is all darkness.

810
00:53:11,507 --> 00:53:15,443
This is no longer a search.
It's a rescue.

811
00:53:16,213 --> 00:53:20,181
We must go back to Earth...

812
00:53:20,183 --> 00:53:21,484
speak to your mother...

813
00:53:22,951 --> 00:53:24,985
regroup.

814
00:53:24,987 --> 00:53:29,523
No, no, no. I cannot leave
here without my father.

815
00:53:29,525 --> 00:53:32,491
It's for the best, Meg.
We have to make a plan.

816
00:53:32,493 --> 00:53:35,462
Please. Please!
I've come all this way.

817
00:53:35,464 --> 00:53:38,632
We're too close to finding
him to turn back!

818
00:53:38,634 --> 00:53:41,034
"Planning is essential."

819
00:53:41,036 --> 00:53:42,838
Churchill, British.

820
00:53:46,576 --> 00:53:49,911
No, no, no. Please!
He's running out of time.

821
00:53:49,913 --> 00:53:51,579
No, we cannot!

822
00:53:51,581 --> 00:53:52,780
<i>We have to save him.</i>

823
00:53:52,782 --> 00:53:56,117
<i>We can't give up.
There must be a way!</i>

824
00:53:56,119 --> 00:53:58,052
<i>Don't leave him!
We can't!</i>

825
00:53:58,054 --> 00:53:59,056
<i>Dad!</i>

826
00:54:10,766 --> 00:54:12,568
Where are we?

827
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:15,539
Where are the Misses?

828
00:54:17,005 --> 00:54:19,009
This place
feels weird.

829
00:54:23,679 --> 00:54:25,782
Look! The Misses.

830
00:54:40,797 --> 00:54:42,063
Thank goodness
you made it.

831
00:54:42,065 --> 00:54:43,399
I was so worried.

832
00:54:44,333 --> 00:54:45,900
Are you okay,
are you hurt at all?

833
00:54:45,902 --> 00:54:47,969
We're okay.

834
00:54:47,971 --> 00:54:51,873
Am I losing my senses or did
you just use your own words?

835
00:54:51,875 --> 00:54:56,309
She's weakening.
As am I and Mrs. Whatsit.

836
00:54:56,311 --> 00:54:58,512
Wait,
what's wrong?

837
00:54:58,514 --> 00:55:00,083
Where... Where are we?

838
00:55:01,317 --> 00:55:02,853
Camazotz.

839
00:55:03,952 --> 00:55:07,521
Your will to find your father
took over our tesser...

840
00:55:07,523 --> 00:55:09,925
and re-directed it from Earth.

841
00:55:13,094 --> 00:55:15,762
We must leave this planet.

842
00:55:15,764 --> 00:55:17,030
And we do not have
the strength

843
00:55:17,032 --> 00:55:18,464
to take you with us.

844
00:55:18,466 --> 00:55:21,401
We can
barely tesser ourselves.

845
00:55:21,403 --> 00:55:23,907
You must continue on
without us.

846
00:55:24,606 --> 00:55:26,777
You must find your father.

847
00:55:28,577 --> 00:55:31,278
And know that
you're going to be tested

848
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,780
every step of the way.

849
00:55:33,782 --> 00:55:36,885
You'll encounter things
you think you know

850
00:55:36,887 --> 00:55:38,088
but you don't.

851
00:55:39,289 --> 00:55:44,127
Here is the place
to be suspicious, okay?

852
00:55:47,931 --> 00:55:49,063
We're fading.

853
00:55:49,065 --> 00:55:52,298
Can't we at least leave them
with something to help them?

854
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:54,802
Yes. Gifts.

855
00:55:54,804 --> 00:55:56,439
I love gifts.

856
00:56:00,408 --> 00:56:02,288
They work well
in a moment of peril...

857
00:56:03,746 --> 00:56:07,183
for they see
that which is enfolded.

858
00:56:08,083 --> 00:56:11,788
Not gone, just enfolded.

859
00:56:15,925 --> 00:56:20,163
Meg. Trouble,
problematic Meg.

860
00:56:21,831 --> 00:56:24,835
To you I give
the gift of your faults.

861
00:56:27,103 --> 00:56:29,202
You're welcome.

862
00:56:29,204 --> 00:56:32,641
You do know my faults
are the bad qualities, right?

863
00:56:33,208 --> 00:56:35,077
Are they really? Hmm.

864
00:56:36,412 --> 00:56:38,579
Well then, you're all set.

865
00:56:38,581 --> 00:56:42,485
My gift is my command.

866
00:56:43,318 --> 00:56:45,889
Stay together.

867
00:56:46,655 --> 00:56:49,226
Don't let anyone
separate you.

868
00:56:50,491 --> 00:56:53,728
This is a planet
of many faces...

869
00:56:53,730 --> 00:56:57,298
run by one cruel
and vicious mind.

870
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:00,333
The IT desires
our strongest lights.

871
00:57:00,335 --> 00:57:02,204
Do not give in.

872
00:57:02,938 --> 00:57:04,537
We're going now.

873
00:57:04,539 --> 00:57:05,742
Be careful.

874
00:57:06,475 --> 00:57:08,541
"When shall we three
meet again?

875
00:57:08,543 --> 00:57:11,080
"In thunder,
lightning or in rain?"

876
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:13,148
Shakespeare.

877
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:18,885
Keep going.
We'll be watching.

878
00:57:29,331 --> 00:57:31,034
What's happening?

879
00:57:32,268 --> 00:57:34,267
Wait. Where's
Charles Wallace?

880
00:57:34,269 --> 00:57:35,903
He was just here!

881
00:57:38,909 --> 00:57:40,574
Charles Wallace!

882
00:57:40,576 --> 00:57:41,675
Charles Wallace!

883
00:57:41,677 --> 00:57:43,978
- Charles Wallace!
- Charles Wallace!

884
00:57:45,047 --> 00:57:46,581
<i>There's danger here.</i>

885
00:57:46,583 --> 00:57:49,282
<i>He's safe over the wall.</i>

886
00:57:49,284 --> 00:57:50,819
<i>Wait at the stream.</i>

887
00:57:56,824 --> 00:57:58,561
<i>Get to the wall.</i>

888
00:58:01,998 --> 00:58:04,266
What is that?

889
00:58:06,702 --> 00:58:08,135
<i>Get to the wall!</i>

890
00:58:08,137 --> 00:58:09,202
Run!

891
00:58:35,331 --> 00:58:37,431
It's getting closer!

892
00:58:37,433 --> 00:58:39,002
Go, go, go! Faster!

893
00:58:46,509 --> 00:58:48,043
There's the wall!

894
00:58:52,681 --> 00:58:54,783
We gotta get
over the wall!

895
00:59:06,529 --> 00:59:07,661
Run faster!

896
00:59:07,663 --> 00:59:10,666
- Faster is not gonna help!
- Faster!

897
00:59:39,228 --> 00:59:40,230
Calvin!

898
00:59:40,996 --> 00:59:42,363
Look, look!

899
00:59:43,164 --> 00:59:45,433
See what it's doing?

900
00:59:48,003 --> 00:59:51,074
It's picking up stuff
and throwing it over!

901
00:59:55,978 --> 00:59:59,813
Range is at fifty,
I don't know. Velocity...

902
00:59:59,815 --> 01:00:01,849
We won't make it that way!

903
01:00:01,851 --> 01:00:04,449
No, Meg!
We have to keep going!

904
01:00:04,451 --> 01:00:06,155
This is the only way!

905
01:00:10,626 --> 01:00:12,962
Do you trust me?

906
01:00:13,462 --> 01:00:15,031
I trust you!

907
01:00:16,331 --> 01:00:17,933
Okay.

908
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:30,179
Run, Calvin, run!

909
01:01:28,971 --> 01:01:31,940
How did you do that whole
thing with the log?

910
01:01:33,041 --> 01:01:35,610
It's just a physics thing.

911
01:01:35,612 --> 01:01:39,413
The classic slingshot maneuver.

912
01:01:40,782 --> 01:01:42,918
Just a physics thing?

913
01:01:44,286 --> 01:01:47,322
You have no idea
how incredible you are...

914
01:01:48,757 --> 01:01:50,292
do you?

915
01:01:57,733 --> 01:02:00,502
You're the one
who came with me.

916
01:02:02,972 --> 01:02:06,307
You didn't
have to do that.

917
01:02:06,309 --> 01:02:09,312
You're the one who
doesn't have to be here...

918
01:02:09,777 --> 01:02:12,047
but you are.

919
01:02:13,548 --> 01:02:15,317
You're the one who's...

920
01:02:26,329 --> 01:02:28,497
I like your hair.

921
01:02:32,634 --> 01:02:34,503
Thank you.

922
01:02:36,605 --> 01:02:37,974
Meg! Calvin!

923
01:02:38,907 --> 01:02:42,443
You made it!
I couldn't see you!

924
01:02:43,377 --> 01:02:45,746
I couldn't tell!

925
01:02:45,748 --> 01:02:49,251
I saw houses down there.
Come on!

926
01:02:55,157 --> 01:02:56,925
Is Daddy down here?

927
01:02:58,392 --> 01:03:00,329
I hope so.

928
01:03:18,581 --> 01:03:20,847
I smell food.

929
01:03:20,849 --> 01:03:22,885
Like good,
roasted food.

930
01:03:25,822 --> 01:03:27,954
Who else is starving?

931
01:04:06,695 --> 01:04:08,430
I can't stand the sound.

932
01:04:13,168 --> 01:04:16,505
The rhythm. It hurts.

933
01:04:17,974 --> 01:04:19,208
Come here.

934
01:04:19,876 --> 01:04:21,376
Cover your ears.

935
01:04:35,056 --> 01:04:37,626
Darling, time for dinner!

936
01:05:01,215 --> 01:05:03,251
Are you lost, children?

937
01:05:04,654 --> 01:05:08,992
I bet you're hungry,
and in need of comfort.

938
01:05:11,927 --> 01:05:13,493
I have roasts...

939
01:05:13,495 --> 01:05:17,030
and potatoes,
and cakes of all sorts.

940
01:05:17,032 --> 01:05:18,433
I could eat.

941
01:05:18,833 --> 01:05:20,102
Um...

942
01:05:20,702 --> 01:05:21,936
Uh...

943
01:05:21,938 --> 01:05:23,239
No.

944
01:05:23,739 --> 01:05:25,208
Thanks. We're good.

945
01:05:31,179 --> 01:05:32,711
- No.
- Cakes of all sorts!

946
01:05:32,713 --> 01:05:33,847
No!

947
01:05:33,849 --> 01:05:36,048
Trust no one, remember?

948
01:05:44,525 --> 01:05:45,965
It's changing again.

949
01:05:49,998 --> 01:05:52,201
Is this
still Camazotz?

950
01:05:54,103 --> 01:05:56,639
They said it was
a planet of many faces.

951
01:06:29,337 --> 01:06:32,673
Do you think this person would
mind if I ate all their food?

952
01:06:32,675 --> 01:06:33,810
Probably.

953
01:06:35,844 --> 01:06:37,847
Hey! I'm right here!

954
01:06:38,914 --> 01:06:40,817
I'm right here!

955
01:06:42,083 --> 01:06:43,685
Hello!

956
01:06:45,621 --> 01:06:47,789
Hello! Friends!

957
01:06:48,657 --> 01:06:51,525
Hello, friends. Hey.

958
01:06:51,527 --> 01:06:53,126
How are you guys?

959
01:06:53,128 --> 01:06:54,628
Who are you?

960
01:06:54,630 --> 01:06:56,228
Oh, me? I'm nobody.

961
01:06:56,230 --> 01:07:00,233
But you can call me Red.
And you are...?

962
01:07:00,235 --> 01:07:04,469
Oh, I'm Calvin. This is Meg.
And this is Charles Wallace.

963
01:07:04,471 --> 01:07:05,639
Oh!

964
01:07:05,641 --> 01:07:07,809
You're Alex Murry's kids,
aren't you?

965
01:07:11,581 --> 01:07:12,746
You know my father?

966
01:07:12,748 --> 01:07:14,413
Yeah, yeah! I totally
know your father.

967
01:07:14,415 --> 01:07:16,535
He's a great guy. I just saw
him a couple minutes ago.

968
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,251
Where?

969
01:07:18,253 --> 01:07:19,753
I mean, we've been
looking for him.

970
01:07:19,755 --> 01:07:20,987
Can you take us to him?

971
01:07:20,989 --> 01:07:22,422
Yeah. Yeah.
Well, no, no, no.

972
01:07:22,424 --> 01:07:24,724
Yeah. Almost. He should be
done working pretty soon.

973
01:07:24,726 --> 01:07:28,161
He's kind of a busy guy.
You know, bit of a workaholic.

974
01:07:28,163 --> 01:07:29,763
But I don't have
to tell you that. Right?

975
01:07:30,933 --> 01:07:32,965
You know what?
Guys, sit down. Sit down.

976
01:07:32,967 --> 01:07:34,133
Relax. There's nothing
to do here.

977
01:07:34,135 --> 01:07:35,337
Nothing to worry about.

978
01:07:36,003 --> 01:07:37,706
Are you guys hungry?

979
01:07:39,007 --> 01:07:41,007
Everything's taken care of.

980
01:07:41,009 --> 01:07:44,445
In total. Without options
or alternatives.

981
01:07:45,446 --> 01:07:46,516
Hmm.

982
01:07:48,784 --> 01:07:50,482
You guys hungry?

983
01:07:50,484 --> 01:07:52,587
Well, I'll brave it for us.

984
01:08:03,764 --> 01:08:05,664
What's wrong, little guy?

985
01:08:05,666 --> 01:08:06,768
It tastes like...

986
01:08:08,103 --> 01:08:09,936
like sand.

987
01:08:09,938 --> 01:08:11,804
Does it?

988
01:08:11,806 --> 01:08:13,509
I don't taste any sand.

989
01:08:14,242 --> 01:08:15,644
Try mine.

990
01:08:21,249 --> 01:08:23,384
It's all sand!

991
01:08:23,619 --> 01:08:25,551
Ha!

992
01:08:25,553 --> 01:08:28,555
I thought you were like me,
Charles Wallace.

993
01:08:28,557 --> 01:08:30,990
I thought you were special.

994
01:08:30,992 --> 01:08:32,459
And you are.

995
01:08:33,062 --> 01:08:34,597
You passed the test.

996
01:08:35,998 --> 01:08:37,596
It's as simple as that.

997
01:08:37,598 --> 01:08:41,734
Simple as twice one is two.
Twice two is four.

998
01:08:41,736 --> 01:08:43,205
Twice three is six.

999
01:08:44,106 --> 01:08:45,672
Twice four is eight.

1000
01:08:45,674 --> 01:08:47,841
Twice five is 10.

1001
01:08:47,843 --> 01:08:49,775
Twice six is 12.

1002
01:08:49,777 --> 01:08:51,211
Twice seven is 14.

1003
01:08:51,213 --> 01:08:52,444
What are you doing?

1004
01:08:52,446 --> 01:08:53,881
Twice eight is 16.

1005
01:08:53,883 --> 01:08:56,550
Uh, we'd
like to see our father now.

1006
01:08:56,552 --> 01:08:58,955
You got it.
I'll take you right to him.

1007
01:09:00,355 --> 01:09:03,555
Charles Wallace.
Take my hand now.

1008
01:09:03,557 --> 01:09:04,726
Please.

1009
01:09:05,861 --> 01:09:07,395
No, thanks.

1010
01:09:12,034 --> 01:09:13,268
Oh, and, Meg...

1011
01:09:13,803 --> 01:09:14,837
Hey.

1012
01:09:17,138 --> 01:09:18,971
Thanks for everything.

1013
01:09:18,973 --> 01:09:20,942
You brought him right to us.

1014
01:09:27,549 --> 01:09:28,684
No! Stop!

1015
01:09:30,052 --> 01:09:31,382
My little brother!

1016
01:09:31,384 --> 01:09:32,984
- Charles Wallace!
- Please!

1017
01:09:33,723 --> 01:09:35,357
Charles Wallace!

1018
01:09:37,092 --> 01:09:38,292
Charles Wallace!

1019
01:09:38,294 --> 01:09:39,528
Move!

1020
01:09:40,929 --> 01:09:41,996
Charles Wallace!

1021
01:09:54,509 --> 01:09:56,243
Well, that was fun.

1022
01:09:56,245 --> 01:09:58,681
Welcome to Central
Central Intelligence.

1023
01:10:02,918 --> 01:10:04,320
Get away from him!

1024
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:08,520
Relax. Don't fight it.

1025
01:10:08,522 --> 01:10:10,524
It'll make it much easier,
I promise.

1026
01:10:10,526 --> 01:10:14,127
Please, Charles Wallace.
Please. He is dangerous.

1027
01:10:14,129 --> 01:10:15,261
What has he done to you?

1028
01:10:15,263 --> 01:10:16,394
Shut up, Meg!

1029
01:10:16,396 --> 01:10:17,864
Yeah. Shut up, Meg.

1030
01:10:17,866 --> 01:10:21,401
Sorry, Red.
Meg's always been a problem.

1031
01:10:21,403 --> 01:10:23,203
She's quite an aberration,
you know.

1032
01:10:23,205 --> 01:10:24,737
Yeah, I can tell.

1033
01:10:24,739 --> 01:10:28,207
But aberrations
are far more interesting.

1034
01:10:28,209 --> 01:10:30,377
Don't you think,
Charles Wallace?

1035
01:10:31,412 --> 01:10:34,146
That's so like you to try
to come to the rescue,

1036
01:10:34,148 --> 01:10:35,350
isn't it, Calvin?

1037
01:10:36,418 --> 01:10:39,451
Always so helpful.
Overly cheery.

1038
01:10:39,453 --> 01:10:41,186
Trying to please everyone.

1039
01:10:41,188 --> 01:10:42,788
Hoping to convince them...

1040
01:10:42,790 --> 01:10:46,258
that you're not just a burden
to your father and your world.

1041
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:47,663
Pathetic.

1042
01:10:53,034 --> 01:10:55,033
That's not why I do it.

1043
01:10:55,035 --> 01:10:56,569
Of course, it is!

1044
01:10:56,571 --> 01:10:58,605
Why else would you come
on this ridiculous

1045
01:10:58,607 --> 01:11:00,673
journey with people
you barely know?

1046
01:11:00,675 --> 01:11:02,975
Now that's enough,
Charles Wallace!

1047
01:11:02,977 --> 01:11:03,943
You need to stop!

1048
01:11:03,945 --> 01:11:06,682
It's enough when The IT
says it's enough!

1049
01:11:08,116 --> 01:11:10,449
Sit. I can take it
from here.

1050
01:11:10,451 --> 01:11:12,588
No doubt about that,
little guy.

1051
01:11:17,526 --> 01:11:21,597
Would you like to meet The IT?
That happy sadist.

1052
01:11:22,196 --> 01:11:23,829
Not especially.

1053
01:11:23,831 --> 01:11:26,000
Watch your tone!

1054
01:11:27,068 --> 01:11:29,235
I'm sorry.

1055
01:11:29,237 --> 01:11:32,838
We're just here
to see Dad. Remember?

1056
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:34,407
Your dad.

1057
01:11:34,409 --> 01:11:37,012
Flower of the universe.
Child of mine.

1058
01:11:38,047 --> 01:11:39,311
No.

1059
01:11:39,313 --> 01:11:41,616
I think you mean
your dad...

1060
01:11:42,117 --> 01:11:43,716
who left you...

1061
01:11:43,718 --> 01:11:47,820
who'd rather be anywhere else
in the universe than with you.

1062
01:11:47,822 --> 01:11:49,924
Why would you even
want to see him?

1063
01:11:53,094 --> 01:11:54,594
Oh, well.

1064
01:11:54,596 --> 01:11:56,531
I wish I could
take you to him.

1065
01:11:57,066 --> 01:11:58,634
But I can't.

1066
01:11:59,433 --> 01:12:00,767
He's gone.

1067
01:12:00,769 --> 01:12:02,234
He's not gone.

1068
01:12:04,338 --> 01:12:05,971
You're right.

1069
01:12:05,973 --> 01:12:10,145
He's not gone. And
yet, I don't see him.

1070
01:12:11,412 --> 01:12:13,648
He's...
He's not gone.

1071
01:12:22,958 --> 01:12:24,692
He's not gone.

1072
01:12:28,062 --> 01:12:29,798
Just enfolded.

1073
01:12:35,337 --> 01:12:37,039
What is it?

1074
01:12:41,177 --> 01:12:42,878
What do you see?

1075
01:12:45,445 --> 01:12:47,549
Topological order.

1076
01:12:48,215 --> 01:12:50,850
Um, fractal dimension.

1077
01:12:50,852 --> 01:12:53,086
Ooh. Clever.

1078
01:12:53,088 --> 01:12:54,557
That she is.

1079
01:13:04,799 --> 01:13:05,799
Oh.

1080
01:14:53,941 --> 01:14:55,043
Meg.

1081
01:14:58,745 --> 01:15:01,114
- Meg.
- Dad, it's...

1082
01:15:05,654 --> 01:15:07,289
- Dad.
- Meg.

1083
01:15:19,802 --> 01:15:20,869
Dad.

1084
01:15:22,804 --> 01:15:24,106
Dad.

1085
01:15:29,945 --> 01:15:31,080
Dad.

1086
01:15:32,681 --> 01:15:36,447
Is this a trick?
A dream?

1087
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:38,953
It's me, Dad. It's me.

1088
01:15:41,289 --> 01:15:43,192
I missed you so much.

1089
01:15:43,691 --> 01:15:45,859
My beautiful Meg.

1090
01:15:45,861 --> 01:15:48,931
I missed you
every second of every day.

1091
01:15:51,633 --> 01:15:53,302
Let me look at you.

1092
01:15:55,269 --> 01:15:56,839
Daddy.

1093
01:15:57,272 --> 01:15:58,707
Hi, Dad.

1094
01:16:06,048 --> 01:16:08,851
How long
have I been gone, baby?

1095
01:16:13,222 --> 01:16:14,990
How long have I been gone?

1096
01:16:21,262 --> 01:16:22,764
Four years.

1097
01:16:24,766 --> 01:16:27,036
You left four years ago.

1098
01:16:28,870 --> 01:16:29,871
No.

1099
01:16:31,005 --> 01:16:34,372
No. No. No.

1100
01:16:34,374 --> 01:16:36,744
No, that can't be. No.

1101
01:16:37,312 --> 01:16:39,578
No. I didn't.

1102
01:16:39,580 --> 01:16:42,515
No, I didn't leave you, baby.
I wouldn't.

1103
01:16:42,517 --> 01:16:45,118
I would never leave you,
sweetheart.

1104
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:48,420
I've been trapped here.

1105
01:16:48,422 --> 01:16:49,823
How did you get here?

1106
01:16:49,825 --> 01:16:50,957
It's dangerous here, Meglet.

1107
01:16:50,959 --> 01:16:52,859
You can't be here.
How did you get here?

1108
01:16:52,861 --> 01:16:55,731
You called out for us.
We came for you.

1109
01:16:57,431 --> 01:16:59,702
We're here
to bring you home, Dad.

1110
01:17:02,204 --> 01:17:03,402
"We"?

1111
01:17:03,404 --> 01:17:05,671
My friend Calvin and...

1112
01:17:05,673 --> 01:17:07,976
Charles Wallace
came with me.

1113
01:17:10,678 --> 01:17:14,313
Charles Wallace.
My baby boy is here?

1114
01:17:14,315 --> 01:17:15,447
Where is he?

1115
01:17:15,449 --> 01:17:16,919
Is he okay?

1116
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:22,489
The IT has done
something to him.

1117
01:17:34,669 --> 01:17:36,304
Charles Wallace.

1118
01:17:37,871 --> 01:17:39,572
Is that you, son?

1119
01:17:39,574 --> 01:17:40,840
Son?

1120
01:17:40,842 --> 01:17:42,777
Depends on who you ask.

1121
01:17:45,580 --> 01:17:47,082
Let me get
a good look at you.

1122
01:17:50,985 --> 01:17:52,425
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1123
01:17:53,620 --> 01:17:54,953
Charles Wallace.

1124
01:17:54,955 --> 01:17:56,958
You don't look like
how I pictured you.

1125
01:17:57,925 --> 01:17:59,559
I'm underwhelmed.

1126
01:17:59,561 --> 01:18:01,495
Charles Wallace.

1127
01:18:03,264 --> 01:18:04,333
Hey.

1128
01:18:04,999 --> 01:18:07,199
What has The IT done
to you?

1129
01:18:07,201 --> 01:18:09,538
The IT has shown me
my potential.

1130
01:18:10,705 --> 01:18:13,404
I can see the weaknesses
of any soul.

1131
01:18:13,406 --> 01:18:15,041
Like, take your soul.

1132
01:18:15,043 --> 01:18:18,346
So desperate
to matter in the universe...

1133
01:18:19,981 --> 01:18:23,152
you'd abandon your own family
and never look back.

1134
01:18:29,624 --> 01:18:31,794
That's not true,
I swear.

1135
01:18:32,626 --> 01:18:33,866
Doesn't matter.

1136
01:18:34,862 --> 01:18:36,761
Let's go meet The IT.

1137
01:18:36,763 --> 01:18:39,901
- No. No.
- Yes, yes.

1138
01:18:40,635 --> 01:18:41,801
Come on, now.

1139
01:18:41,803 --> 01:18:43,872
Don't make me drag you.

1140
01:18:46,708 --> 01:18:49,074
Okay. How about
you just take me?

1141
01:18:49,076 --> 01:18:49,941
No.

1142
01:18:49,943 --> 01:18:52,145
- Meg. Meg. Take me.
- Dad, no. No!

1143
01:18:52,147 --> 01:18:53,045
No.

1144
01:18:53,047 --> 01:18:54,680
I have to
do this, sweetheart.

1145
01:18:54,682 --> 01:18:55,948
We don't want you!

1146
01:18:55,950 --> 01:18:57,149
We've already had you!

1147
01:19:07,995 --> 01:19:09,230
Stop it!

1148
01:19:10,463 --> 01:19:11,464
Grab onto it!

1149
01:19:13,501 --> 01:19:14,533
Let us go!

1150
01:19:14,535 --> 01:19:19,105
Stop clawing the walls.
The IT's waiting for you.

1151
01:19:19,107 --> 01:19:20,239
You're hurting them!

1152
01:19:20,241 --> 01:19:21,975
And you're just
being impolite!

1153
01:19:21,977 --> 01:19:23,242
Stop!

1154
01:19:24,545 --> 01:19:25,547
Stop! Please!

1155
01:19:27,081 --> 01:19:28,282
Don't do this, please!

1156
01:19:29,950 --> 01:19:32,017
Please, don't do this!

1157
01:19:32,019 --> 01:19:34,923
This is all your fault,
Mr. Murry!

1158
01:19:36,057 --> 01:19:37,724
Can you
hear me? Meg!

1159
01:19:37,726 --> 01:19:38,992
Meg!

1160
01:19:38,994 --> 01:19:40,358
Meg, wake up, baby!

1161
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:41,492
Resist. Resist, Meg.

1162
01:19:41,494 --> 01:19:43,730
Don't give in to the darkness.
Don't give in! Meglet...

1163
01:19:43,732 --> 01:19:44,963
Meglet, wake up.

1164
01:19:44,965 --> 01:19:46,765
Wake up! Wake up! Meg!

1165
01:19:46,767 --> 01:19:47,969
Meg! Wake up!

1166
01:19:48,702 --> 01:19:49,836
Come on. Hold on.

1167
01:19:49,838 --> 01:19:51,537
Hold on, come on. Hold on!

1168
01:19:51,539 --> 01:19:52,739
Breathe.

1169
01:19:52,741 --> 01:19:54,273
Breathe, Meg, breathe!

1170
01:19:54,275 --> 01:19:56,373
Let her go. Let her give in.

1171
01:19:56,375 --> 01:19:57,676
Give up.

1172
01:19:57,678 --> 01:20:02,547
This is what you get when you
put yourself before family!

1173
01:20:02,549 --> 01:20:07,121
Please. Charles Wallace,
I'll do anything you want.

1174
01:20:08,290 --> 01:20:11,392
Charles Wallace
isn't here right now.

1175
01:20:12,526 --> 01:20:14,494
And even if he were...

1176
01:20:15,196 --> 01:20:17,762
you're powerless against us.

1177
01:20:17,764 --> 01:20:20,334
You have nothing
that we want.

1178
01:20:20,834 --> 01:20:23,367
Except for her.

1179
01:20:23,369 --> 01:20:24,372
No.

1180
01:20:31,345 --> 01:20:33,014
Forgive me.

1181
01:20:35,549 --> 01:20:38,483
Meg! Meg, wake up. Wake up!

1182
01:20:40,821 --> 01:20:42,257
Come on. Here.

1183
01:20:43,191 --> 01:20:45,190
You brought light
back to me, Meglet.

1184
01:20:45,192 --> 01:20:46,459
Maybe I can tesser again.

1185
01:20:48,295 --> 01:20:49,895
Hold on.
Hold on, stay with me.

1186
01:20:56,937 --> 01:20:58,606
It's working!

1187
01:20:59,540 --> 01:21:00,541
It's working.

1188
01:21:01,509 --> 01:21:02,807
Meg.

1189
01:21:02,809 --> 01:21:05,080
Meg. Meg, baby. Meg.

1190
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:08,583
We're going back home.
We're going back home.

1191
01:21:09,683 --> 01:21:10,816
Just a little longer.

1192
01:21:10,818 --> 01:21:12,286
Charles Wallace.

1193
01:21:13,154 --> 01:21:15,089
Just breathe. Just breathe.

1194
01:21:16,223 --> 01:21:19,527
The darkness has him.
We can't take him with us.

1195
01:21:21,996 --> 01:21:24,165
If we don't leave now,
we'll be trapped here forever.

1196
01:21:24,866 --> 01:21:27,033
How could you? How...

1197
01:21:27,035 --> 01:21:30,103
Meg, we have to.
The IT is gonna destroy us.

1198
01:21:30,105 --> 01:21:32,038
- It's gonna destroy you, Meg.
- How could you leave him?

1199
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:34,172
I'm gonna come back
for him, Meg.

1200
01:21:34,174 --> 01:21:36,042
How could you
leave him again?

1201
01:21:36,044 --> 01:21:37,909
I have to. I have to.

1202
01:21:37,911 --> 01:21:39,981
I can't lose
both of my children.

1203
01:21:40,548 --> 01:21:42,346
No, don't leave!

1204
01:21:42,348 --> 01:21:45,053
I won't leave him!
I won't leave my brother!

1205
01:21:45,585 --> 01:21:47,289
Stop! Stop!

1206
01:21:47,955 --> 01:21:49,121
Stop!

1207
01:21:49,123 --> 01:21:51,389
I won't tesser without him!

1208
01:21:51,391 --> 01:21:53,095
Stop!

1209
01:21:54,562 --> 01:21:57,329
Charles
Wallace, I'm coming.

1210
01:22:24,992 --> 01:22:27,461
Welcome.

1211
01:22:28,427 --> 01:22:33,300
You made the right decision
to join us.

1212
01:22:34,268 --> 01:22:36,404
Don't you feel better?

1213
01:22:37,138 --> 01:22:39,938
You look better.

1214
01:22:39,940 --> 01:22:44,109
I've known you
for a long time.

1215
01:22:44,111 --> 01:22:46,681
It's good
to finally have you here.

1216
01:22:49,817 --> 01:22:51,351
Charles Wallace.

1217
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:54,056
Charles Wallace.

1218
01:22:57,157 --> 01:22:59,093
Charles Wallace!

1219
01:23:03,830 --> 01:23:05,299
Hi, Meg.

1220
01:23:07,035 --> 01:23:08,603
We knew you'd be back.

1221
01:23:09,036 --> 01:23:10,603
We gotta say...

1222
01:23:10,605 --> 01:23:13,741
nothing we love more
than stupid courage.

1223
01:23:14,742 --> 01:23:15,940
"We"?

1224
01:23:15,942 --> 01:23:19,280
Oh.
Where are my manners?

1225
01:23:20,882 --> 01:23:23,350
Meg, meet The IT!

1226
01:23:27,855 --> 01:23:28,857
No!

1227
01:23:43,369 --> 01:23:45,904
Welcome to the darkest mind

1228
01:23:45,906 --> 01:23:47,341
in the universe.

1229
01:23:50,375 --> 01:23:52,480
Extraordinary,
don't you think?

1230
01:23:53,781 --> 01:23:55,684
That's one word for it.

1231
01:23:56,517 --> 01:23:59,284
We could really use
a gal like you.

1232
01:23:59,286 --> 01:24:01,422
So, what do you say?

1233
01:24:02,924 --> 01:24:04,358
You wanna join us?

1234
01:24:06,593 --> 01:24:07,661
No thanks.

1235
01:24:29,284 --> 01:24:31,283
Take a good look
at her.

1236
01:24:31,285 --> 01:24:33,487
She's a better version
of you.

1237
01:24:35,156 --> 01:24:38,123
She's sure to be popular.
Great student.

1238
01:24:38,125 --> 01:24:41,327
Principal Jenkins
is going to love her.

1239
01:24:41,329 --> 01:24:43,962
And Calvin
probably will, too.

1240
01:24:45,299 --> 01:24:46,899
She doesn't just have to
live in your imagination...

1241
01:24:46,901 --> 01:24:49,171
I can make her real.

1242
01:24:51,404 --> 01:24:53,172
You said
you wanted to come back

1243
01:24:53,174 --> 01:24:55,106
as someone else.

1244
01:24:55,108 --> 01:24:57,312
Join us, and I can make you
just like her.

1245
01:24:59,848 --> 01:25:01,216
She's perfect.

1246
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:07,322
No!

1247
01:25:12,927 --> 01:25:14,260
You better watch yourself...

1248
01:25:14,262 --> 01:25:16,729
or we'll do to you
what you did to her.

1249
01:25:16,731 --> 01:25:19,501
We don't care
whose sister you are!

1250
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:27,438
We're your only option,

1251
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:29,774
and we're starting
to not want you!

1252
01:25:29,776 --> 01:25:32,343
A feeling you're very
used to, actually.

1253
01:25:32,345 --> 01:25:34,913
No one in school likes you.

1254
01:25:34,915 --> 01:25:38,850
Your father left you
without so much as a goodbye.

1255
01:25:38,852 --> 01:25:42,623
Every bad thing you think
about yourself is true.

1256
01:25:43,457 --> 01:25:45,256
<i>"The wound is the place</i>

1257
01:25:45,258 --> 01:25:47,459
<i>"where the light enters you."</i>

1258
01:25:47,461 --> 01:25:48,862
<i>Be a warrior.</i>

1259
01:25:49,964 --> 01:25:51,630
<i>Can you?</i>

1260
01:25:51,632 --> 01:25:54,669
<i>To you I give
the gift of your faults.</i>

1261
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:02,777
I know my faults.

1262
01:26:04,245 --> 01:26:06,314
How I'm messy...

1263
01:26:07,815 --> 01:26:09,415
uncoordinated...

1264
01:26:10,985 --> 01:26:13,354
I don't trust anyone.

1265
01:26:15,022 --> 01:26:17,025
And most days,
I hate myself.

1266
01:26:19,827 --> 01:26:21,494
I'm impulsive...

1267
01:26:22,361 --> 01:26:23,897
and suspicious.

1268
01:26:25,866 --> 01:26:27,001
And yet...

1269
01:26:29,637 --> 01:26:30,769
you love me.

1270
01:26:30,771 --> 01:26:33,771
- What?
- Don't you, Charles Wallace?

1271
01:26:33,773 --> 01:26:35,543
- No!
- Shut up!

1272
01:26:38,178 --> 01:26:39,679
It's okay.

1273
01:26:39,681 --> 01:26:42,314
Few understand
just how weak light is.

1274
01:26:42,316 --> 01:26:44,283
Few are willing
to accept the fact

1275
01:26:44,285 --> 01:26:46,152
that love is just a word.

1276
01:26:46,154 --> 01:26:48,854
It's an empty,
meaningless word.

1277
01:26:48,856 --> 01:26:51,323
You can hurt me
when I say I love you,

1278
01:26:51,325 --> 01:26:52,824
but I'll love you anyway!

1279
01:26:52,826 --> 01:26:55,395
And you love me!

1280
01:26:56,830 --> 01:27:00,034
That's why you make milk
for me on stormy nights.

1281
01:27:01,936 --> 01:27:04,802
That's why you check in
on me during recess.

1282
01:27:06,775 --> 01:27:10,477
That's why you wanted to
find Daddy, to make me happy!

1283
01:27:12,213 --> 01:27:14,581
That's why the Misses
took a chance on me.

1284
01:27:15,449 --> 01:27:17,451
Because they felt your love.

1285
01:27:19,053 --> 01:27:22,090
And you should love me because
I deserve to be loved!

1286
01:27:23,190 --> 01:27:25,456
Stop it! Just, stop it!

1287
01:27:25,458 --> 01:27:29,127
I love you! I love you,
Charles Wallace! I love you!

1288
01:27:29,129 --> 01:27:30,464
Stop it!

1289
01:27:40,842 --> 01:27:42,140
Please...

1290
01:27:42,142 --> 01:27:44,275
I love you, Biscuits.

1291
01:27:44,277 --> 01:27:47,581
No love!

1292
01:27:49,282 --> 01:27:52,587
Only darkness!

1293
01:28:03,731 --> 01:28:05,131
Meg!

1294
01:28:13,741 --> 01:28:14,843
Meg.

1295
01:28:18,678 --> 01:28:19,813
Meg.

1296
01:28:21,414 --> 01:28:22,851
Meg, wake up.

1297
01:28:23,417 --> 01:28:25,082
Come on, Meg.

1298
01:28:25,084 --> 01:28:26,120
Please.

1299
01:29:20,406 --> 01:29:21,608
Whoa.

1300
01:29:32,986 --> 01:29:34,021
The Misses.

1301
01:29:34,922 --> 01:29:35,924
They came back.

1302
01:29:38,758 --> 01:29:41,527
Charles Wallace,
your light has returned.

1303
01:29:41,529 --> 01:29:43,628
Meg, you did it.

1304
01:29:43,630 --> 01:29:45,896
I tried.

1305
01:29:45,898 --> 01:29:48,833
Well, I knew you could
do it all along.

1306
01:29:48,835 --> 01:29:51,039
I never doubted you
for a second.

1307
01:29:51,871 --> 01:29:52,837
Well...

1308
01:29:52,839 --> 01:29:55,406
I used my faults,
like you said.

1309
01:29:55,408 --> 01:29:57,743
Such beautiful faults.

1310
01:29:57,745 --> 01:29:59,744
I'm so proud of you, Meg.

1311
01:29:59,746 --> 01:30:04,216
The universe is bright tonight
because of you.

1312
01:30:04,218 --> 01:30:06,284
You weakened The IT...

1313
01:30:06,286 --> 01:30:07,352
and you've given your Earth

1314
01:30:07,354 --> 01:30:10,157
and everyone on it
a real chance.

1315
01:30:11,291 --> 01:30:12,957
You should be proud.

1316
01:30:12,959 --> 01:30:17,029
Some of our best warriors
have come from Earth.

1317
01:30:17,031 --> 01:30:21,533
Einstein, Curie, Gandhi.

1318
01:30:21,535 --> 01:30:23,434
Austen. Kahlo.

1319
01:30:23,436 --> 01:30:24,569
Schindler.

1320
01:30:24,571 --> 01:30:27,005
Nelson Mandela.
Maya Angelou.

1321
01:30:27,007 --> 01:30:30,812
And now, Meg Murry.

1322
01:30:33,379 --> 01:30:34,615
Me?

1323
01:30:35,348 --> 01:30:37,850
What?

1324
01:30:37,852 --> 01:30:42,989
All those who are willing
to face the darkness...

1325
01:30:42,991 --> 01:30:47,627
and bring the best
of themselves to the light...

1326
01:30:47,629 --> 01:30:49,297
for the world.

1327
01:30:53,633 --> 01:30:55,802
This is where we leave you...

1328
01:30:56,603 --> 01:30:59,072
to become warriors on Earth.

1329
01:30:59,973 --> 01:31:02,507
Now, Meg, it's time...

1330
01:31:02,509 --> 01:31:05,778
for you to start the tesser
for all of us...

1331
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:08,148
and make your way back home.

1332
01:31:08,949 --> 01:31:09,951
What?

1333
01:31:11,285 --> 01:31:12,287
Me?

1334
01:31:14,589 --> 01:31:16,724
You want me
to start the tesser?

1335
01:31:17,691 --> 01:31:21,292
"Tomorrow, there'll be
more of us."

1336
01:31:21,294 --> 01:31:23,330
Miranda, American.

1337
01:31:52,093 --> 01:31:53,795
<i>Goodbye, my loves.</i>

1338
01:31:55,029 --> 01:31:57,898
<i>Farewell,
my little warriors.</i>

1339
01:31:58,999 --> 01:32:01,768
<i>Until we meet again.</i>

1340
01:32:09,576 --> 01:32:11,178
See you at home!

1341
01:33:53,413 --> 01:33:54,814
Oh!

1342
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:56,280
Meg, you did it!

1343
01:33:56,282 --> 01:33:59,019
You absolutely,
gloriously tessered.

1344
01:34:06,626 --> 01:34:07,861
Daddy!

1345
01:34:20,206 --> 01:34:21,539
Hey.

1346
01:34:21,541 --> 01:34:23,044
You did it.

1347
01:34:24,343 --> 01:34:25,946
I sure did.

1348
01:34:30,718 --> 01:34:31,919
Mommy!

1349
01:34:37,857 --> 01:34:39,192
Hi. Uh...

1350
01:34:41,161 --> 01:34:42,829
Are you okay?

1351
01:34:44,866 --> 01:34:46,300
I'm okay, Dad.

1352
01:34:46,767 --> 01:34:48,001
Good.

1353
01:34:52,338 --> 01:34:54,308
I'm sorry, Meg.

1354
01:34:55,408 --> 01:34:56,476
I, uh...

1355
01:35:02,749 --> 01:35:05,987
I wanted to shake hands
with the universe.

1356
01:35:15,995 --> 01:35:18,397
But I should've been
holding yours.

1357
01:35:31,279 --> 01:35:33,281
I love you so much.

1358
01:35:44,557 --> 01:35:46,358
I love you, too.

1359
01:36:31,972 --> 01:36:34,105
Charles Wallace?
What are you doing outside?

1360
01:36:34,107 --> 01:36:35,175
Mommy!

1361
01:36:37,977 --> 01:36:39,877
Well, well, okay.

1362
01:36:39,879 --> 01:36:42,414
Thanks. What's going on?

1363
01:36:44,817 --> 01:36:46,251
Wait.

1364
01:36:46,253 --> 01:36:47,918
Am I asleep?

1365
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:49,322
Am I dreaming?

1366
01:36:52,791 --> 01:36:54,024
No...

1367
01:36:54,026 --> 01:36:55,962
you're not sleeping.

1368
01:36:58,165 --> 01:37:00,534
And it's important
you know that.

1369
01:37:02,468 --> 01:37:04,036
Why?

1370
01:37:04,038 --> 01:37:05,940
Because Meg
brought you something.

1371
01:37:21,955 --> 01:37:24,190
I'm sorry I'm late.

1372
01:37:27,093 --> 01:37:29,395
I'm so, so sorry.

1373
01:37:52,351 --> 01:37:53,988
How...

1374
01:37:56,121 --> 01:37:58,458
- Where...
- Your calculations.

1375
01:37:59,759 --> 01:38:02,062
They gave us the universe.

1376
01:38:09,202 --> 01:38:11,437
I think
I'm gonna go home.

1377
01:38:12,472 --> 01:38:14,041
You sure?

1378
01:38:15,175 --> 01:38:16,177
Yeah.

1379
01:38:17,476 --> 01:38:21,747
There are some things
I need to say to my dad.

1380
01:38:21,749 --> 01:38:24,050
Maybe now I can
finally say them.

1381
01:38:27,387 --> 01:38:29,186
It's funny
how it took a trip

1382
01:38:29,188 --> 01:38:31,624
around the universe
to get me there.

1383
01:38:45,172 --> 01:38:46,706
Can I call you later?

1384
01:38:48,541 --> 01:38:49,744
Yeah.

1385
01:39:09,295 --> 01:39:11,231
I knew you could do it.

1386
01:39:11,732 --> 01:39:13,366
Love you.

1387
01:39:13,933 --> 01:39:15,401
Always.

1388
01:39:25,410 --> 01:39:26,878
- Hey!
- Daddy, I have

1389
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:28,680
a new word for the day.
Wanna hear it?

1390
01:39:28,682 --> 01:39:29,747
Absolutely.

1391
01:39:29,749 --> 01:39:30,881
Home.

1392
01:39:30,883 --> 01:39:32,451
Thank you.
