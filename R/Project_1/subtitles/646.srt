1
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,226
Hello.

2
00:02:54,268 --> 00:02:56,270
Hello, sweetie.

3
00:02:56,354 --> 00:02:59,148
Daddy.

4
00:02:59,231 --> 00:03:00,483
It's early.

5
00:03:00,608 --> 00:03:02,151
Yeah, I know.

6
00:03:02,234 --> 00:03:04,779
I just wanted to let you know
I'm sending you something.

7
00:03:04,862 --> 00:03:07,490
Mmm. Does it smell nice?

8
00:03:07,573 --> 00:03:08,699
No,

9
00:03:08,783 --> 00:03:10,576
but it's sparkly.

10
00:03:11,661 --> 00:03:13,871
Does it have a receipt?

11
00:03:13,955 --> 00:03:17,792
I'm sending it
to you from the store.

12
00:03:20,044 --> 00:03:21,462
Why don't you just come by?

13
00:03:21,504 --> 00:03:23,172
We'll have some breakfast, hmm?

14
00:03:23,255 --> 00:03:25,675
Well, it'd be a long trip.

15
00:03:25,758 --> 00:03:28,219
I'm in Venice.

16
00:03:31,263 --> 00:03:33,641
With your parole officer's
approval, of course.

17
00:03:33,724 --> 00:03:35,977
Well, I like the guy, Stella,
you know that,

18
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,104
but we never really connected.

19
00:03:38,187 --> 00:03:40,982
So I think I've paid
my P.O. his last visit.

20
00:03:41,065 --> 00:03:42,692
What are you into, Dad?

21
00:03:42,775 --> 00:03:43,901
Don't break my heart.

22
00:03:43,985 --> 00:03:45,569
You told me you were through.

23
00:03:45,653 --> 00:03:48,406
After this I am, I swear to you.

24
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,909
Is Charlie there?

25
00:03:51,993 --> 00:03:53,661
I'm on a cell phone, darling.

26
00:03:53,744 --> 00:03:57,164
I'll call you tomorrow
from a land line.

27
00:03:57,206 --> 00:03:58,332
I love you.

28
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,001
Go back to sleep. Bye.

29
00:04:00,084 --> 00:04:01,502
D... Dad?

30
00:04:06,674 --> 00:04:07,800
I love you, too.

31
00:04:14,515 --> 00:04:15,933
I sent it.

32
00:04:16,017 --> 00:04:17,560
You're supposed
to do your shopping

33
00:04:17,643 --> 00:04:18,853
after we pull off the job.

34
00:04:18,936 --> 00:04:20,104
I feel so optimistic.

35
00:04:20,187 --> 00:04:21,439
So?

36
00:04:21,522 --> 00:04:22,857
How do you feel?

37
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,442
I'm fine.

38
00:04:24,525 --> 00:04:25,735
Fine?

39
00:04:25,818 --> 00:04:27,737
You know what "fine"
stands for, don't you?

40
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,405
Yeah, unfortunately.

41
00:04:29,488 --> 00:04:30,656
"Freaked out."

42
00:04:30,698 --> 00:04:31,741
- "Insecure."
- "Neurotic."

43
00:04:31,824 --> 00:04:33,326
- And "Emotional."
- Good.

44
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:35,536
See those columns behind you?

45
00:04:36,871 --> 00:04:38,414
What about them?

46
00:04:38,497 --> 00:04:40,750
That's where they used
to string up thieves

47
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:41,751
who felt "fine."

48
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:43,794
Well... after you.

49
00:04:51,218 --> 00:04:53,012
For after the haul.

50
00:04:54,055 --> 00:04:55,806
Hope I get to fire it up.

51
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,475
Still no word
from the garbagemen?

52
00:04:57,558 --> 00:04:58,684
No.

53
00:04:58,726 --> 00:04:59,685
If they're no-shows,

54
00:04:59,727 --> 00:05:01,145
three months of prep
down the tubes

55
00:05:01,228 --> 00:05:03,189
and I dragged you out
of retirement for nothing.

56
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,899
Oh, this is fun.
I like this.

57
00:05:04,982 --> 00:05:07,568
You've taken over the reins,
all the worries.

58
00:05:07,652 --> 00:05:10,196
Me loosey-goosey,
just along for the ride.

59
00:05:10,237 --> 00:05:11,781
I'm glad you're
enjoying yourself, John.

60
00:05:11,864 --> 00:05:12,949
Just remember, a police boat

61
00:05:13,032 --> 00:05:14,992
can get from the station
to our position in seven.

62
00:05:15,076 --> 00:05:16,953
That means you got
four minutes to work your magic.

63
00:05:17,036 --> 00:05:18,245
Now, you told me ten,

64
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:20,206
and you said I would have five.

65
00:05:20,247 --> 00:05:21,999
When?

66
00:05:24,168 --> 00:05:26,921
Do not be messing
with me right now, okay?

67
00:05:27,004 --> 00:05:28,422
- I will kick your ass.
- Oh, yeah?

68
00:05:28,506 --> 00:05:29,757
Come on, take your best shot.

69
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,758
Come on.

70
00:05:30,841 --> 00:05:32,176
What? Uh-oh.

71
00:05:42,853 --> 00:05:43,771
Come on.

72
00:05:43,854 --> 00:05:44,981
Let's go.

73
00:05:45,064 --> 00:05:46,440
What is it this time?

74
00:05:46,524 --> 00:05:47,900
Da Vinci. Architect.

75
00:05:47,942 --> 00:05:49,151
Engineer. Painter.

76
00:05:49,235 --> 00:05:50,444
Yeah, fascinating.

77
00:05:50,528 --> 00:05:51,654
Hey, look, look. Check this out.

78
00:05:51,737 --> 00:05:55,449
"Learn the language of poetry,
art, romance, sex."

79
00:05:56,867 --> 00:05:59,120
Unlike you, my friend,
I don't need a guidebook.

80
00:05:59,203 --> 00:06:00,454
Can we go? Please?

81
00:06:00,538 --> 00:06:02,957
Right, guv'nor.

82
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,458
Come along,
make yourself useful.

83
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:05,751
Untie that line.

84
00:06:05,793 --> 00:06:06,919
Today.

85
00:06:07,003 --> 00:06:08,087
Yeah.

86
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:09,130
Yeah, Gilligan.

87
00:06:09,213 --> 00:06:10,256
If you don't mind.

88
00:06:48,502 --> 00:06:49,629
- We set?
- Yeah. I've enhanced

89
00:06:49,712 --> 00:06:51,964
the viewing matrix to track both
the Cartesian coordinates

90
00:06:52,006 --> 00:06:53,424
and three altitude angles,

91
00:06:53,507 --> 00:06:55,051
the yaw, pitch and roll
to give us

92
00:06:55,134 --> 00:06:56,677
the exact position and
orientation of our baby.

93
00:06:56,761 --> 00:06:57,720
We're in Italy.

94
00:06:57,803 --> 00:06:59,013
Speak English.

95
00:06:59,096 --> 00:07:00,806
Steve, how we looking?

96
00:07:00,848 --> 00:07:05,436
Papa took the boat to work at
8:15, so the garage is empty.

97
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:09,815
Mama left with daughter
at 8:30 for preschool as usual.

98
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:12,068
So for the next 45 minutes,

99
00:07:12,151 --> 00:07:13,861
we own this place, gentlemen.

100
00:07:13,945 --> 00:07:16,280
Still no word
from the garbagemen?

101
00:07:16,364 --> 00:07:18,407
Hey, who got you
the beekeepers in Budapest?

102
00:07:18,491 --> 00:07:19,533
They'll be there.

103
00:07:19,617 --> 00:07:20,993
You can trust these guys.

104
00:07:21,035 --> 00:07:23,412
Steve, how many times
do I have to tell you?

105
00:07:23,537 --> 00:07:27,917
I trust everyone... I just don't
trust the devil inside them.

106
00:08:16,132 --> 00:08:17,091
We're in.

107
00:08:34,483 --> 00:08:36,527
Just tell me where to paint.

108
00:08:44,535 --> 00:08:46,245
Your men are still not
in position?

109
00:08:46,287 --> 00:08:47,788
They will be.

110
00:08:47,872 --> 00:08:49,874
Well, you don't know that,
Steve. We should abort.

111
00:08:49,957 --> 00:08:53,753
I'm sorry, John, but I think
that's Charlie's call now.

112
00:08:58,299 --> 00:09:00,676
Our baby's being taken
out of here tonight.

113
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,927
This is our only shot at it.

114
00:09:05,431 --> 00:09:06,599
Charlie?

115
00:09:08,267 --> 00:09:09,393
Keep going?

116
00:09:09,477 --> 00:09:11,395
It's up to you, kid.

117
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,397
It's a go.

118
00:09:17,193 --> 00:09:18,152
Okay, Steve.

119
00:09:19,987 --> 00:09:24,158
From the west wall,
measure 14 feet, eight inches.

120
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:25,409
Got it.

121
00:09:25,493 --> 00:09:27,161
Now measure
eight feet, five inches

122
00:09:27,244 --> 00:09:28,788
from the north wall.

123
00:09:28,871 --> 00:09:30,581
That's the northwest corner
of our baby.

124
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:32,959
Got it.

125
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:34,085
Well, it's right above you.

126
00:10:07,368 --> 00:10:08,452
Now, paint.

127
00:10:08,577 --> 00:10:11,831
Two feet, nine inches wide.

128
00:10:11,914 --> 00:10:14,000
Two feet, five inches deep.

129
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,294
Okay, Left Ear.
You're up.

130
00:10:17,712 --> 00:10:20,006
14 feet four inches
from that west wall.

131
00:10:45,906 --> 00:10:47,283
Yeah.

132
00:10:49,535 --> 00:10:50,453
Bene.

133
00:10:51,746 --> 00:10:54,248
The garbagemen
are in position, John.

134
00:12:57,204 --> 00:12:58,748
All right, Charlie,
someone just called it in.

135
00:12:58,831 --> 00:13:01,500
The police boat's
heading your way.

136
00:13:01,584 --> 00:13:03,169
Seven minutes and counting.

137
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,503
Let's go.

138
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:27,169
We got four minutes
to load and leave. Let's go.

139
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,122
Whoa! Whoa!

140
00:17:37,902 --> 00:17:39,403
Hey, you guys. Come here.

141
00:17:43,157 --> 00:17:45,826
I want to propose a toast.

142
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,828
To us.

143
00:17:47,912 --> 00:17:48,871
Yay!

144
00:17:52,249 --> 00:17:54,835
And I want to propose
a toast to Charlie

145
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:58,339
because we just stole
$35 million worth of gold

146
00:17:58,381 --> 00:18:00,299
without even holding a gun

147
00:18:00,341 --> 00:18:01,968
because he planned this
down to a "T."

148
00:18:02,051 --> 00:18:04,303
Nobody else
could have done that.

149
00:18:04,345 --> 00:18:05,388
Nobody. Charlie!

150
00:18:05,471 --> 00:18:07,181
- Charlie!
- Yay!

151
00:18:07,264 --> 00:18:08,975
Thank you.

152
00:18:09,058 --> 00:18:10,309
So, come on, gentlemen.

153
00:18:10,351 --> 00:18:12,103
Shopping list.
Who's doing what?

154
00:18:12,186 --> 00:18:13,396
Spare no dirty details.

155
00:18:13,521 --> 00:18:14,814
Come on, you guys.

156
00:18:14,855 --> 00:18:17,066
Take a lesson from an old man.

157
00:18:17,149 --> 00:18:18,859
Don't spend it.
Invest.

158
00:18:20,361 --> 00:18:21,654
In what?

159
00:18:21,737 --> 00:18:23,614
In gold.

160
00:18:25,616 --> 00:18:26,951
Let's figure out

161
00:18:27,034 --> 00:18:29,161
how to get out of here first,
all right?

162
00:18:29,203 --> 00:18:31,289
What are you getting, Rob?

163
00:18:31,372 --> 00:18:32,665
I don't know...
there's a lot of things

164
00:18:32,707 --> 00:18:33,833
you can buy with a lot of money.

165
00:18:33,874 --> 00:18:35,626
You know, I'm just thinking
about naked girls

166
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:36,836
in leather seats.

167
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:38,421
Obviously. See?

168
00:18:38,504 --> 00:18:40,673
Suppose I get
the Aston Martin Vanquish?

169
00:18:40,715 --> 00:18:42,008
There's not a lot
a girl won't do

170
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:44,093
on the passenger seat
of one of those things.

171
00:18:44,176 --> 00:18:45,845
I'm going to get a NAD T770

172
00:18:45,928 --> 00:18:48,723
digital decoder with a 70-watt
amp and Burr Brown DACs.

173
00:18:49,807 --> 00:18:50,683
Yeah.

174
00:18:50,725 --> 00:18:51,851
It's a big stereo.

175
00:18:51,892 --> 00:18:54,103
Speakers so loud they blow
women's clothes off.

176
00:18:54,186 --> 00:18:55,354
Now you're talking.

177
00:18:56,939 --> 00:18:59,442
$35 million... you can't get
more creative than that, man?

178
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:01,694
I'm going to Andalucia,
south of Spain...

179
00:19:01,736 --> 00:19:03,237
right there.

180
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:04,864
Get me a big house...

181
00:19:04,905 --> 00:19:06,532
get me a library
full of first editions.

182
00:19:06,616 --> 00:19:07,908
Get a room for my shoes.

183
00:19:07,992 --> 00:19:09,952
What about you, Steve?

184
00:19:10,036 --> 00:19:12,371
I don't know...
I haven't decided yet.

185
00:19:12,538 --> 00:19:14,248
You haven't decided yet?

186
00:19:14,332 --> 00:19:16,208
Come on, man,
is it the mountain air, just...?

187
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,209
I liked what you said.

188
00:19:17,251 --> 00:19:18,753
I'll take one of each of yours.

189
00:19:20,421 --> 00:19:22,048
Well, well, two of everything

190
00:19:22,089 --> 00:19:23,549
- For Steve then.
- Two of those.

191
00:19:23,591 --> 00:19:24,634
Oy!

192
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,724
Loved the toast.

193
00:19:31,766 --> 00:19:33,976
But you could've pulled this off
with your eyes closed.

194
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,395
No, you were incredible.

195
00:19:36,437 --> 00:19:37,897
Just incredible.

196
00:19:37,939 --> 00:19:39,398
You saw the whole picture.

197
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,733
You covered all the angles.

198
00:19:41,776 --> 00:19:43,569
You know, Charlie,

199
00:19:43,611 --> 00:19:46,739
there are two kinds of thieves
in this world:

200
00:19:46,781 --> 00:19:49,408
the ones who steal
to enrich their lives,

201
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:53,412
and the ones who steal
to define their lives.

202
00:19:53,454 --> 00:19:55,414
Don't be the latter.

203
00:19:55,456 --> 00:19:57,583
Makes you miss out
on what's really important

204
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,418
in this life.

205
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,921
What are you talking about,
John?

206
00:20:01,963 --> 00:20:03,422
You've been a good father.

207
00:20:03,464 --> 00:20:07,093
Sitting in prisons
doesn't make you a good father.

208
00:20:07,134 --> 00:20:09,679
I spent half my kid's life
in prison.

209
00:20:09,762 --> 00:20:13,683
Don't get to be my age
with nothing but this, Charlie.

210
00:20:13,766 --> 00:20:17,728
Find somebody you want to spend
the rest of your life with

211
00:20:17,812 --> 00:20:19,897
and hold onto her forever.

212
00:20:19,981 --> 00:20:22,984
- Okay?
- Hey.

213
00:20:23,067 --> 00:20:25,111
Let's go...
I'm freezing my ass off.

214
00:20:25,152 --> 00:20:27,446
Yeah.

215
00:20:27,488 --> 00:20:29,448
Steve's getting cold.

216
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:30,950
You, too?

217
00:20:30,992 --> 00:20:32,118
I'm all right.

218
00:20:33,494 --> 00:20:34,787
I love you, kid.

219
00:20:34,829 --> 00:20:36,247
You did really great.

220
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:38,791
Thanks, John.

221
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:42,253
Let's go.

222
00:20:50,469 --> 00:20:53,639
Money

223
00:20:53,681 --> 00:20:56,267
It's a gas

224
00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:03,482
Grab that cash with both hands
and make a stash

225
00:21:03,649 --> 00:21:07,028
New car, caviar,
four-star daydream...

226
00:21:07,111 --> 00:21:08,904
You should've seen Rob
behind the wheel of that boat.

227
00:21:08,988 --> 00:21:10,615
He was like Don Johnson.

228
00:21:10,698 --> 00:21:12,700
Oy, yeah, from Brixton.

229
00:21:12,783 --> 00:21:14,869
Yeah, what the hell do you know
about Brixton, eh?

230
00:21:21,042 --> 00:21:23,919
Look at this idiot
right in the middle of the road.

231
00:21:24,003 --> 00:21:25,504
What's this, what's this?

232
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:30,509
Who the hell are these guys?

233
00:21:34,305 --> 00:21:34,972
Hey!

234
00:21:35,056 --> 00:21:36,140
Take your hands off the wheel.

235
00:21:36,223 --> 00:21:36,849
Steve!

236
00:21:40,227 --> 00:21:42,188
Don't even think about it...
just do it.

237
00:21:47,568 --> 00:21:48,402
No, no, no, no,

238
00:21:48,486 --> 00:21:49,695
- No, no, no, no, John.
- Steve,

239
00:21:49,737 --> 00:21:50,696
what the hell are you doing?

240
00:21:50,738 --> 00:21:52,114
Made a few plans of my own.

241
00:21:55,409 --> 00:21:57,787
There's nowhere you can go
where we won't find you, Steve.

242
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:58,788
You know that.

243
00:21:58,871 --> 00:22:00,081
I think that's probably right,
John.

244
00:22:01,248 --> 00:22:01,707
Go! Go!

245
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:49,106
Charlie.

246
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:52,151
We got to go, Charlie.

247
00:25:15,943 --> 00:25:17,612
You always work in the dark?

248
00:25:17,695 --> 00:25:20,364
Makes me feel like I'm alone.

249
00:25:22,742 --> 00:25:23,659
Not bad.

250
00:25:23,743 --> 00:25:25,411
Not bad, Stella.

251
00:25:25,536 --> 00:25:27,246
Damn. Hurley couldn't
crack that safe.

252
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:28,581
Neither could Spears.
Now you know

253
00:25:28,623 --> 00:25:29,582
who to call first.

254
00:25:29,624 --> 00:25:30,625
You're expensive, Stella.

255
00:25:30,666 --> 00:25:33,419
Those guys cut us a break
on subpoena jobs.

256
00:25:33,586 --> 00:25:35,254
Good will, community service.

257
00:25:35,296 --> 00:25:37,423
I do it for the money, Paul.

258
00:25:37,465 --> 00:25:38,966
I'll be sending you a bill.

259
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:40,843
Don't you want to see
what's inside?

260
00:25:40,926 --> 00:25:41,927
I never look inside.

261
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,597
Have a good day.
Hey, George.

262
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,723
Hi, Stella.

263
00:25:45,806 --> 00:25:48,684
I came, I saw, I kicked some ass

264
00:25:48,768 --> 00:25:51,938
The pain I cause,
it makes me laugh

265
00:25:51,979 --> 00:25:53,648
'Cause the way I do my thing
is strange

266
00:25:53,731 --> 00:25:56,442
Time, time for this girl
to sing

267
00:25:56,484 --> 00:25:59,236
Damn if I thought
that you would change

268
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,447
And my life would stay
the same

269
00:26:01,572 --> 00:26:03,950
Things will come
and things will go

270
00:26:03,991 --> 00:26:06,327
And one thing I know
for sure

271
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:10,373
Is that the wreckoning,
the wreckoning, the wreckoning

272
00:26:10,456 --> 00:26:12,041
I'm walking out the door

273
00:26:12,124 --> 00:26:15,336
Wreckoning, the wreckoning,
the wreckoning

274
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:17,171
Oh, it's time...

275
00:26:20,675 --> 00:26:21,634
How long to crack it?

276
00:26:21,676 --> 00:26:24,095
Four minutes and 43 seconds.

277
00:26:24,178 --> 00:26:25,096
Oh! You're the man.

278
00:26:25,179 --> 00:26:26,138
What's on the lineup?

279
00:26:26,222 --> 00:26:27,348
Todd Milliken called.

280
00:26:27,431 --> 00:26:28,933
He has a prototype
combination lock.

281
00:26:29,016 --> 00:26:30,351
He wants you to test out.

282
00:26:30,434 --> 00:26:31,560
He says he added

283
00:26:31,644 --> 00:26:34,605
two false contact points
on the tumbler.

284
00:26:34,689 --> 00:26:36,440
I'll pretend to be stumped
for a couple of seconds,

285
00:26:36,565 --> 00:26:37,650
give him a thrill.

286
00:26:37,692 --> 00:26:39,944
And, there's a Charlie Croker
in your office.

287
00:26:41,112 --> 00:26:43,239
Says you two know each other.

288
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,036
Charlie Croker.

289
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,663
Hey, Stella.

290
00:26:53,666 --> 00:26:55,626
Didn't I tell you I never
want to see you again?

291
00:26:57,044 --> 00:26:59,297
I think it was when you told me
how my father died,

292
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,798
right in front of your eyes,

293
00:27:00,881 --> 00:27:02,717
after you pulled him
in for one last job.

294
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,140
We found him, Stella.

295
00:27:09,223 --> 00:27:11,976
He's in Los Angeles.

296
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:13,102
The gold bricks he stole from us

297
00:27:13,185 --> 00:27:14,520
had a Balinese dancer
stamped on them.

298
00:27:14,562 --> 00:27:15,813
I just got word,

299
00:27:15,896 --> 00:27:17,231
from a contact of mine
called Skinny Pete,

300
00:27:17,315 --> 00:27:19,650
that a gold dealer out in L.A.
has been buying those bricks.

301
00:27:19,734 --> 00:27:21,360
Yeah?

302
00:27:21,402 --> 00:27:22,778
Well, how do you know it's him?

303
00:27:24,071 --> 00:27:26,574
Skinny Pete sent me this.

304
00:27:26,657 --> 00:27:28,826
Steve changed his last
name to Frazelli.

305
00:27:34,915 --> 00:27:36,792
Why you telling me
all of this?

306
00:27:36,876 --> 00:27:39,045
Been checking out the databases
behind safe companies.

307
00:27:39,128 --> 00:27:40,671
Found out Steve
had a Worthington 1000

308
00:27:40,755 --> 00:27:42,214
delivered to his home office.

309
00:27:42,256 --> 00:27:43,716
You don't install
a Worthington 1000

310
00:27:43,758 --> 00:27:45,384
unless you've got something
really big to guard.

311
00:27:45,426 --> 00:27:46,427
No, you don't.

312
00:27:46,552 --> 00:27:47,428
The problem now is no one

313
00:27:47,553 --> 00:27:48,763
in my crew
can handle Steve's safe.

314
00:27:48,846 --> 00:27:50,931
And I need somebody
I can trust.

315
00:27:51,015 --> 00:27:52,600
Look, I'm a professional
safe and vault technician.

316
00:27:52,683 --> 00:27:53,935
I'm not a thief.

317
00:27:54,018 --> 00:27:55,895
Hey, it's not about the gold,
Stella, okay?

318
00:27:55,937 --> 00:27:57,188
John was like a father
to me, too.

319
00:28:02,902 --> 00:28:04,153
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

320
00:28:04,236 --> 00:28:06,155
I just can't move on until
I've set things right.

321
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:13,788
I've moved on.

322
00:29:18,477 --> 00:29:19,604
Come on, Charlie.

323
00:29:20,688 --> 00:29:21,689
Come on.

324
00:29:27,653 --> 00:29:28,904
Hello?

325
00:29:28,988 --> 00:29:30,823
I want to see the look
on that man's face

326
00:29:30,906 --> 00:29:32,241
when his gold is gone.

327
00:29:32,325 --> 00:29:35,494
He took my father from me;
I'm taking this.

328
00:29:40,041 --> 00:29:40,958
She's in.

329
00:29:41,042 --> 00:29:42,668
That's a good thing?

330
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,794
It's a very good thing.

331
00:29:43,878 --> 00:29:45,713
She can crack a Worthington 1000
without even flinching.

332
00:29:45,796 --> 00:29:47,298
I'm not sure having
a civilian on the crew's

333
00:29:47,381 --> 00:29:48,424
a good idea, Charlie.

334
00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:49,425
She's got the skill

335
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,635
and she's got the motivation.

336
00:29:50,718 --> 00:29:52,136
Exactly.

337
00:29:52,219 --> 00:29:53,429
She's emotional.

338
00:29:53,554 --> 00:29:55,723
You know what happens
when emotion gets into it.

339
00:29:55,806 --> 00:29:57,350
Look, don't kid yourself,
all right?

340
00:29:57,433 --> 00:29:58,851
We're all emotional on this one.

341
00:29:58,893 --> 00:30:01,145
Let's go.

342
00:30:01,228 --> 00:30:02,730
Are you ready?

343
00:30:02,813 --> 00:30:03,898
Of course I am.

344
00:30:06,525 --> 00:30:08,069
You're not ready.

345
00:30:32,259 --> 00:30:34,845
That was quick.

346
00:30:34,929 --> 00:30:35,972
Where are they?

347
00:30:36,055 --> 00:30:37,223
We're a little early.

348
00:30:37,306 --> 00:30:39,892
I didn't expect us to get here
quite that fast.

349
00:30:41,102 --> 00:30:42,144
There.

350
00:30:42,228 --> 00:30:43,271
That's Lyle.

351
00:30:43,354 --> 00:30:44,981
He's my computer genius.

352
00:30:49,527 --> 00:30:52,446
You know, he's who really
invented Napster.

353
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:53,906
At least that's how
Lyle tells it.

354
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:57,118
Said Shawn Fanning
was his roommate in college

355
00:30:57,201 --> 00:30:59,036
and stole his idea.

356
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,926
Think it's his first time
riding that bike, though.

357
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:17,638
Hey.

358
00:31:19,598 --> 00:31:20,725
Oh...

359
00:31:22,101 --> 00:31:23,394
You okay?

360
00:31:24,812 --> 00:31:26,230
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

361
00:31:27,315 --> 00:31:28,399
That's Left Ear.

362
00:31:29,025 --> 00:31:30,443
Demolition and explosives.

363
00:31:30,526 --> 00:31:31,444
When he was ten,

364
00:31:31,611 --> 00:31:33,446
he put one too many M-80s
in the toilet bowl.

365
00:31:33,487 --> 00:31:36,115
Fire...

366
00:31:36,198 --> 00:31:37,908
Whoa.

367
00:31:37,992 --> 00:31:39,076
Yeah, that was cool.

368
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,328
How'd you do that?

369
00:31:40,411 --> 00:31:41,454
What?!

370
00:31:41,495 --> 00:31:42,788
How'd you do that?

371
00:31:42,872 --> 00:31:43,873
What?!

372
00:31:43,956 --> 00:31:46,292
I said,
how did you do that?

373
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:48,753
What?!

374
00:31:48,836 --> 00:31:50,463
Lost the hearing
in his right ear.

375
00:31:50,504 --> 00:31:52,715
He's been blowing
stuff up ever since.

376
00:31:55,676 --> 00:31:57,345
Handsome Rob.

377
00:31:57,428 --> 00:31:58,471
Premier wheel man.

378
00:31:58,638 --> 00:31:59,972
Once drove all the way
from Los Angeles

379
00:32:00,014 --> 00:32:01,932
just so he could set the record
for longest freeway chase.

380
00:32:10,816 --> 00:32:12,985
- You're a heartbreaker...
- You know, he got 110

381
00:32:13,069 --> 00:32:14,445
Iove letters
sent to his jail cell

382
00:32:14,528 --> 00:32:16,113
from women
who saw him on the news?

383
00:32:16,197 --> 00:32:18,324
You're a heartbreaker

384
00:32:18,407 --> 00:32:19,909
Dream-maker

385
00:32:19,992 --> 00:32:20,910
Love-taker

386
00:32:20,993 --> 00:32:22,995
Don't you mess around,
no, no, no...

387
00:32:27,917 --> 00:32:29,168
And you?

388
00:32:29,251 --> 00:32:31,754
I never heard
how you got your start.

389
00:32:31,837 --> 00:32:33,965
Me?

390
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:36,717
Well, I've been a thief
since I had baby teeth.

391
00:32:36,801 --> 00:32:39,845
Okay, you both know what to do.

392
00:32:39,929 --> 00:32:41,347
Cough it up, now!

393
00:32:41,389 --> 00:32:45,267
Come on, now,
shake it, shake it, baby, ho!

394
00:32:45,351 --> 00:32:47,270
One, two, three, baby...

395
00:32:48,145 --> 00:32:49,313
Watch it, spaz!

396
00:32:49,397 --> 00:32:51,065
Hey, now, do, re, me, baby...

397
00:32:51,148 --> 00:32:52,108
Hey, what's your problem, man?

398
00:32:52,191 --> 00:32:54,652
A-B-C, it's easy

399
00:32:54,735 --> 00:32:56,487
As one, two, three...

400
00:32:57,571 --> 00:32:58,489
Hey, Charlie.

401
00:32:58,572 --> 00:32:59,699
Good to see you, man.

402
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,950
- Looking good.
- Yeah?

403
00:33:01,033 --> 00:33:03,411
- Charlie Hustle.
- Good to see you.

404
00:33:03,494 --> 00:33:04,412
Hello, Charlie.

405
00:33:04,495 --> 00:33:06,080
Rob, what's up?
Good?

406
00:33:06,163 --> 00:33:07,665
Guys...

407
00:33:07,748 --> 00:33:08,833
Stella Bridger.

408
00:33:08,916 --> 00:33:11,127
Hi.

409
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:12,128
How you doing?

410
00:33:12,211 --> 00:33:13,337
Nice to meet you.

411
00:33:13,421 --> 00:33:14,422
Phones?

412
00:33:14,547 --> 00:33:15,715
Yeah, they're all
fresh and clean,

413
00:33:15,756 --> 00:33:17,216
I got internal chips in them.

414
00:33:17,258 --> 00:33:18,384
Please change them twice a day.

415
00:33:18,426 --> 00:33:20,177
We will get heat on line.

416
00:33:20,261 --> 00:33:21,429
I.D. s?

417
00:33:23,973 --> 00:33:25,308
"James Hymen?"

418
00:33:25,391 --> 00:33:27,602
Come on, man, one time,
give me a cool name.

419
00:33:27,685 --> 00:33:29,854
140 pounds? Try 165.

420
00:33:29,937 --> 00:33:31,188
Try lifting some weights.

421
00:33:31,272 --> 00:33:32,690
- Try lifting up these.
- Guys, enough.

422
00:33:32,773 --> 00:33:34,191
Come on, we leave
tomorrow, all right?

423
00:33:34,275 --> 00:33:35,192
Let's go.

424
00:33:35,276 --> 00:33:36,360
Hey, Charlie...

425
00:33:37,653 --> 00:33:39,447
Handsome, can you help
him with the bike?

426
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:42,742
Yeah, help Knievel set up
for his next jump.

427
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,329
Like a sound you hear
that lingers in your ear

428
00:33:46,412 --> 00:33:51,000
But you can't forget,
from sundown to sunset

429
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:53,919
No, no

430
00:33:53,961 --> 00:33:56,464
It puts a brand-new kind
of thinkin' in your mind

431
00:33:56,631 --> 00:33:57,923
And you can't go wrong

432
00:33:57,965 --> 00:34:02,720
'Cause you're groovin'
all day long, ha-ha!

433
00:34:02,803 --> 00:34:05,264
California soul

434
00:34:05,348 --> 00:34:08,017
Ooh-ooh-ooh

435
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:12,063
California soul...

436
00:34:12,146 --> 00:34:14,815
Man, out of all of the places
for a thief to hide,

437
00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:16,567
this joker picked Hollywood.

438
00:34:16,651 --> 00:34:18,903
He's a punk,
but he ain't stupid.

439
00:34:18,986 --> 00:34:20,446
All right...

440
00:34:20,571 --> 00:34:22,281
we need to figure out a way
to get in Steve's house

441
00:34:22,365 --> 00:34:24,116
and make a video blueprint
of the interior.

442
00:34:24,158 --> 00:34:26,285
I want audio surveillance
on his phone.

443
00:34:26,369 --> 00:34:27,870
Oh, yeah, I been wanting
to try something.

444
00:34:27,954 --> 00:34:29,372
I crack into the phone company's

445
00:34:29,455 --> 00:34:31,207
remote monitoring system,
and fool it into thinking

446
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:32,291
there's a legal tap on the line.

447
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:33,334
Just reroute the digital copies

448
00:34:33,417 --> 00:34:34,877
of the calls to our own
listening post.

449
00:34:34,961 --> 00:34:36,295
I been doing it
to my ex for years.

450
00:34:36,379 --> 00:34:37,838
How long?

451
00:34:37,922 --> 00:34:39,548
No... how long will it take?

452
00:34:39,632 --> 00:34:41,133
Not how long have you
been doing it to your ex.

453
00:34:41,217 --> 00:34:42,969
I'll burn through the night;
I'll have it running by morning.

454
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,139
Sorry I'm late.

455
00:34:47,223 --> 00:34:49,016
We got to work on getting
Steve out of the house.

456
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,768
Stella, how much time you need
with the Worthington?

457
00:34:50,851 --> 00:34:53,312
Five minutes flat.

458
00:34:53,354 --> 00:34:54,855
Don't be cocky, young lady.

459
00:34:54,897 --> 00:34:57,024
It's not the same as opening
a safe for the police.

460
00:34:58,401 --> 00:35:00,027
The perspiration
on your fingertips,

461
00:35:00,111 --> 00:35:01,570
your heart's pounding
in your ears...

462
00:35:01,654 --> 00:35:02,697
whole different ball game.

463
00:35:04,323 --> 00:35:06,242
I appreciate your concern.
I'll be fine.

464
00:35:07,952 --> 00:35:09,120
Look, just remember,

465
00:35:09,203 --> 00:35:10,246
this is all the easy part, okay?

466
00:35:10,329 --> 00:35:11,580
It's the getaway
that can get us caught.

467
00:35:11,664 --> 00:35:12,790
So what's the sketch?

468
00:35:12,873 --> 00:35:13,874
We drive to Union Station.

469
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:16,752
Getaway car goes
right onto the train with us.

470
00:35:16,836 --> 00:35:18,421
We need to know exactly
how long it's going to take

471
00:35:18,546 --> 00:35:20,548
to get from Steve's house
to Union Station.

472
00:35:50,953 --> 00:35:52,747
Oh, great.

473
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,165
Carson Security System.

474
00:35:54,248 --> 00:35:56,083
How good is it?

475
00:35:56,167 --> 00:35:57,835
Carson's held
an annual contest...

476
00:35:57,918 --> 00:36:00,463
$50,000 to anybody
that can bypass the system.

477
00:36:00,588 --> 00:36:03,049
The Who's Who of ex-cons
always show up.

478
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:06,260
Five years running,
no one's been paid.

479
00:36:06,344 --> 00:36:08,929
Okay, party people,
here's the status.

480
00:36:09,013 --> 00:36:10,306
It's an anti-scaling fence.

481
00:36:10,389 --> 00:36:12,350
It's hardened,
electro-plated steel.

482
00:36:12,433 --> 00:36:14,393
Yeah, I'm going
to have to paint that up

483
00:36:14,477 --> 00:36:15,561
with some nitromin.

484
00:36:15,645 --> 00:36:16,896
Security on the property?

485
00:36:16,979 --> 00:36:18,356
Got an armed guard here.

486
00:36:18,439 --> 00:36:19,398
Little rent-a-cop,

487
00:36:19,482 --> 00:36:20,900
with a nine-millimeter
on his hip.

488
00:36:20,983 --> 00:36:22,401
But that booth...

489
00:36:22,443 --> 00:36:25,404
Security booth looks prime
for a chemical grenade.

490
00:36:25,446 --> 00:36:26,822
Nitromin, chemical grenades...

491
00:36:26,906 --> 00:36:29,033
I mean, that stuff's
pretty hard to come by.

492
00:36:29,116 --> 00:36:30,910
Yeah, Lyle, it's a bear market.

493
00:36:32,787 --> 00:36:34,413
Shit.

494
00:36:35,957 --> 00:36:37,249
This dude got dogs.

495
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:39,085
I don't do dogs.

496
00:36:39,168 --> 00:36:41,671
I had a...
real bad experience, man.

497
00:36:41,754 --> 00:36:43,005
What happened?

498
00:36:43,089 --> 00:36:46,258
I had a bad experience.

499
00:36:46,342 --> 00:36:48,094
Damn it. I'm deaf.

500
00:37:03,192 --> 00:37:04,443
You turn in your badge

501
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:06,612
and your weap...
Oh, shoot.

502
00:37:06,696 --> 00:37:08,990
Turn in your badge
and your weapon!

503
00:37:10,074 --> 00:37:10,992
Crush.

504
00:37:11,075 --> 00:37:12,076
I don't want to see you

505
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:14,328
anywhere near
this investigation.

506
00:37:14,412 --> 00:37:17,248
And turn in
your badge and your weapon.

507
00:37:17,331 --> 00:37:18,249
I don't want to see you

508
00:37:18,332 --> 00:37:19,875
anywhere near
this investigation.

509
00:37:22,253 --> 00:37:24,255
Hey! It's a green!

510
00:37:24,338 --> 00:37:26,924
Turn in your badge
and your weapon.

511
00:37:27,008 --> 00:37:28,801
- Green!
- I don't want to see you

512
00:37:28,843 --> 00:37:29,593
anywhere near this...

513
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:32,179
Turn in your badge
and your weapon.

514
00:37:34,932 --> 00:37:37,727
Unbelievable.

515
00:37:49,363 --> 00:37:51,365
There he is.

516
00:38:10,134 --> 00:38:12,762
Let's get to work.

517
00:38:15,139 --> 00:38:19,226
It's either bad traffic,
peak traffic,

518
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:20,728
slit-your-wrist traffic.

519
00:38:20,811 --> 00:38:23,022
You know, five people died
from smoking

520
00:38:23,105 --> 00:38:24,398
in between traffic lights today.

521
00:38:24,482 --> 00:38:26,400
You know, they do have
the Metrorail, Rob.

522
00:38:26,484 --> 00:38:27,777
You could always use that.

523
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:28,986
That'd be ideal

524
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,988
for carrying a ton of gold,
wouldn't it, genius?

525
00:38:32,031 --> 00:38:33,199
What's your guesstimate?

526
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,743
The last 20 times
I've done the journey,

527
00:38:35,826 --> 00:38:38,913
you've got an average of 32
minutes and a top time of 50,

528
00:38:38,996 --> 00:38:40,915
but if we had green
lights all the way,

529
00:38:40,998 --> 00:38:42,583
we could do it in 14 minutes.

530
00:38:42,667 --> 00:38:44,835
Wait, you couldn't get
through traffic?

531
00:38:48,214 --> 00:38:49,090
Whoa.

532
00:38:50,591 --> 00:38:53,928
We could do anything
with green lights all the way.

533
00:38:54,011 --> 00:38:55,888
Lyle?

534
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:57,765
Lyle?

535
00:38:59,183 --> 00:39:00,685
I'll see what I can do.

536
00:39:05,022 --> 00:39:06,983
You're right on time.

537
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,073
All these poor bastards
out there,

538
00:39:14,115 --> 00:39:15,908
putting their life
savings in banks,

539
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,910
and S&Ls, and mutual funds.

540
00:39:17,952 --> 00:39:20,246
How do they think,
when the collapse comes,

541
00:39:20,288 --> 00:39:22,081
they can depend
on the government?

542
00:39:22,123 --> 00:39:23,416
I don't think so.

543
00:39:23,499 --> 00:39:24,834
Are you taping me?

544
00:39:24,917 --> 00:39:26,585
Of course not.

545
00:39:26,627 --> 00:39:28,296
I never tape you...
come look,

546
00:39:28,379 --> 00:39:29,463
see for yourself.

547
00:39:31,966 --> 00:39:35,094
Governments are nothing more
than puppets and strings

548
00:39:35,136 --> 00:39:38,639
in a world where NAFTA
can overrule the Supreme Court.

549
00:39:39,724 --> 00:39:40,808
Like my cousin Mashkov

550
00:39:40,891 --> 00:39:43,978
always says: "This
is our only refuge, baby...

551
00:39:44,061 --> 00:39:47,064
gold."

552
00:39:53,154 --> 00:39:56,282
Every time I look
at these engravings...

553
00:39:56,324 --> 00:39:59,118
She's so beautiful.

554
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,287
Where'd you say you got these?

555
00:40:01,329 --> 00:40:02,455
I didn't.

556
00:40:08,836 --> 00:40:10,379
A little walking around money.

557
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,600
I guess I'm not walking
as far as I thought.

558
00:40:22,683 --> 00:40:23,643
I'm... sorry.

559
00:40:23,684 --> 00:40:25,186
I can only buy two bricks
from you today.

560
00:40:25,227 --> 00:40:27,146
- That wasn't the agreement.
- What can I say?

561
00:40:27,188 --> 00:40:28,481
I'm just middleman.

562
00:40:28,522 --> 00:40:30,816
I'll buy the other two
from you on Wednesday.

563
00:40:30,858 --> 00:40:32,360
Don't waste my time, Yevhen.

564
00:40:43,537 --> 00:40:44,497
So, what does a man

565
00:40:44,622 --> 00:40:47,500
with 35 million dollars worth
of gold do at night?

566
00:40:50,211 --> 00:40:52,797
He watches his big-ass TV.

567
00:40:55,216 --> 00:40:57,343
That's our in.

568
00:41:20,074 --> 00:41:20,992
Stella.

569
00:41:21,075 --> 00:41:22,952
Jesus!

570
00:41:23,035 --> 00:41:24,787
Charlie!

571
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:26,289
How did you get in here?

572
00:41:26,372 --> 00:41:27,832
I knocked,
but you didn't answer.

573
00:41:27,915 --> 00:41:30,334
What... so you just
let yourself in?

574
00:41:30,418 --> 00:41:31,627
I was just making sure
you were okay.

575
00:41:31,711 --> 00:41:33,004
I apologize. I just...

576
00:41:34,088 --> 00:41:35,881
- I...
- Don't look.

577
00:41:40,219 --> 00:41:41,554
Okay.

578
00:41:44,557 --> 00:41:45,933
You got a lot of stuff here.

579
00:41:46,017 --> 00:41:48,894
You know,
your dad was old school.

580
00:41:48,978 --> 00:41:50,896
Did the whole thing by touch.

581
00:41:50,938 --> 00:41:52,982
That worked for him;
this works for me.

582
00:41:53,065 --> 00:41:56,027
Technology guarantees speed
and accuracy, you know?

583
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:58,571
Yeah, but there's no guarantees
in this business, Stella.

584
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:02,158
Why the headphones?

585
00:42:02,241 --> 00:42:03,993
Just training myself.

586
00:42:04,076 --> 00:42:06,704
Ambient noises, you know,
just in case.

587
00:42:09,665 --> 00:42:11,375
What do you want, Charlie?

588
00:42:12,668 --> 00:42:14,253
We're going to knock out
Steve's cable,

589
00:42:14,337 --> 00:42:16,005
and we need to send in
a repairman.

590
00:42:16,088 --> 00:42:18,424
To get your video blueprint
of the interior.

591
00:42:18,591 --> 00:42:19,925
Yep.

592
00:42:20,009 --> 00:42:22,720
Only problem is
Steve thinks we're all dead.

593
00:42:25,014 --> 00:42:26,182
Except me.

594
00:42:29,852 --> 00:42:31,020
I'll do it, Charlie.

595
00:42:31,103 --> 00:42:34,523
I'm in all the way,
whatever it takes.

596
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:37,068
All right.

597
00:42:37,151 --> 00:42:38,611
I'll set it up.

598
00:42:38,694 --> 00:42:39,779
Okay.

599
00:42:39,862 --> 00:42:41,364
Um... you, um...

600
00:42:41,447 --> 00:42:43,032
maybe want to get a drink
downstairs with me

601
00:42:43,115 --> 00:42:44,116
before I go back to my room?

602
00:42:46,702 --> 00:42:50,122
I sh... I should finish
this stuff up, you know?

603
00:42:50,206 --> 00:42:52,249
Just get it all done tonight.

604
00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:53,960
Yeah.

605
00:42:54,043 --> 00:42:55,211
Sorry I scared you.

606
00:42:55,294 --> 00:42:57,296
It's okay.

607
00:42:57,296 --> 00:42:57,338
|

608
00:42:57,338 --> 00:42:58,923
Good night.

609
00:43:00,007 --> 00:43:01,801
Bye.

610
00:43:01,884 --> 00:43:04,470
And then he's just...
the media darling.

611
00:43:04,553 --> 00:43:06,138
He's on the cover
of all the magazines.

612
00:43:06,222 --> 00:43:08,432
I should've been on the cover
of Wired Magazine.

613
00:43:08,557 --> 00:43:09,433
You know what he said?

614
00:43:09,558 --> 00:43:10,893
He said he...
he named it Napster

615
00:43:10,977 --> 00:43:12,186
because it-it was his nickname,

616
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:14,272
'cause of the nappy hair
under the hat,

617
00:43:14,355 --> 00:43:16,440
but he... it's 'cause
I was napping

618
00:43:16,524 --> 00:43:18,442
when he stole it from me!

619
00:43:18,567 --> 00:43:21,112
He didn't even graduate.

620
00:43:21,195 --> 00:43:24,115
I think it's time to move on,
don't you?

621
00:43:24,198 --> 00:43:25,116
They shut him down.

622
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:28,160
I wish they'd
do the same to you.

623
00:43:29,203 --> 00:43:30,329
Here... here we go.

624
00:43:30,413 --> 00:43:31,831
Cable chick.

625
00:43:43,384 --> 00:43:44,468
Becky.

626
00:43:44,552 --> 00:43:46,137
Nice name... I wonder
what she calls

627
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:47,138
the other one.

628
00:43:47,221 --> 00:43:48,472
And it's such a mystery

629
00:43:48,556 --> 00:43:50,349
why you don't have
a girlfriend, Lyle.

630
00:43:51,434 --> 00:43:52,977
So, all we need is a...

631
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,312
service truck like that one,

632
00:43:54,395 --> 00:43:56,355
a work shirt like hers.

633
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,774
You think Stella
can pull it off?

634
00:43:58,858 --> 00:44:00,318
I have my doubts.

635
00:44:00,401 --> 00:44:02,528
There's no talking
to Charlie, though.

636
00:44:03,696 --> 00:44:06,490
You think he's...

637
00:44:06,574 --> 00:44:08,993
mixing business with pleasure?

638
00:44:09,076 --> 00:44:11,287
He should know better.

639
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:12,997
Only I'm allowed to do that.

640
00:44:14,832 --> 00:44:17,418
Right. Where you going?

641
00:44:17,543 --> 00:44:19,795
To get a work shirt
and a service truck.

642
00:44:28,679 --> 00:44:30,556
Are you kidding me?

643
00:44:34,685 --> 00:44:36,729
How does he do that?

644
00:44:36,812 --> 00:44:37,772
How do you do that?

645
00:44:37,855 --> 00:44:39,065
What are you saying?

646
00:44:39,148 --> 00:44:40,566
Hey, how are you?

647
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:42,068
Oh, good. I'm good.

648
00:44:42,109 --> 00:44:44,946
Nice to meet you,
I'm... Handsome Rob.

649
00:44:45,029 --> 00:44:46,364
And you are...?

650
00:44:46,447 --> 00:44:47,782
Oh, my name's...
my name's Becky,

651
00:44:47,865 --> 00:44:49,241
but it's written on my shirt.

652
00:44:49,283 --> 00:44:52,286
Listen, I'm going to need
your shirt... and your truck.

653
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:53,871
Perfect.
I'll give them both to you.

654
00:44:53,955 --> 00:44:56,123
Would you... would you like
my virginity as well?

655
00:44:56,207 --> 00:44:57,708
If it's on the menu.

656
00:44:57,792 --> 00:44:59,293
Ha, ha, ha, ha,
oh, you're so witty.

657
00:44:59,377 --> 00:45:01,170
Why don't you
take advantage of me?

658
00:45:01,253 --> 00:45:03,130
Yeah, you're
not too bright, are you?

659
00:45:03,214 --> 00:45:04,131
No.

660
00:45:04,215 --> 00:45:05,424
Perfect.

661
00:46:51,572 --> 00:46:53,282
What can I do for you,
Mr. Frazelli?

662
00:46:53,366 --> 00:46:54,617
The cable's out.

663
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:56,118
The TV, the modem, everything.

664
00:46:56,202 --> 00:46:58,454
Now, get somebody up here,
and tell them to hurry up.

665
00:47:04,251 --> 00:47:06,045
Netcom Cable,
how can I help you?

666
00:47:06,128 --> 00:47:08,547
Hi, I'm up at 3320 East Skyway,
and the cable's

667
00:47:08,589 --> 00:47:10,216
just gone out...
our modem, everything.

668
00:47:10,299 --> 00:47:11,884
Okay, um, let's see, sir.

669
00:47:11,968 --> 00:47:13,970
I have a Thursday
between 9:00 and 3:00

670
00:47:14,053 --> 00:47:15,137
if that would be good.

671
00:47:15,221 --> 00:47:16,722
That's going to work. Thank you.

672
00:47:16,806 --> 00:47:19,433
Guard just called
the cable company.

673
00:47:20,726 --> 00:47:22,853
What time's the appointment?

674
00:47:22,937 --> 00:47:24,855
Thursday between 9:00 and 3:00.

675
00:47:34,156 --> 00:47:35,074
Hello?

676
00:47:35,157 --> 00:47:36,534
Hi, I'm calling
from Netcom Cable.

677
00:47:36,617 --> 00:47:37,910
I understand your service
is out,

678
00:47:37,994 --> 00:47:39,704
and there was an appointment
set up for Thursday.

679
00:47:39,787 --> 00:47:40,705
Yes.

680
00:47:40,788 --> 00:47:42,039
Well, we have
a technician working

681
00:47:42,123 --> 00:47:43,666
in your area who's finished
with an appointment

682
00:47:43,749 --> 00:47:44,667
earlier than expected.

683
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:46,252
Will somebody be there
for the next hour?

684
00:47:46,335 --> 00:47:47,586
Sure, that'd be great.

685
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:50,089
All right, our technician
will see you then.

686
00:47:50,131 --> 00:47:51,132
Have a nice day.

687
00:47:52,508 --> 00:47:54,260
Here's all the paperwork
you need.

688
00:47:54,343 --> 00:47:57,263
Just get him to sign
and date at the bottom.

689
00:47:57,346 --> 00:47:59,807
Let's check out the camera.

690
00:48:02,143 --> 00:48:05,938
Stella,
you'll be going patriotic today.

691
00:48:07,982 --> 00:48:09,358
Make sure you walk slowly,

692
00:48:09,442 --> 00:48:10,860
or the image will streak.

693
00:48:10,943 --> 00:48:11,861
- Ow.
- Ooh.

694
00:48:11,944 --> 00:48:13,404
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

695
00:48:14,697 --> 00:48:16,198
Sorry... Couldn't pin

696
00:48:16,282 --> 00:48:17,742
the corsage
on my prom date either.

697
00:48:17,825 --> 00:48:18,743
But you had a prom date?

698
00:48:18,826 --> 00:48:20,953
It was his cousin.

699
00:48:20,995 --> 00:48:22,538
There's cable lines

700
00:48:22,622 --> 00:48:24,415
in the kitchen,
living room, bedroom,

701
00:48:24,498 --> 00:48:26,292
and the cable modem on
the computer in the office.

702
00:48:26,375 --> 00:48:28,794
You need to locate
the safe in the office.

703
00:48:30,838 --> 00:48:31,881
Okay.

704
00:48:31,964 --> 00:48:33,591
Just want you to know

705
00:48:33,674 --> 00:48:34,800
I think you're very
brave going in there.

706
00:48:34,884 --> 00:48:35,801
I know it won't be easy.

707
00:48:35,885 --> 00:48:37,637
I second that.

708
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,390
It's going to be fine.

709
00:48:42,683 --> 00:48:44,268
What?

710
00:48:44,352 --> 00:48:46,312
You know what fine stands for?

711
00:48:46,395 --> 00:48:47,396
Freaked Out. Insecure...

712
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:50,566
Neurotic, and Emotional.

713
00:48:55,363 --> 00:48:56,572
You'll be great.

714
00:48:56,656 --> 00:48:57,782
Yeah.

715
00:49:09,377 --> 00:49:10,711
Morning.

716
00:49:10,795 --> 00:49:12,004
Can I see some I.D.?

717
00:49:21,514 --> 00:49:23,683
Thanks for coming so soon.

718
00:49:23,766 --> 00:49:25,226
Hey, that's part of the job.

719
00:49:25,309 --> 00:49:26,811
All right.

720
00:49:57,591 --> 00:50:00,052
Aston Martin Vanquish.

721
00:50:00,094 --> 00:50:03,848
Looks like that bastard
took my car.

722
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:09,312
Nasty-ass dogs.

723
00:50:09,395 --> 00:50:12,106
Hey! Hey!

724
00:50:17,987 --> 00:50:19,030
Relax,

725
00:50:19,113 --> 00:50:21,240
Jesus Christ.

726
00:50:21,324 --> 00:50:23,576
Come on,
they won't bother you now.

727
00:50:24,619 --> 00:50:26,746
Come on.

728
00:50:28,331 --> 00:50:29,957
House.

729
00:50:30,041 --> 00:50:32,001
Go on, get out of here.

730
00:50:37,048 --> 00:50:38,132
It's okay,

731
00:50:38,215 --> 00:50:40,885
I'm used to running into
all sorts of animals on my job.

732
00:50:44,305 --> 00:50:45,556
Steve Frazelli.

733
00:50:47,224 --> 00:50:48,601
Becky.

734
00:50:51,687 --> 00:50:53,606
Want to show me that problem?

735
00:50:53,689 --> 00:50:55,316
Yeah, of course.

736
00:50:55,399 --> 00:50:56,609
This way.

737
00:50:57,693 --> 00:50:59,487
You have a really nice house.

738
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:01,822
Yeah. 1922.

739
00:51:01,906 --> 00:51:04,492
All the original tiles.

740
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:06,160
Every stone in that courtyard

741
00:51:06,243 --> 00:51:08,955
hauled from some
monastery in Seville.

742
00:51:09,038 --> 00:51:10,456
What a tactic.

743
00:51:10,498 --> 00:51:11,791
Monastery?

744
00:51:11,874 --> 00:51:14,210
Monastery for punk-ass creeps.

745
00:51:14,293 --> 00:51:16,879
You don't seem impressed.

746
00:51:16,963 --> 00:51:19,298
No, it's just that I don't think
lugging a bunch of rocks

747
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,968
from one place to another
is quite... that interesting.

748
00:51:22,009 --> 00:51:24,303
You know, it doesn't quite
do it for me.

749
00:51:24,345 --> 00:51:26,639
What does do it for you?

750
00:51:26,681 --> 00:51:29,976
Um... TVs?

751
00:51:30,017 --> 00:51:31,769
I have a monster TV.

752
00:51:32,853 --> 00:51:34,021
Not working right now, but...

753
00:51:34,105 --> 00:51:35,815
But you know, I should
probably check out

754
00:51:35,856 --> 00:51:37,441
the cable modem, you know.

755
00:51:37,566 --> 00:51:38,985
Yeah? Yeah, right.

756
00:51:39,026 --> 00:51:40,486
Over here.

757
00:51:42,571 --> 00:51:45,992
I paid 30 grand to some punk kid
to put this system in.

758
00:51:46,033 --> 00:51:47,493
One day, it just goes out.

759
00:51:47,535 --> 00:51:51,163
I ought to have him strung up.

760
00:51:54,041 --> 00:51:54,917
Here we go.

761
00:51:55,001 --> 00:51:55,960
There's our baby.

762
00:51:57,003 --> 00:51:58,462
We got him.

763
00:51:58,546 --> 00:52:00,381
Got any, uh, wiring
coming through here?

764
00:52:00,464 --> 00:52:02,008
There's no wiring in here.

765
00:52:05,219 --> 00:52:06,304
Just right here?

766
00:52:06,387 --> 00:52:07,346
Yeah.

767
00:52:07,388 --> 00:52:09,181
Look at that, that's my...

768
00:52:09,265 --> 00:52:11,100
That's my NAD T770.
That's...

769
00:52:11,183 --> 00:52:13,102
That's my stereo.

770
00:52:13,185 --> 00:52:14,645
I bet most of your customers

771
00:52:14,729 --> 00:52:16,981
are pretty surprised when
they go to open the door

772
00:52:17,064 --> 00:52:18,608
for the cable man
and find you standing there.

773
00:52:18,691 --> 00:52:19,859
Oh, yeah.

774
00:52:19,942 --> 00:52:21,819
He's hitting on her.

775
00:52:21,902 --> 00:52:22,987
There's no problem here.

776
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:24,697
I should maybe
just check the TVs.

777
00:52:26,198 --> 00:52:28,034
Okay.

778
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:32,288
You know what,
end this shit right now.

779
00:52:32,371 --> 00:52:33,289
I'm going to blow this shit

780
00:52:33,372 --> 00:52:34,790
right off the mountain
right now.

781
00:52:34,874 --> 00:52:36,834
No, no, no.
No, no, hey, hey, hey.

782
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:43,257
I see you got the AVM processor.

783
00:52:43,341 --> 00:52:45,134
Only the best.

784
00:52:45,217 --> 00:52:47,178
Check the box.

785
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:55,686
I'm just going to...
reset your system.

786
00:52:55,770 --> 00:52:59,649
Sometimes these things just get
jammed up you know?

787
00:52:59,732 --> 00:53:01,359
That should do it.

788
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:01,442
|

789
00:53:01,442 --> 00:53:03,319
It's fixed?

790
00:53:03,402 --> 00:53:05,821
Turn her on, let's see.

791
00:53:05,905 --> 00:53:06,989
Now.

792
00:53:09,492 --> 00:53:11,035
Japan's Nikkei index...

793
00:53:11,118 --> 00:53:12,578
Perfect.

794
00:53:13,829 --> 00:53:14,914
...was the ending price

795
00:53:14,997 --> 00:53:16,749
and as you can see,
we've now gone below...

796
00:53:16,832 --> 00:53:19,251
Becky, huh?

797
00:53:19,335 --> 00:53:22,254
Have we met before?

798
00:53:22,296 --> 00:53:24,423
...a loss of 1.1 percent
on the...

799
00:53:24,507 --> 00:53:26,258
No, I don't think so.

800
00:53:26,342 --> 00:53:27,760
If you can just sign there.

801
00:53:29,178 --> 00:53:31,180
So, if I was to ask you
out to dinner...

802
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:32,932
would I be the first
one of your customers

803
00:53:32,974 --> 00:53:34,100
to ever do that?

804
00:53:34,183 --> 00:53:37,228
What, you asked your last cable
repair guy out for a date?

805
00:53:37,311 --> 00:53:39,272
No, but the last one
was, like, 300 pounds,

806
00:53:39,355 --> 00:53:40,439
had a handlebar mustache.

807
00:53:40,523 --> 00:53:41,607
You know, not really my type.

808
00:53:41,691 --> 00:53:44,193
I don't think it's a good idea.

809
00:53:44,277 --> 00:53:46,445
Why, is that, like,
some, cable company rule?

810
00:53:46,612 --> 00:53:49,282
No, actually, it's just my rule.

811
00:53:49,365 --> 00:53:51,075
I don't go out
with strange men.

812
00:53:51,158 --> 00:53:54,078
I just met you five minutes ago.

813
00:53:54,161 --> 00:53:56,580
So, I guess I have to, like,
sabotage my cable, you know,

814
00:53:56,664 --> 00:53:58,457
till we get to know each other
well enough.

815
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:02,253
Have a nice day.

816
00:54:02,336 --> 00:54:04,255
Come on,

817
00:54:04,338 --> 00:54:05,715
I'll be a perfect
gentleman, I promise.

818
00:54:05,798 --> 00:54:07,300
I won't even ask you
for your phone number.

819
00:54:07,383 --> 00:54:08,426
I'll just... I'll meet you.

820
00:54:08,509 --> 00:54:10,970
Anywhere you want to go.

821
00:54:11,053 --> 00:54:14,974
Come on, break your rule once.

822
00:54:16,058 --> 00:54:17,810
It's just dinner.

823
00:54:22,857 --> 00:54:25,318
Is that a yes?

824
00:54:35,369 --> 00:54:37,955
Are you okay?

825
00:54:38,039 --> 00:54:40,458
Yeah.

826
00:54:40,541 --> 00:54:42,668
He touched my hand.

827
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:47,506
He came on to me.

828
00:54:50,384 --> 00:54:52,303
Hey, at least I...

829
00:54:52,386 --> 00:54:54,972
I created a window
of opportunity, right?

830
00:54:57,058 --> 00:54:59,810
When he goes out Friday night,
we go in.

831
00:54:59,894 --> 00:55:01,646
By the time he realizes
you've stood him up,

832
00:55:01,687 --> 00:55:03,481
we'll be long gone
with that gold.

833
00:55:03,564 --> 00:55:05,358
Yeah.

834
00:55:06,567 --> 00:55:09,070
Make sure you shuffle
them cards this time, Left.

835
00:55:09,153 --> 00:55:11,072
Hey, Lyle,

836
00:55:11,155 --> 00:55:13,407
what's the distance between
the front door and the vault?

837
00:55:13,491 --> 00:55:14,742
Don't deal
when my back's turned.

838
00:55:14,825 --> 00:55:17,244
You've got that loser's
paranoia.

839
00:55:17,328 --> 00:55:18,537
Lyle!

840
00:55:18,579 --> 00:55:20,831
He only answers
to The Napster now, Charlie.

841
00:55:20,915 --> 00:55:22,083
No.

842
00:55:22,166 --> 00:55:24,293
I'm not calling you The Napster.

843
00:55:24,377 --> 00:55:25,586
Why not, you call him Left Ear.

844
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:26,587
Well, I am.

845
00:55:26,671 --> 00:55:28,547
And him, Handsome Rob.

846
00:55:28,631 --> 00:55:30,174
Well, that's because
he is Handsome Rob.

847
00:55:30,257 --> 00:55:32,718
Well, you can call me
The Napster.

848
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,262
Come on, they were at the
same college at the same time.

849
00:55:35,346 --> 00:55:37,515
Why are you encouraging this?

850
00:55:37,598 --> 00:55:39,350
It is a verifiable fact...

851
00:55:39,433 --> 00:55:41,811
he was my roommate,
he stole my ideas.

852
00:55:41,894 --> 00:55:43,646
I am The Napster.

853
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:47,566
All right, all right.

854
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:48,818
What is the distance

855
00:55:48,901 --> 00:55:51,737
between the front door
and the vault, Napster?

856
00:55:53,489 --> 00:55:55,866
It's farther
than you want to carry it.

857
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:57,952
Yeah, but, so,
how do we get the gold

858
00:55:57,994 --> 00:55:59,829
from the vault
to the getaway car?

859
00:55:59,912 --> 00:56:02,456
How wide is the hallway...
Napster?

860
00:56:07,628 --> 00:56:09,171
Six feet.

861
00:56:26,772 --> 00:56:28,316
Okay, you've got your gold.

862
00:56:49,962 --> 00:56:51,130
Whoo!

863
00:57:28,292 --> 00:57:30,336
We need more cars
to handle the weight.

864
00:57:30,419 --> 00:57:32,713
Looks like I'm going to need
some help

865
00:57:32,755 --> 00:57:34,715
with the custom work, too.

866
00:57:34,757 --> 00:57:36,092
I know a man for the job.

867
00:57:36,175 --> 00:57:39,136
So I modified the camera
to include the...

868
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:41,973
so we can create really
hi-res digital maps.

869
00:57:42,056 --> 00:57:43,099
Who's that?

870
00:57:43,182 --> 00:57:45,059
Rob's mechanic friend.

871
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:50,982
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey.

872
00:57:51,065 --> 00:57:52,733
Charlie, this is Wrench.

873
00:57:52,775 --> 00:57:54,277
Hey, what's up, man?

874
00:57:54,318 --> 00:57:56,028
Rob tells me you
got real talent.

875
00:57:56,112 --> 00:57:57,571
We need some body work done.

876
00:57:57,613 --> 00:58:02,034
Need to pack up to 2,700 pounds
of cargo in these Minis

877
00:58:02,118 --> 00:58:03,411
with enough suspension
and horsepower

878
00:58:03,452 --> 00:58:05,496
to outrun anything chasing us.

879
00:58:05,579 --> 00:58:07,331
2,700 pounds of what?

880
00:58:07,415 --> 00:58:09,625
Of whatever.

881
00:58:11,752 --> 00:58:13,796
So, what do I get out
of this mystery deal, man?

882
00:58:13,879 --> 00:58:15,298
10,000.

883
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:18,968
All right.

884
00:58:29,478 --> 00:58:31,439
What comes around...

885
00:58:45,036 --> 00:58:47,371
Oh, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey.

886
00:58:47,455 --> 00:58:49,332
We didn't get a chance
to meet yet.

887
00:58:49,373 --> 00:58:50,916
Wrench.

888
00:58:52,126 --> 00:58:53,878
Ham and cheese.

889
00:58:53,961 --> 00:58:55,630
Oh. Oh, that's cold.

890
00:58:55,671 --> 00:58:57,798
Damn, that's cold. Mmm.

891
00:59:00,801 --> 00:59:01,969
What comes around

892
00:59:04,013 --> 00:59:06,515
Just comes around

893
00:59:22,281 --> 00:59:23,199
What comes around

894
00:59:26,661 --> 00:59:27,536
What comes around...

895
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:44,512
You want all greens?

896
00:59:44,595 --> 00:59:45,930
'Cause, ah, 'cause you got them.

897
00:59:47,014 --> 00:59:48,057
What have you got?

898
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:50,476
Welcome to L.A. 's
Automated Traffic Surveillance

899
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:52,645
and Control Operations Center.

900
00:59:52,728 --> 00:59:54,480
See, they use video feeds
from intersections

901
00:59:54,563 --> 00:59:55,773
and specifically designed
algorithms

902
00:59:55,856 --> 00:59:57,525
to predict traffic conditions,

903
00:59:57,566 --> 00:59:59,235
and thereby control
traffic lights, so

904
00:59:59,318 --> 01:00:01,237
all I did was come up
with my own

905
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:03,698
kick-ass algorithm to sneak in,

906
01:00:03,781 --> 01:00:05,491
and now we own the place.

907
01:00:05,574 --> 01:00:06,534
You want to do a dry run?

908
01:00:06,575 --> 01:00:08,286
I thought you'd never ask.

909
01:00:10,413 --> 01:00:11,372
See, red light?

910
01:00:11,414 --> 01:00:12,415
Green light.

911
01:00:18,004 --> 01:00:19,005
- Danielson?
- Yeah?

912
01:00:19,088 --> 01:00:20,089
What's up with Grid 34?

913
01:00:20,172 --> 01:00:22,091
Let's check it out.

914
01:00:22,133 --> 01:00:23,551
Hey, hey.

915
01:00:23,592 --> 01:00:25,428
Oh, oops, did I...?

916
01:00:25,511 --> 01:00:27,972
Oops, wow, but it's awesome.
Is that not awesome?

917
01:00:28,055 --> 01:00:29,932
- Can you change it back now?
- Yeah.

918
01:00:35,688 --> 01:00:36,606
Lights are working fine.

919
01:00:36,689 --> 01:00:38,983
Just an accident.

920
01:00:40,276 --> 01:00:41,277
That's good.

921
01:00:42,778 --> 01:00:44,488
What are those?

922
01:00:44,572 --> 01:00:46,407
Unnecessary engine parts.

923
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:50,202
I lost your smog controls,
and 200 pounds of body fat.

924
01:00:50,286 --> 01:00:53,122
You got yourself
a sweet ride now, Charlie.

925
01:00:53,205 --> 01:00:54,290
Put the pedal to the metal
and I'm off

926
01:00:54,457 --> 01:00:55,541
And never getting lost

927
01:00:55,625 --> 01:00:57,084
Which way will I turn
when roads cross?

928
01:00:57,126 --> 01:00:58,836
Press the petal to the metal,
little more when it's scary

929
01:00:58,919 --> 01:01:00,838
But one thing for sure,
keep my foot on the floor

930
01:01:00,921 --> 01:01:02,131
Put the pedal to the metal
and I'm off

931
01:01:02,214 --> 01:01:03,841
And never getting lost

932
01:01:03,924 --> 01:01:05,551
Which way will I turn
when roads cross?

933
01:01:05,635 --> 01:01:07,762
Press the petal to the metal,
little more when it's scary

934
01:01:07,803 --> 01:01:10,181
But one thing for sure,
keep my foot on the floor

935
01:01:10,264 --> 01:01:12,808
Won't stop driving
till it's over

936
01:01:14,268 --> 01:01:18,981
Still be cruising
when the sun goes down

937
01:01:19,065 --> 01:01:21,484
Won't stop driving
till it's over

938
01:01:21,567 --> 01:01:23,277
Put the pedal to the metal
and I'm off

939
01:01:23,319 --> 01:01:24,654
And never getting lost

940
01:01:24,737 --> 01:01:26,238
Which way will I turn
when roads cross?

941
01:01:26,364 --> 01:01:28,783
Press the petal to the metal,
little more when it's scary

942
01:01:28,824 --> 01:01:31,619
But one thing for sure,
keep my foot on the floor...

943
01:01:35,456 --> 01:01:38,292
You know what
I'm thinking about right now?

944
01:01:38,376 --> 01:01:40,670
The look on Steve's face.

945
01:01:51,639 --> 01:01:52,556
You're early.

946
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,266
I'm in a hurry.

947
01:01:57,353 --> 01:01:58,396
Of course, you know
that the Florida

948
01:01:58,479 --> 01:02:00,648
vote rigging was a CIA
and mob operation.

949
01:02:00,731 --> 01:02:01,649
Is that so?

950
01:02:01,732 --> 01:02:02,984
Yeah, which is not
so very different

951
01:02:03,025 --> 01:02:04,235
from when your John F. Kennedy

952
01:02:04,318 --> 01:02:06,988
won a rigged election
with the help of his father.

953
01:02:07,071 --> 01:02:08,614
You're uncomfortable
that I mentioned it.

954
01:02:08,698 --> 01:02:11,200
No, Yevhen, I don't like
making two trips.

955
01:02:11,284 --> 01:02:13,119
You Americans.

956
01:02:13,202 --> 01:02:14,870
You love your heroes.

957
01:02:14,954 --> 01:02:17,832
A holiday for Columbus?

958
01:02:17,873 --> 01:02:19,750
He makes the wrong turn,

959
01:02:19,834 --> 01:02:22,253
and wipes out an entire
indigenous people.

960
01:02:22,378 --> 01:02:23,546
And you know
what he was looking for?

961
01:02:23,629 --> 01:02:25,256
I bet you're going to tell me.

962
01:02:25,381 --> 01:02:26,424
Gold.

963
01:02:26,507 --> 01:02:28,259
Supposedly for Queen Isabella,

964
01:02:28,384 --> 01:02:30,136
but don't think that
the Medicis back in Italy

965
01:02:30,219 --> 01:02:31,679
didn't want a part
of that action.

966
01:02:31,762 --> 01:02:34,015
And what did Italy
need gold for?

967
01:02:34,056 --> 01:02:38,394
For the long-distance
slave trade based in Venice.

968
01:02:38,477 --> 01:02:39,729
Venice...
that's where

969
01:02:39,812 --> 01:02:41,731
these bricks...

970
01:02:46,986 --> 01:02:47,987
You were saying something?

971
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:49,572
Nothing... No...

972
01:02:49,655 --> 01:02:50,781
No, you were really
on a roll there.

973
01:02:50,865 --> 01:02:52,199
Don't stop. I'm interested.

974
01:02:52,283 --> 01:02:54,201
Please, I'm confused,
my English...

975
01:02:56,579 --> 01:02:57,496
You understand fine.

976
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:58,789
Now what do you know
about my gold?

977
01:02:58,873 --> 01:02:59,790
No, I don't...

978
01:02:59,874 --> 01:03:01,959
Don't you even think
about lying to me.

979
01:03:02,043 --> 01:03:05,004
Okay,
okay, l, I heard a rumor

980
01:03:05,087 --> 01:03:07,590
about a heist in Venice.

981
01:03:07,673 --> 01:03:09,925
35 million in bricks,

982
01:03:10,009 --> 01:03:12,345
with an imprint
of a Balinese dancer on them.

983
01:03:12,428 --> 01:03:13,888
- Who have you told?
- No one.

984
01:03:13,971 --> 01:03:14,889
Who have you told?

985
01:03:14,972 --> 01:03:16,932
No one!
I swear to God!

986
01:03:18,935 --> 01:03:20,061
You swear to God?

987
01:03:20,144 --> 01:03:22,563
You crazy?
I swear to God.

988
01:03:22,647 --> 01:03:23,606
I didn't!

989
01:03:25,149 --> 01:03:26,400
Well, then I guess
I believe you.

990
01:03:56,347 --> 01:03:57,765
Yevhen?

991
01:03:59,976 --> 01:04:01,477
Yevhen?

992
01:04:18,494 --> 01:04:19,662
Let's putt it this time...

993
01:04:20,830 --> 01:04:22,999
Putt, not drive.

994
01:04:23,082 --> 01:04:24,375
Very good.

995
01:04:24,458 --> 01:04:25,710
If you can just get it,

996
01:04:25,793 --> 01:04:27,712
I know you can,
I know you can do it.

997
01:04:27,795 --> 01:04:29,046
Much better.

998
01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:31,132
I'm here to see Skinny Pete.

999
01:04:31,215 --> 01:04:32,466
Yeah, he's over there.

1000
01:04:32,550 --> 01:04:34,093
Thanks, man.

1001
01:04:36,637 --> 01:04:38,014
- Don't stare.
- Huh?

1002
01:04:38,097 --> 01:04:39,140
Don't stare.

1003
01:04:39,223 --> 01:04:40,558
He doesn't like
when people stare at him.

1004
01:04:40,641 --> 01:04:41,600
Stare at what?

1005
01:04:42,935 --> 01:04:44,186
That was good.
That was good.

1006
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:45,855
Try that one, I know
you're going to get that one.

1007
01:04:47,148 --> 01:04:49,275
That was great.

1008
01:04:49,358 --> 01:04:51,027
- Skinny Pete.
- Yo, Charlie.

1009
01:04:51,110 --> 01:04:52,278
What's up, man?

1010
01:04:52,403 --> 01:04:53,654
How's it going?

1011
01:04:53,738 --> 01:04:56,282
So was I right
about the gold bricks or what?

1012
01:04:56,365 --> 01:04:58,242
Oh, I'm not here to talk
about that. We need, uh...

1013
01:04:58,326 --> 01:05:00,578
some supplies.

1014
01:05:00,661 --> 01:05:01,579
Baby, go relax.

1015
01:05:01,662 --> 01:05:02,580
Baby...

1016
01:05:02,663 --> 01:05:03,998
Go relax.

1017
01:05:10,004 --> 01:05:11,088
Yo.

1018
01:05:11,172 --> 01:05:13,132
Yo.

1019
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:14,842
Supplies.

1020
01:05:14,884 --> 01:05:15,718
What's wrong?

1021
01:05:15,801 --> 01:05:16,886
Huh?

1022
01:05:16,969 --> 01:05:19,597
Uh... um, some, uh,

1023
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:20,806
some nitromin,

1024
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:22,516
uh...

1025
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,018
some, uh...

1026
01:05:24,101 --> 01:05:26,354
some nitromin, primer...

1027
01:05:26,395 --> 01:05:27,772
- What's wrong?
- Huh?

1028
01:05:27,855 --> 01:05:28,230
Yo.

1029
01:05:28,314 --> 01:05:29,398
Uh, nothing.

1030
01:05:29,482 --> 01:05:30,399
I'm-I'm cool. I'm-I'm great.

1031
01:05:30,483 --> 01:05:32,109
Uh, I just need some,
uh, big can of...

1032
01:05:32,193 --> 01:05:34,111
Nitromin, primer,

1033
01:05:34,195 --> 01:05:35,446
- Detonating cord...
- Right, right.

1034
01:05:35,529 --> 01:05:37,573
...two triple-charged chemical
grenades and a launcher.

1035
01:05:37,657 --> 01:05:40,409
Right, like I had, uh,
you know, told you... earlier.

1036
01:05:40,493 --> 01:05:42,203
All right.

1037
01:05:48,084 --> 01:05:49,794
Cost you about five G's.

1038
01:05:49,877 --> 01:05:51,837
Done. Call me.

1039
01:05:53,089 --> 01:05:54,548
Thanks, man.
I'm sorry about that.

1040
01:05:54,632 --> 01:05:56,425
Uh-Uh, all right, man.

1041
01:05:56,509 --> 01:05:58,302
- Peace.
- Come on.

1042
01:06:15,945 --> 01:06:17,738
Get out.

1043
01:06:18,406 --> 01:06:19,573
There.

1044
01:06:28,833 --> 01:06:30,584
Vance has something
to tell you.

1045
01:06:33,963 --> 01:06:35,089
Go on.

1046
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,468
A couple weeks back...

1047
01:06:41,095 --> 01:06:43,723
I was working counter
at your cousin's shop.

1048
01:06:43,806 --> 01:06:46,475
A guy come in asking
about gold bricks with Balinese

1049
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:48,352
dancer on them.

1050
01:06:48,436 --> 01:06:49,854
What did you tell him?

1051
01:06:51,731 --> 01:06:53,941
I told him
that I'd seen some bricks.

1052
01:06:58,988 --> 01:07:01,032
I'm sorry.

1053
01:07:02,325 --> 01:07:04,827
What did this man look like?

1054
01:07:06,078 --> 01:07:07,038
He had, uh...

1055
01:07:07,121 --> 01:07:08,456
long black hair,

1056
01:07:08,539 --> 01:07:10,541
big tattoo on his neck.

1057
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:16,130
He must have weighed
at least 400 pounds.

1058
01:07:16,213 --> 01:07:17,506
I know that guy.

1059
01:07:45,993 --> 01:07:47,662
Baby, go relax.

1060
01:07:58,839 --> 01:08:00,383
Do you know who I am?

1061
01:08:01,467 --> 01:08:02,927
You're Mashkov.

1062
01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:04,887
That's right.

1063
01:08:04,971 --> 01:08:07,598
You were asking
about gold bricks

1064
01:08:07,682 --> 01:08:09,350
with a Balinese dancer
on them.

1065
01:08:10,393 --> 01:08:11,852
Tell me why.

1066
01:08:19,151 --> 01:08:20,528
Steve just called to confirm

1067
01:08:20,569 --> 01:08:22,571
his 8:00 reservation
at the Water Grill.

1068
01:08:22,613 --> 01:08:23,990
Okay, let's go over it
one more time.

1069
01:08:24,073 --> 01:08:26,826
Gas the guards,
doors open 8:15.

1070
01:08:26,909 --> 01:08:28,869
Safe popped by 8:25.

1071
01:08:28,911 --> 01:08:31,330
Loaded by 8:35,
out the door by 8:45.

1072
01:08:31,414 --> 01:08:32,915
Straight to Union Station.

1073
01:08:32,999 --> 01:08:34,333
Only green lights on your route.

1074
01:08:34,417 --> 01:08:35,543
The rest of the city's red.

1075
01:08:35,626 --> 01:08:37,211
Cops are stuck in the traffic,
like everyone else.

1076
01:08:37,336 --> 01:08:38,337
Train leaves at 10:00.

1077
01:08:38,421 --> 01:08:40,631
Cars have to be
on the carrier by 9:30.

1078
01:08:40,715 --> 01:08:42,675
Timing's got to be dead on.

1079
01:08:42,758 --> 01:08:44,051
Let's get ready.

1080
01:08:44,093 --> 01:08:45,553
Let's get it.

1081
01:09:16,542 --> 01:09:19,211
Wow, that is a nice car.

1082
01:09:19,337 --> 01:09:21,005
Sorry, Rob.

1083
01:09:21,088 --> 01:09:22,256
Coast is clear, guys.

1084
01:09:34,143 --> 01:09:35,102
This is it, guys.

1085
01:09:35,144 --> 01:09:36,145
Moment of truth.

1086
01:09:37,813 --> 01:09:38,940
What the hell is this?

1087
01:09:41,275 --> 01:09:43,110
Shit!

1088
01:09:43,194 --> 01:09:45,196
Steve's neighbor's
throwing a party.

1089
01:09:48,616 --> 01:09:50,201
Are you here
for the, uh, Baker party, sir?

1090
01:09:50,284 --> 01:09:52,078
No.

1091
01:09:54,580 --> 01:09:56,499
We're not blowing
any gates tonight, guys.

1092
01:09:56,582 --> 01:09:58,250
Too many witnesses.

1093
01:09:58,334 --> 01:09:59,377
Stella.

1094
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:02,129
I know, I know.

1095
01:10:03,923 --> 01:10:05,800
I'm late for my date.

1096
01:10:05,883 --> 01:10:08,552
Yeah, and you got to be
charming.

1097
01:10:08,636 --> 01:10:10,262
You'll need him
to ask you out again.

1098
01:10:10,346 --> 01:10:11,639
Sorry.

1099
01:10:11,681 --> 01:10:14,308
Let's get out of the street.

1100
01:10:18,187 --> 01:10:20,189
I really can't imagine
you doing that.

1101
01:10:20,273 --> 01:10:21,983
What's that supposed to mean?

1102
01:10:22,024 --> 01:10:23,609
Well, you don't really seem

1103
01:10:23,693 --> 01:10:27,446
like the adventurous type,
you know?

1104
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:30,825
Don't let the cable uniform,
you know, throw you.

1105
01:10:30,866 --> 01:10:33,995
I wasn't making assumptions.

1106
01:10:34,078 --> 01:10:35,496
I've made some
assumptions about you.

1107
01:10:35,538 --> 01:10:38,249
Oh, really?

1108
01:10:38,332 --> 01:10:39,375
And?

1109
01:10:42,628 --> 01:10:44,630
Well... you're just going
to have to wait and see.

1110
01:10:50,594 --> 01:10:52,805
Why wait?
Let's get a check.

1111
01:10:52,888 --> 01:10:54,056
Let's go back to my place.

1112
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:55,099
No assumptions...

1113
01:10:55,182 --> 01:10:56,684
Not tonight.
It's late.

1114
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:57,727
I should go home.

1115
01:10:57,810 --> 01:11:00,813
What, you have
a cable company curfew?

1116
01:11:00,896 --> 01:11:01,897
No,

1117
01:11:01,939 --> 01:11:05,318
but I've made some
bad calls in the past.

1118
01:11:05,401 --> 01:11:06,569
Hey.

1119
01:11:06,652 --> 01:11:08,863
We should take this maybe a
little slower, you know?

1120
01:11:08,904 --> 01:11:11,657
This lovely dinner,
sparkling conversation...

1121
01:11:11,741 --> 01:11:12,742
you still don't trust me?

1122
01:11:12,825 --> 01:11:16,579
Oh, I trust everyone.

1123
01:11:16,662 --> 01:11:19,957
It's the devil inside them
I don't trust.

1124
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:26,213
It's an interesting saying.

1125
01:11:26,255 --> 01:11:27,632
It's charming.
Where'd you pick that up?

1126
01:11:29,175 --> 01:11:30,092
Can't remember.

1127
01:11:30,176 --> 01:11:31,677
Really?

1128
01:11:31,761 --> 01:11:33,929
I knew a guy who said it
exactly like that.

1129
01:11:34,013 --> 01:11:35,097
Really?

1130
01:11:35,181 --> 01:11:37,558
Yeah. He's the only person
I've ever heard say that.

1131
01:11:37,642 --> 01:11:39,644
He said it all the time.

1132
01:11:39,727 --> 01:11:40,853
His name was John Bridger.

1133
01:11:42,229 --> 01:11:44,565
You're hurting my wrist.

1134
01:11:44,607 --> 01:11:46,984
He had a daughter
and she was about your age.

1135
01:11:50,696 --> 01:11:53,157
Let go of my wrist.

1136
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:55,159
I knew that there was
something familiar about you.

1137
01:11:55,242 --> 01:11:58,412
You're exactly like
your old man, you know that?

1138
01:11:58,454 --> 01:12:01,123
I liked him, too,
right from the start.

1139
01:12:01,207 --> 01:12:03,084
I liked him right up
until the minute I shot him.

1140
01:12:05,795 --> 01:12:08,005
Who are you working with?

1141
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:14,428
She's with us.

1142
01:12:26,190 --> 01:12:27,441
Gang's all here.

1143
01:12:27,483 --> 01:12:30,278
You know, the only thing
worse than a thief, Bendel?

1144
01:12:30,319 --> 01:12:31,904
A coward.

1145
01:12:31,988 --> 01:12:32,989
Then you should have seen

1146
01:12:33,072 --> 01:12:34,740
the way your daddy
begged for his life.

1147
01:12:38,369 --> 01:12:39,370
It's not worth it.

1148
01:12:39,453 --> 01:12:40,538
Put a leash on your cat.

1149
01:12:46,168 --> 01:12:47,128
Hi, Steve.

1150
01:12:47,211 --> 01:12:48,462
Charlie.

1151
01:12:50,256 --> 01:12:52,133
Not bad, Charlie.

1152
01:12:52,174 --> 01:12:53,175
Really, not bad.

1153
01:12:53,259 --> 01:12:55,386
You have no idea
how hard it is for me

1154
01:12:55,469 --> 01:12:57,179
not to reach across
this table and kill you

1155
01:12:57,263 --> 01:12:58,639
with my bare hands.

1156
01:12:58,681 --> 01:13:00,141
You know better than that,
Charlie.

1157
01:13:00,224 --> 01:13:02,727
Can't let emotion
into these things.

1158
01:13:02,810 --> 01:13:03,894
Tell me it wasn't about emotion

1159
01:13:03,978 --> 01:13:05,646
when you shot John
and left us all for dead.

1160
01:13:05,688 --> 01:13:07,440
That wasn't about emotion.

1161
01:13:07,523 --> 01:13:09,734
It was about a lot of gold,
and I wanted it.

1162
01:13:09,817 --> 01:13:11,652
Anything you think you
deserved, you didn't.

1163
01:13:11,736 --> 01:13:14,238
Hey, don't talk about right
and wrong with me, man,

1164
01:13:14,363 --> 01:13:15,906
'cause I just don't give a shit.

1165
01:13:15,990 --> 01:13:17,450
Okay?

1166
01:13:17,533 --> 01:13:20,161
You got your cards,
I got my cards,

1167
01:13:20,244 --> 01:13:22,705
we made our play,
and I came out on top, okay?

1168
01:13:22,788 --> 01:13:24,498
Now if you want to start
the game up again,

1169
01:13:24,582 --> 01:13:26,334
that's fine with me.

1170
01:13:26,417 --> 01:13:30,671
But what, I mean, what
is your play here, really?

1171
01:13:30,713 --> 01:13:32,632
I mean, come on, what do you...
what do you think?

1172
01:13:32,715 --> 01:13:35,635
Y-you'll try to take out
my guards, right?

1173
01:13:35,718 --> 01:13:38,638
I have five of them
that you don't know about.

1174
01:13:38,721 --> 01:13:41,015
You'll try to have
Lyle hack the system.

1175
01:13:41,057 --> 01:13:42,350
I'll change it again
tomorrow morning.

1176
01:13:42,433 --> 01:13:45,269
What, what, what was
y-your final move?

1177
01:13:45,394 --> 01:13:47,188
I mean, you were going
to have Bridger's daughter

1178
01:13:47,271 --> 01:13:49,231
come in and try
to crack my safe?

1179
01:13:49,315 --> 01:13:52,652
I mean, that's...
that's very poetic and all,

1180
01:13:52,735 --> 01:13:54,278
but I just don't see it.

1181
01:13:54,362 --> 01:13:55,696
I don't think she'll get
anywhere near it.

1182
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:57,448
Same old Steve, huh?

1183
01:13:57,531 --> 01:13:59,867
Always thinking defensively.

1184
01:13:59,909 --> 01:14:01,619
That's why you're
always number two.

1185
01:14:01,702 --> 01:14:03,746
How do you figure that?

1186
01:14:03,829 --> 01:14:05,289
You got no imagination.

1187
01:14:05,373 --> 01:14:07,708
Couldn't even decide what
to do with all that money.

1188
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:09,794
You had to buy what
everybody else wanted.

1189
01:14:09,877 --> 01:14:12,213
Oh... well, try this on
in your imagination, okay?

1190
01:14:12,296 --> 01:14:13,381
That gold is already gone.

1191
01:14:13,464 --> 01:14:15,132
That's bullshit, Steve.

1192
01:14:15,216 --> 01:14:17,134
No, really, it's over Charlie.

1193
01:14:17,218 --> 01:14:19,136
I'm trying to move
the last two bricks.

1194
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:21,806
You want to come after me
over a couple of lousy bricks?

1195
01:14:21,889 --> 01:14:23,933
I mean, really, be my guest.

1196
01:14:24,016 --> 01:14:25,726
But you're off to a bad start,
you know?

1197
01:14:25,810 --> 01:14:26,936
'Cause you just blew
the best thing

1198
01:14:27,019 --> 01:14:27,937
you had going for you.

1199
01:14:28,020 --> 01:14:30,064
You just blew the element
of surprise.

1200
01:14:34,026 --> 01:14:35,319
Surprised?

1201
01:14:38,698 --> 01:14:39,740
It's over when I say it's over.

1202
01:14:43,744 --> 01:14:45,746
Are you all right, sir?

1203
01:15:17,612 --> 01:15:18,696
How you doing?

1204
01:15:20,906 --> 01:15:23,659
Good...

1205
01:15:23,743 --> 01:15:26,454
considering...

1206
01:15:26,537 --> 01:15:28,914
considering the fact
that I'm doing all of this

1207
01:15:28,998 --> 01:15:30,249
for a man I barely knew.

1208
01:15:37,506 --> 01:15:42,595
You know what bothered me
all those years, Charlie?

1209
01:15:42,678 --> 01:15:46,098
It was that, whenever
he'd call me to tell me

1210
01:15:46,182 --> 01:15:48,142
that he was on some job,

1211
01:15:48,184 --> 01:15:51,771
I knew you were right there
with him.

1212
01:15:54,941 --> 01:15:57,610
You got to know him
a lot better than I did.

1213
01:15:59,695 --> 01:16:01,489
Just 'cause he was around
me more doesn't mean

1214
01:16:01,530 --> 01:16:03,199
he wasn't thinking
about you all the time.

1215
01:16:03,282 --> 01:16:05,660
Be nice if it was true.

1216
01:16:05,701 --> 01:16:06,994
It is true.

1217
01:16:07,036 --> 01:16:08,955
He always regretted
not having been

1218
01:16:09,038 --> 01:16:10,998
a good enough father
to you, Stella.

1219
01:16:13,876 --> 01:16:15,336
How do you know that?

1220
01:16:15,378 --> 01:16:17,797
Because he told me.

1221
01:16:24,470 --> 01:16:25,680
What did you do to your hand?

1222
01:16:30,059 --> 01:16:31,018
I punched Steve.

1223
01:16:31,102 --> 01:16:34,355
Why do you get to punch him
and I don't?

1224
01:16:37,441 --> 01:16:38,818
Those hands are
way too valuable.

1225
01:16:46,784 --> 01:16:48,160
Hey.

1226
01:16:53,749 --> 01:16:55,626
Okay?

1227
01:17:04,343 --> 01:17:05,970
There'll be nothing left
of that if you keep rubbing it.

1228
01:17:12,476 --> 01:17:15,479
Tell Mr. Frazelli
we'll see him at 8:00.

1229
01:17:15,563 --> 01:17:16,731
Charlie!

1230
01:17:19,442 --> 01:17:20,484
He's flying the coop.

1231
01:17:21,777 --> 01:17:22,945
When?

1232
01:17:23,029 --> 01:17:24,488
His security guard called

1233
01:17:24,572 --> 01:17:26,741
for a private helicopter
at 4:00 PM.

1234
01:17:26,782 --> 01:17:29,410
There's an armored car service
coming to his house at 5:00.

1235
01:17:29,452 --> 01:17:33,247
There is a cargo plane scheduled
to depart LAX at 8:00 PM

1236
01:17:33,289 --> 01:17:34,248
to Mexico City.

1237
01:17:34,290 --> 01:17:37,752
What if he's moving the safe
as a diversion?

1238
01:17:37,793 --> 01:17:39,503
We crack it, it's empty,
the gold's somewhere else.

1239
01:17:39,587 --> 01:17:41,631
Steve's not about to let
that gold out of his sight.

1240
01:17:41,714 --> 01:17:42,840
It's going to be in that truck

1241
01:17:42,923 --> 01:17:44,133
and he's going to be watching it

1242
01:17:44,216 --> 01:17:45,926
every step of the way
from the helicopter.

1243
01:17:45,968 --> 01:17:47,720
So the gold's headed to Mexico.

1244
01:17:47,803 --> 01:17:48,763
Who knows where?

1245
01:17:48,804 --> 01:17:49,889
They could change
the flight plan in midair.

1246
01:17:49,972 --> 01:17:50,931
Slow down, slow down.

1247
01:17:50,973 --> 01:17:51,849
You guys are looking at this
the wrong way.

1248
01:17:51,932 --> 01:17:52,933
This is good news for us.

1249
01:17:53,017 --> 01:17:55,269
Charlie, what do you
mean, "good news"?

1250
01:17:55,353 --> 01:17:57,146
We've been trying to get
to the gold in the safe,

1251
01:17:57,229 --> 01:17:58,439
now the safe is coming to us.

1252
01:17:58,481 --> 01:17:59,815
We're going to boost it
in transit.

1253
01:17:59,899 --> 01:18:00,816
Charlie, it could take

1254
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:02,026
a dozen different routes
to the airport.

1255
01:18:02,109 --> 01:18:03,778
We have no idea which one.

1256
01:18:03,861 --> 01:18:06,113
We can't take out an armored
truck during rush hour.

1257
01:18:06,155 --> 01:18:07,156
We're already set up to do it.

1258
01:18:07,198 --> 01:18:08,616
Napster,

1259
01:18:08,658 --> 01:18:12,703
gridlock every route
except for the one we choose.

1260
01:18:12,787 --> 01:18:14,956
Force that truck to go
exactly where we want it to go.

1261
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:16,207
Where do we want it to go?

1262
01:18:16,332 --> 01:18:18,834
We can't have a shoot-out
with armed guards. We'd lose.

1263
01:18:18,918 --> 01:18:21,295
We do it like the Italian job.

1264
01:18:27,510 --> 01:18:28,511
Hello?

1265
01:18:28,594 --> 01:18:29,845
Why'd you do it?

1266
01:18:29,929 --> 01:18:30,763
Do what?

1267
01:18:30,846 --> 01:18:31,555
Yevhen.

1268
01:18:31,639 --> 01:18:33,307
You didn't have to clip him.

1269
01:18:33,391 --> 01:18:34,350
Whoa, whoa.
What are you talking about?

1270
01:18:34,433 --> 01:18:35,351
We didn't clip anybody.

1271
01:18:35,434 --> 01:18:36,435
Yevhen's cousin is under

1272
01:18:36,519 --> 01:18:39,188
the distinct impression
that you did.

1273
01:18:39,272 --> 01:18:40,314
Why does he think that?

1274
01:18:40,398 --> 01:18:41,565
Because you want to know

1275
01:18:41,649 --> 01:18:43,567
about the gold
with the Balinese dancer.

1276
01:18:43,651 --> 01:18:44,902
You told him that?

1277
01:18:44,986 --> 01:18:46,237
Listen to me, man.

1278
01:18:46,362 --> 01:18:48,155
If there's one thing that I know

1279
01:18:48,197 --> 01:18:50,199
is never to mess
with Mother Nature,

1280
01:18:50,241 --> 01:18:52,785
mother-in-laws
or mother-freakin' Ukrainians.

1281
01:18:52,868 --> 01:18:56,455
Look, I need a favor.

1282
01:19:22,481 --> 01:19:23,524
Yeah.

1283
01:19:23,608 --> 01:19:24,692
Had a hiccup last night.

1284
01:19:24,775 --> 01:19:25,693
Could use some help.

1285
01:19:25,776 --> 01:19:26,861
Want hands-on this time.

1286
01:19:26,944 --> 01:19:28,195
You interested?

1287
01:19:28,279 --> 01:19:29,196
Could be.

1288
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,532
But I don't like
to be kept in the dark.

1289
01:19:31,574 --> 01:19:33,951
If I'm in, I'm in.

1290
01:19:34,035 --> 01:19:36,203
Okay, you're in.

1291
01:19:36,245 --> 01:19:37,496
All right.

1292
01:19:40,291 --> 01:19:41,709
What do you think, Charlie?

1293
01:19:41,751 --> 01:19:42,752
This'll work.

1294
01:19:42,835 --> 01:19:44,295
Let's go.

1295
01:19:55,181 --> 01:19:56,557
You're amazing.

1296
01:19:56,641 --> 01:19:58,059
It's a work of genius.

1297
01:19:58,100 --> 01:19:59,060
Uh-huh.

1298
01:20:07,818 --> 01:20:09,779
You okay?

1299
01:20:09,862 --> 01:20:10,780
Just give me a moment.

1300
01:20:10,863 --> 01:20:11,989
Now?

1301
01:20:12,073 --> 01:20:15,242
I'm about to insert this pin
into this detonator tube,

1302
01:20:15,284 --> 01:20:17,244
and if the brass touches
the sides,

1303
01:20:17,411 --> 01:20:19,872
we'll both be the last people
we ever see.

1304
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:24,585
Take all the time you need.

1305
01:20:27,630 --> 01:20:29,215
Hey, Charlie.

1306
01:20:29,256 --> 01:20:32,259
What?

1307
01:20:32,385 --> 01:20:35,763
I love you, man.

1308
01:20:35,805 --> 01:20:38,099
I love you, too.

1309
01:20:40,643 --> 01:20:43,771
Okay.
Okay.

1310
01:20:54,156 --> 01:20:55,950
Your attention, please.

1311
01:20:55,992 --> 01:20:57,827
Metrolink train number 774
will arrive

1312
01:20:57,910 --> 01:20:59,662
in approximately 15 minutes.

1313
01:21:16,637 --> 01:21:18,180
Check positions.

1314
01:21:18,264 --> 01:21:19,265
Napster?

1315
01:21:19,348 --> 01:21:22,184
I'm in position.

1316
01:21:22,268 --> 01:21:23,769
Handsome Rob?

1317
01:21:23,853 --> 01:21:25,062
We're in position.

1318
01:21:25,146 --> 01:21:27,148
Everything's quiet, Charlie.

1319
01:21:30,234 --> 01:21:32,236
Wrench?

1320
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:33,988
Set.

1321
01:21:50,212 --> 01:21:51,881
Charlie, we got
an uninvited visitor.

1322
01:21:51,964 --> 01:21:54,634
Some motorcycle guard
following the truck.

1323
01:21:54,717 --> 01:21:55,676
We'll deal with it.

1324
01:22:02,058 --> 01:22:03,768
Who are these cats?

1325
01:22:03,851 --> 01:22:04,894
What's wrong?

1326
01:22:04,977 --> 01:22:06,938
Charlie, you won't believe this.

1327
01:22:07,021 --> 01:22:09,065
He's brought in
three armored trucks.

1328
01:22:09,148 --> 01:22:12,693
It's a shell game.
Shell game now.

1329
01:22:12,777 --> 01:22:14,528
Well, boss,
I can't reroute the truck

1330
01:22:14,570 --> 01:22:16,405
if I don't know which truck
to reroute.

1331
01:22:16,489 --> 01:22:18,240
Just go with the one
Steve follows in the helicopter.

1332
01:22:18,366 --> 01:22:21,619
Remember, he said he'd never let
that gold out of his sight.

1333
01:22:21,702 --> 01:22:23,746
Unless he's playing us,
and he is.

1334
01:22:35,091 --> 01:22:36,759
Okay, let's go!

1335
01:22:36,842 --> 01:22:38,844
Moving out!

1336
01:22:51,482 --> 01:22:53,067
Here we go.

1337
01:22:53,150 --> 01:22:54,777
They're pulling out.

1338
01:22:54,860 --> 01:22:56,487
Napster,

1339
01:22:56,570 --> 01:22:59,448
pull up the traffic cameras
you're watching.

1340
01:22:59,532 --> 01:23:02,243
Where's the first camera
the trucks go past?

1341
01:23:05,288 --> 01:23:07,999
Vine and Yucca; they're all
going to cross there.

1342
01:23:08,082 --> 01:23:10,251
See which one's riding low.

1343
01:23:21,220 --> 01:23:22,638
First one is...

1344
01:23:25,141 --> 01:23:26,851
First two are the same, so...

1345
01:23:31,063 --> 01:23:33,941
Houston, we have our truck.
It is number 128.

1346
01:23:42,825 --> 01:23:44,827
We're moving out.

1347
01:23:46,329 --> 01:23:48,205
Three-kilo-bob
to two-fox-mike,

1348
01:23:48,289 --> 01:23:49,498
we're heading to the airport.

1349
01:24:04,096 --> 01:24:08,059
Okay, guys, truck 128
has turned right heading west.

1350
01:24:08,142 --> 01:24:09,810
Gridlock time.

1351
01:24:11,395 --> 01:24:15,024
Mr. Scott, pick up
a courtesy telephone please.

1352
01:24:15,107 --> 01:24:16,984
Mr. Scott, pick up a courtesy...

1353
01:24:18,986 --> 01:24:20,905
We've crashed.

1354
01:24:22,698 --> 01:24:24,659
It's not a crash.

1355
01:24:25,826 --> 01:24:27,203
We've got power.

1356
01:24:28,287 --> 01:24:30,081
I can't log in.

1357
01:24:30,164 --> 01:24:34,543
They are about to hit a major
detour and be sent your way.

1358
01:24:41,467 --> 01:24:42,426
Oops.

1359
01:24:46,931 --> 01:24:50,184
You'll... never... shut down...

1360
01:24:50,267 --> 01:24:53,020
the real... Napster.

1361
01:25:00,736 --> 01:25:02,113
What's your problem?!

1362
01:25:08,452 --> 01:25:10,371
Truck 128,
what is your progress?

1363
01:25:10,413 --> 01:25:12,206
This is truck 128.

1364
01:25:12,248 --> 01:25:14,041
Traffic's out of control here.

1365
01:25:14,083 --> 01:25:16,043
We've got to look
for another route.

1366
01:25:16,085 --> 01:25:19,463
Check the police band.

1367
01:25:19,547 --> 01:25:21,465
Okay, I'm opening up
a space on Highland.

1368
01:25:25,803 --> 01:25:27,221
Oh, get us out of here.

1369
01:25:27,263 --> 01:25:28,347
I'm trying.

1370
01:25:33,227 --> 01:25:35,396
And he's taking it.

1371
01:25:41,027 --> 01:25:42,737
Police scanners are saying
computers are down

1372
01:25:42,820 --> 01:25:43,821
at Traffic Control Center.

1373
01:25:43,904 --> 01:25:46,949
Nice, Charlie.

1374
01:25:47,033 --> 01:25:49,243
What are you up to?

1375
01:25:49,327 --> 01:25:51,579
Go back.

1376
01:25:59,712 --> 01:26:02,006
I now command you to turn left.

1377
01:26:03,966 --> 01:26:05,468
Come on, take the left.

1378
01:26:07,637 --> 01:26:08,971
Yeah, you did.

1379
01:26:09,055 --> 01:26:10,598
You did.

1380
01:26:45,174 --> 01:26:46,467
Give us the flag.

1381
01:26:46,550 --> 01:26:48,552
Metro just passed through
the station.

1382
01:26:48,636 --> 01:26:50,638
You are clear for 90 seconds.

1383
01:26:50,721 --> 01:26:51,847
Go.

1384
01:27:08,030 --> 01:27:08,698
Come on, Steve.

1385
01:27:25,715 --> 01:27:26,590
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1386
01:27:30,845 --> 01:27:33,514
Look out!
Look out!

1387
01:27:33,597 --> 01:27:34,557
30 seconds and counting.

1388
01:27:42,148 --> 01:27:43,482
15 seconds,
you're either blocked in

1389
01:27:43,566 --> 01:27:44,692
or you're paint on the train.

1390
01:27:50,656 --> 01:27:51,616
Go, go, come on, come on!

1391
01:27:52,867 --> 01:27:54,410
Stay right on me,
this is gonna be tight.

1392
01:28:01,459 --> 01:28:02,877
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1393
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:04,879
You're gonna stop right there.

1394
01:28:43,292 --> 01:28:44,752
Okay, guys.

1395
01:28:44,835 --> 01:28:46,253
Coming into position.

1396
01:28:46,337 --> 01:28:47,630
Stay cool.

1397
01:28:59,684 --> 01:29:01,018
Ten...

1398
01:29:01,102 --> 01:29:03,145
nine...

1399
01:29:03,229 --> 01:29:04,939
eight...

1400
01:29:05,022 --> 01:29:06,774
seven...

1401
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:08,150
six...

1402
01:29:08,234 --> 01:29:09,860
five...

1403
01:29:09,944 --> 01:29:11,612
four...

1404
01:29:11,696 --> 01:29:12,446
Don't lose 'em,
don't lose 'em,

1405
01:29:12,530 --> 01:29:13,948
- Don't lose them.
- Three...

1406
01:29:14,031 --> 01:29:15,950
two...

1407
01:29:16,033 --> 01:29:17,702
one.

1408
01:29:39,307 --> 01:29:40,891
Damn.

1409
01:29:47,148 --> 01:29:48,691
Where's my truck?

1410
01:29:48,774 --> 01:29:51,277
What...? What the fuck
happened to my truck?!

1411
01:29:55,740 --> 01:29:57,658
It just blew right through
the street.

1412
01:29:57,700 --> 01:29:59,160
Well, get under there.

1413
01:30:09,879 --> 01:30:12,590
We have another problem, guys.

1414
01:30:12,673 --> 01:30:13,466
What?

1415
01:30:14,592 --> 01:30:16,427
This isn't the Worthington 1000.

1416
01:30:16,510 --> 01:30:17,345
What?

1417
01:30:18,679 --> 01:30:20,264
He switched safes on us.

1418
01:30:21,724 --> 01:30:22,933
Can you do it?

1419
01:30:23,017 --> 01:30:24,352
It's Israeli made.

1420
01:30:24,435 --> 01:30:26,062
It's got a glass re-lock system.

1421
01:30:26,145 --> 01:30:28,272
There's a pane of glass
right here behind this door.

1422
01:30:28,356 --> 01:30:30,066
And if I don't drill perfectly
through that hole,

1423
01:30:30,149 --> 01:30:32,026
steel rods snap into place

1424
01:30:32,068 --> 01:30:33,235
and you can't open the safe.

1425
01:30:33,319 --> 01:30:35,029
And then we're up shit creek.

1426
01:31:04,350 --> 01:31:07,853
I think I just
cracked the glass.

1427
01:31:09,063 --> 01:31:10,940
I don't think it broke though.

1428
01:31:11,023 --> 01:31:13,818
I can't drill it again.

1429
01:31:13,901 --> 01:31:16,404
I have to do it by touch.

1430
01:31:18,823 --> 01:31:19,991
I can't get through.

1431
01:31:20,074 --> 01:31:21,575
The train's blocking the tunnel.

1432
01:31:21,659 --> 01:31:23,536
Where does the Metro rail
come above ground?

1433
01:31:23,577 --> 01:31:24,578
11th and Fig.

1434
01:31:24,620 --> 01:31:26,247
Positions two and three,

1435
01:31:26,330 --> 01:31:28,124
meet at 11th and Figueroa
and double back

1436
01:31:28,207 --> 01:31:29,250
to Hollywood and Highland.

1437
01:31:29,333 --> 01:31:30,918
Hurry up!

1438
01:31:45,641 --> 01:31:47,602
Your attention please.

1439
01:31:47,685 --> 01:31:49,687
Baggage for train number 22

1440
01:31:49,770 --> 01:31:51,981
is now available
at carousel number four.

1441
01:31:52,064 --> 01:31:54,942
Baggage for train number 22
is now available

1442
01:31:55,026 --> 01:31:56,777
at carousel number four.

1443
01:32:30,186 --> 01:32:32,146
I can't do this, Charlie.

1444
01:32:32,188 --> 01:32:33,147
Stella...

1445
01:32:33,189 --> 01:32:34,273
I can't do it...
I need a drill,

1446
01:32:34,398 --> 01:32:35,566
a borescope, something.

1447
01:32:35,650 --> 01:32:36,984
- I need to...
- You don't need any of that.

1448
01:32:37,068 --> 01:32:38,402
Come on, Charlie.

1449
01:32:38,486 --> 01:32:40,655
Hey, you can do this.

1450
01:33:35,751 --> 01:33:36,961
Slide.

1451
01:33:37,044 --> 01:33:38,337
Come on, come on.

1452
01:33:44,885 --> 01:33:46,387
Hey.

1453
01:33:46,470 --> 01:33:49,640
Don't you want to see
what's inside?

1454
01:33:49,724 --> 01:33:50,808
Absolutely.

1455
01:33:54,103 --> 01:33:55,605
Napster.

1456
01:33:55,688 --> 01:33:56,606
Yeah?

1457
01:33:56,689 --> 01:33:58,691
13 across, four high, four deep.

1458
01:34:00,359 --> 01:34:02,778
That's, uh, 208 bricks.

1459
01:34:02,862 --> 01:34:04,030
How much?

1460
01:34:04,071 --> 01:34:06,449
Oh. Uh, 208 times...

1461
01:34:09,910 --> 01:34:11,412
2.7... 2.7 million.

1462
01:34:11,454 --> 01:34:12,204
What?

1463
01:34:13,247 --> 01:34:14,373
No, it's 27.

1464
01:34:14,457 --> 01:34:15,833
That's 27 million.

1465
01:34:15,916 --> 01:34:17,835
That's $27 million
worth of gold.

1466
01:34:22,173 --> 01:34:25,217
Yeah!

1467
01:34:25,259 --> 01:34:29,180
Got the... holy spirit.

1468
01:34:29,263 --> 01:34:31,682
You should get on it.
It's a good train.

1469
01:35:08,970 --> 01:35:10,429
What did you think, John?

1470
01:35:18,562 --> 01:35:20,106
27 million.

1471
01:35:20,147 --> 01:35:21,607
Say it again.

1472
01:35:21,649 --> 01:35:23,985
- 27 million.
- Say it again.

1473
01:35:24,026 --> 01:35:25,987
- Say it again!
- 27 million.

1474
01:35:26,028 --> 01:35:27,196
Say it again!

1475
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:52,430
Two motorcycles on us, Charlie.

1476
01:35:55,766 --> 01:35:57,435
I've got three Minis
in the storm drain

1477
01:35:57,518 --> 01:35:59,061
heading east towards
the L.A. River.

1478
01:35:59,145 --> 01:36:00,730
Stop them before they get
to the street.

1479
01:36:05,735 --> 01:36:06,777
Shit!

1480
01:36:11,032 --> 01:36:11,657
Whoa!

1481
01:36:25,921 --> 01:36:26,797
Here we go.

1482
01:36:36,057 --> 01:36:36,682
Whoo!

1483
01:36:38,768 --> 01:36:39,310
Whoa! Whoa!

1484
01:36:42,063 --> 01:36:42,647
Open your door.

1485
01:36:47,985 --> 01:36:50,071
Come on, guys, we're moving.

1486
01:36:55,284 --> 01:36:56,744
There, there, there, there,
there, there.

1487
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:09,048
Hey, come on, come on, look out.

1488
01:37:36,325 --> 01:37:37,952
Come on!

1489
01:37:44,750 --> 01:37:46,961
Where you going?
Where you going?

1490
01:38:06,397 --> 01:38:07,273
I'm going to take Steve.

1491
01:38:07,315 --> 01:38:08,441
You guys go straight
to Union Station.

1492
01:38:08,482 --> 01:38:09,692
I'll meet you there.

1493
01:38:10,943 --> 01:38:12,486
Stay on him.
Stay on him!

1494
01:38:20,953 --> 01:38:23,039
Okay, Charlie, I'm opening up
a spot on lower Grand.

1495
01:38:26,542 --> 01:38:28,210
I know it's you, Charlie.

1496
01:38:30,212 --> 01:38:31,213
Take your next left.

1497
01:39:30,940 --> 01:39:32,233
Nice move, Steve.

1498
01:40:10,646 --> 01:40:11,731
Get out!

1499
01:40:11,772 --> 01:40:13,608
- Get out!
- Okay.

1500
01:40:13,691 --> 01:40:15,234
I said get out!

1501
01:41:50,037 --> 01:41:50,997
They got a bunch of cars

1502
01:41:51,038 --> 01:41:52,665
in there, right?
Mini Coopers?

1503
01:41:52,707 --> 01:41:54,709
Look, look, man...

1504
01:41:54,792 --> 01:41:57,211
- I don't know anything...
- Hey, don't worry about them.

1505
01:41:57,253 --> 01:41:59,672
I'll give you five grand
you put me inside that car.

1506
01:42:04,176 --> 01:42:06,554
Buy your girlfriend
something nice.

1507
01:42:11,183 --> 01:42:12,852
Come on.

1508
01:42:18,608 --> 01:42:20,693
Half now, half when
you help me unload.

1509
01:42:25,615 --> 01:42:27,742
I've got to hand it
to you, Steve.

1510
01:42:27,825 --> 01:42:31,078
You actually played this one
pretty smart.

1511
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:33,748
Decoy trucks...
you switched safes.

1512
01:42:33,831 --> 01:42:35,041
The helicopter routine,

1513
01:42:35,082 --> 01:42:36,876
I mean, that was
pretty damn good.

1514
01:42:36,917 --> 01:42:40,546
But now I've got the gold...
and you, you've got nothing.

1515
01:42:40,588 --> 01:42:41,380
I got this.

1516
01:42:41,422 --> 01:42:42,632
So cut the crap,

1517
01:42:42,715 --> 01:42:44,425
and give me my goddamn gold!

1518
01:42:58,481 --> 01:43:00,441
Who the hell are you?

1519
01:43:00,483 --> 01:43:02,276
I am Mashkov...

1520
01:43:02,401 --> 01:43:04,278
and you killed my cousin Yevhen.

1521
01:43:04,403 --> 01:43:06,322
Got to have some insurance,
Steve.

1522
01:43:15,790 --> 01:43:17,458
Yevhen was already dead
when I got there.

1523
01:43:17,541 --> 01:43:19,585
I'm sorry about that,
but Yevhen dealt with

1524
01:43:19,627 --> 01:43:20,795
a lot of unsavory people.

1525
01:43:20,878 --> 01:43:22,546
Now, this guy's
trying to play you.

1526
01:43:22,630 --> 01:43:24,590
You are right...

1527
01:43:24,674 --> 01:43:26,634
no imagination.

1528
01:43:29,428 --> 01:43:30,972
There's a lot of gold in there.

1529
01:43:31,055 --> 01:43:32,598
We're the only ones with guns.

1530
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:34,058
I'll make you a good deal.

1531
01:43:42,149 --> 01:43:43,985
I've already made my deal.

1532
01:43:49,323 --> 01:43:50,658
What do you want?

1533
01:43:50,741 --> 01:43:52,994
You know this was
never about the gold.

1534
01:43:53,077 --> 01:43:55,246
Whatever helps you
sleep at night, sweetheart.

1535
01:43:59,667 --> 01:44:01,294
Bitch!

1536
01:44:01,377 --> 01:44:03,087
Charlie! Come on, Charlie!

1537
01:44:04,672 --> 01:44:05,798
Okay.

1538
01:44:09,260 --> 01:44:10,511
Wait a minute
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1539
01:44:10,594 --> 01:44:12,179
Wait a minute. I'll double
whatever he's giving you.

1540
01:44:12,263 --> 01:44:13,180
Just don't shoot me.

1541
01:44:13,264 --> 01:44:15,433
Don't worry, I'm not
going to shoot you.

1542
01:44:15,516 --> 01:44:18,477
No, I'm going to take you
to my workplace.

1543
01:44:18,561 --> 01:44:20,396
I think you would be
very interested

1544
01:44:20,479 --> 01:44:22,064
in some of the machinery I use.

1545
01:44:24,984 --> 01:44:25,943
No, come on.

1546
01:44:31,532 --> 01:44:32,575
Guys.

1547
01:44:32,658 --> 01:44:34,785
I want to make a toast.

1548
01:44:34,869 --> 01:44:36,245
To John Bridger,

1549
01:44:36,329 --> 01:44:38,998
the most brilliant
master planner of all.

1550
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:41,000
Father and friend.

1551
01:44:41,042 --> 01:44:42,084
To my dad.

1552
01:44:47,048 --> 01:44:48,257
Stella was right.

1553
01:44:48,341 --> 01:44:49,800
It wasn't about the money.

1554
01:44:49,884 --> 01:44:51,344
Of course that
didn't stop the guys

1555
01:44:51,427 --> 01:44:52,762
from having a little bit of fun.

1556
01:44:52,845 --> 01:44:54,764
Money!

1557
01:44:54,847 --> 01:44:57,266
Handsome Rob
got his Aston Martin.

1558
01:44:58,893 --> 01:45:01,812
Get a good job with good pay...

1559
01:45:01,896 --> 01:45:04,106
He took it
for a ride to break it in.

1560
01:45:06,359 --> 01:45:12,740
Money, it's a gas

1561
01:45:12,782 --> 01:45:17,995
Grab that cash with both hands
and make a stash

1562
01:45:18,079 --> 01:45:19,538
He got off with a warning.

1563
01:45:19,622 --> 01:45:23,209
New car, caviar,
four star daydream

1564
01:45:23,292 --> 01:45:25,878
Left Ear got his dream house
in the south of Spain

1565
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:28,923
with a room just for his shoes.

1566
01:45:28,965 --> 01:45:30,049
Buenos dias.

1567
01:45:30,091 --> 01:45:33,219
Buenos dias.

1568
01:45:33,302 --> 01:45:37,431
Money, get back

1569
01:45:37,515 --> 01:45:39,934
Lyle finally made the cover
of Wired Magazine.

1570
01:45:39,976 --> 01:45:44,438
I'm all right, Jack, keep
your hands off of my stack

1571
01:45:44,522 --> 01:45:45,606
Are you really the Napster?

1572
01:45:45,690 --> 01:45:47,066
Money!

1573
01:45:47,108 --> 01:45:48,234
Yes, I am.

1574
01:45:48,317 --> 01:45:50,278
And he got that
kick-ass stereo he wanted.

1575
01:45:50,403 --> 01:45:54,448
Uh, would you listen
to something for me?

1576
01:45:54,532 --> 01:45:55,658
With speakers so loud

1577
01:45:55,741 --> 01:45:57,952
they'd blow
a woman's clothes off.

1578
01:45:57,994 --> 01:46:01,455
I'm in the high-fidelity...

1579
01:46:01,539 --> 01:46:02,665
If you would.

1580
01:46:02,748 --> 01:46:04,250
...first class traveling set

1581
01:46:04,333 --> 01:46:09,755
And I think I need a Lear jet

1582
01:46:18,472 --> 01:46:20,224
And me?

1583
01:46:20,308 --> 01:46:23,227
I took John Bridger's advice.

1584
01:46:23,311 --> 01:46:26,564
I found somebody I want to spend
the rest of my life with

1585
01:46:26,647 --> 01:46:28,232
and I'm gonna hold on
to her forever.

1586
01:47:31,837 --> 01:47:34,215
Money!

1587
01:47:34,298 --> 01:47:37,885
It's a crime

1588
01:47:37,969 --> 01:47:45,101
Share it fairly, but don't
take a slice of my pie

1589
01:47:45,184 --> 01:47:51,440
Money, so they say

1590
01:47:51,524 --> 01:47:58,572
Is the root of all evil today

1591
01:47:58,656 --> 01:48:03,452
But if you ask for a raise
it's no surprise

1592
01:48:03,536 --> 01:48:06,956
They're giving none away

1593
01:48:07,039 --> 01:48:09,041
Away... away...

1594
01:48:09,125 --> 01:48:10,084
Away...

1595
01:48:10,126 --> 01:48:13,546
Away... away...

1596
01:48:13,587 --> 01:48:14,547
Away...

1597
01:48:14,588 --> 01:48:16,882
Away... away...

1598
01:48:16,924 --> 01:48:17,883
Away...

1599
01:48:17,925 --> 01:48:19,885
Away... away...

1600
01:48:19,927 --> 01:48:20,886
Away...

1601
01:48:20,928 --> 01:48:22,888
Away... away...

1602
01:48:22,930 --> 01:48:23,889
Away...

1603
01:48:23,931 --> 01:48:25,891
Away... away...

1604
01:48:25,933 --> 01:48:26,892
Away...

1605
01:48:26,934 --> 01:48:28,894
Away... away...

1606
01:48:28,936 --> 01:48:29,895
Away...

1607
01:48:29,937 --> 01:48:31,897
Away... away...

1608
01:48:31,939 --> 01:48:32,898
Away...

1609
01:48:32,940 --> 01:48:34,900
