tried to emulate his father,

497
00:28:35,841 --> 00:28:37,843
he decided to go
into the oil business.

498
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,970
<i>He founded an oil company,
<i>a drilling company,</i></i>

499
00:28:40,137 --> 00:28:41,889
<i>out in west Texas called Arbusto,</i>

500
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:46,226
<i>which was very, very good at drilling
<i>dry holes that nothing came out of.</i></i>

501
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:49,146
<i>But the question has always been,
<i>where did this money come from?</i></i>

502
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:50,189
<i>Now, his dad,</i>

503
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:53,692
his dad was rich.
His dad could have done this for him.

504
00:28:53,859 --> 00:28:55,944
But his dad didn't do this for him.

505
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:57,988
There's no indication that Daddy
wrote a check

506
00:28:58,155 --> 00:29:00,073
to start him off in this company.

507
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:03,702
[Michael Moore]<i> So where did
<i>George W. Bush get his money?</i></i>

508

509
00:29:05,746 --> 00:29:08,916
[Michael Moore]<i> One person who did

510

511

<i>to manage their money
<i>in Texas and invest in businesses.</i></i>

512

[theme song]

514
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:34,274
<i>Bush ran Arbusto into the ground,</i>

515
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:37,236
<i>as he did every other company
<i>he was involved in.</i></i>

516
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:41,240
<i>Until, finally, one of his companies
<i>was bought by Harken Energy.</i></i>

517
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:45,118
<i>And they gave him
<i>a seat on their board.</i></i>

518
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:47,162
[Jim Moore]
<i>A lot of us had suspected</i>

519
00:29:47,329 --> 00:29:50,666
through the years,
that there has been Saudi oil money

520
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:52,292
involved in all of these companies.

521
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:56,255
Harken, Spectrum Seven,
Arbusto Drilling,

522
00:29:56,421 --> 00:29:57,673
all of the Bush companies.

523
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,843
Whenever they got into trouble,
there were these angel investors

524
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:02,845
who flowed money into the companies.

525
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:07,516
So, the question is, why Saudis,
who had all the oil in the world,

526
00:30:07,683 --> 00:30:12,479
go around the globe
to invest in this lousy oil company?

527
00:30:12,646 --> 00:30:14,606
And the thing is it had one big asset,

528
00:30:14,773 --> 00:30:18,819
Harken had one thing going for it,
which is that George W. Bush

529
00:30:18,986 --> 00:30:20,362
was on its board of directors

530
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:23,532
at a time when his father was
President of the United States.

531
00:30:23,699 --> 00:30:27,035
When you're the president's son,
and you've got unlimited access,

532
00:30:27,202 --> 00:30:30,414
combined with some credentials
from a prior campaign,

533
00:30:31,123 --> 00:30:33,667
in Washington D.C.,
people tend to respect that.

534
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:35,252
And, access is power.

535
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:39,965

and talk to him any time of the day.

And then in fact,
the Bin Laden family was invested

577
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:42,337
in one of their defense funds,
which ironically meant

578
00:32:42,504 --> 00:32:45,132

679

685

I mean, I'd be glad to visit with them.

What it will do is,
the hole that's in my heart,

703
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:56,461
and has been in my heart
since September 11th,

704
00:38:56,628 --> 00:38:59,464
I lost my husband of fifteen years.

705
00:38:59,631 --> 00:39:02,509
I am now by myself. Um...

706
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:06,430
I need to know what happened to him.

707
00:39:07,681 --> 00:39:12,144
I know what I got back,
from the... the autopsy.

708
00:39:12,311 --> 00:39:13,187
Uh...

709
00:39:13,353 --> 00:39:17,232
That man was my life,
and I have no plan.

710
00:39:18,192 --> 00:39:20,152
I took a... I was taking a class,

711
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:23,697
and they asked me what was I going
to do in the next five years.

712
00:39:23,864 --> 00:39:26,158
And if I'm not doing something with this,

713
00:39:26,325 --> 00:39:28,577
I don't know what reason
I have to live.

714
00:39:28,744 --> 00:39:30,954
So, it's very important.

715
00:39:32,206 --> 00:39:33,498
Very important.

716
00:39:34,082 --> 00:39:36,502

the Watergate hotel and office building,

726

the Kennedy center over there,

727
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:11,828
and the embassy of Saudi Arabia.

728

Yeah! [chuckling]

729
00:40:14,373 --> 00:40:18,210
How much money do the Saudis
have invested in America, roughly?

730
00:40:18,377 --> 00:40:22,339
I've heard figures
as high as 860 billion dollars.

860 billion?

732

-That's a lot of money!
-A lot!

734
00:40:28,262 --> 00:40:29,680
And, uh...

735
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,850
what, what percentage of our economy
does that represent?

736
00:40:33,016 --> 00:40:34,059
It seems like a lot.

737
00:40:34,226 --> 00:40:36,770
[Craig Unger] Well, in terms
of in investments on Wall Street,

738
00:40:36,937 --> 00:40:38,897
American equities, it's roughly

739
00:40:39,064 --> 00:40:41,692
six or seven percent of America.

740
00:40:42,234 --> 00:40:44,319
They own a fairly
good slice of America.

741
00:40:44,862 --> 00:40:47,573
And most of that money goes
into the great blue chip companies.

742
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:52,077
Citigroup, Citibank is
the largest stockholder is a Saudi.

743
00:40:52,244 --> 00:40:55,914
AOL Time Warner
has big Saudi investors.

744
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:59,126
[Michael Moore] So, I read
the Saudis have a trillion dollars

745
00:40:59,293 --> 00:41:02,212
in our banks, of their money.
What would happen if like, one day,

746
00:41:02,379 --> 00:41:04,047
they just pulled
that trillion dollars out?

747
00:41:04,214 --> 00:41:05,507
[Craig Unger] A trillion dollars?

748
00:41:05,674 --> 00:41:07,467
That would be
an enormous blow to the economy.

749
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:08,802
[Michael Moore] Right, right.

750
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:10,345
Mr. Moore,
can I speak to you for a moment?

751
00:41:10,512 --> 00:41:11,471

what did the president say to you?

with the clear indication

811
00:43:58,222 --> 00:44:01,225
that he wanted us to come back
with the word that there was an Iraqi hand

812
00:44:01,391 --> 00:44:04,228
behind 9/11, because they had been
planning to do something

813

about Iraq from before the time
they came into office.

814
00:44:06,563 --> 00:44:07,606
Did he ask about any other

815
00:44:07,773 --> 00:44:09,274
-nations other than Iraq?
-No. No, no.

816
00:44:09,441 --> 00:44:12,611
No, not at all, it was
"Iraq, Saddam, find out, get back to me!"

817
00:44:12,778 --> 00:44:15,656

about Iraq than about Al-Qaeda?

<i>Aaron Kilner was assigned

1151
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:38,495
that he was able

1152
00:59:38,662 --> 00:59:40,372
that are open to the public.

1153
00:59:40,956 --> 00:59:42,875
[Michael Moore]
<i>You could understand why the police</i>

1154
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:45,419
<i>needed to spy on a group
<i>like Peace Fresno.</i></i>

1155
00:59:45,878 --> 00:59:46,795
<i>Just look at them!</i>

1156
00:59:48,797 --> 00:59:50,966
<i>A gathering of terrorists,

00:59:59,057 --> 01:00:01,852
<i>Barry likes to work out in the gym.</i>

1161

<i>Somewhere between his cardio
<i>and his strength training,</i></i>

1162
01:00:05,564 --> 01:00:07,274
<i>Barry got political.</i>

1163
01:00:08,025 --> 01:00:11,778
We were up in the gym
and it was after we were working out

1164
01:00:11,945 --> 01:00:16,450
and a number of us were talking
about 9/11 and Afghanistan and Bin Laden,

1165
01:00:16,617 --> 01:00:18,493
and someone said:

1166
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:21,872
"Bin Laden's a real asshole
for murdering those people."

1167
01:00:22,039 --> 01:00:24,041
and I said: "Yeah that's true!

1168
01:00:24,208 --> 01:00:27,586
But he will never be
as big an asshole as Bush,

1169
01:00:27,753 --> 01:00:30,422
who bombs all over
the world for oil profits."

1170
01:00:30,589 --> 01:00:33,842
[Michael Moore]<i> Barry didn't have
<i>to worry about the police spying on him.</i></i>

1171
01:00:34,801 --> 01:00:38,263
<i>His fellow weight lifters were
<i>more than willing to turn him in.</i></i>

1172
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:41,642
I was taking a nap,
and I guess it was 1:30 p.m.,

1173
01:00:41,808 --> 01:00:43,227
two o'clock in the afternoon,

1174
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:46,605
<i>and they came to my place and I said:</i>

1175
01:00:46,772 --> 01:00:49,274
"Well, who's there?"
and they said: "The FBI."

1176
01:00:49,441 --> 01:00:50,567
I said: "The FBI?"

1177
01:00:50,734 --> 01:00:52,694
I mean, why are they here?

1178
01:00:52,861 --> 01:00:54,821
[Michael Moore]
<i>Yes, the FBI had come to see Barry,</i>

1179
01:00:55,781 --> 01:00:58,200
<i>and they weren't
<i>there to Jazzercize.</i></i>

1180
01:00:58,367 --> 01:00:59,952
[Barry] <i>The FBI said:</i>

1181
01:01:00,118 --> 01:01:02,538
"Have you been talking
to people about 9/11

1182
01:01:02,704 --> 01:01:07,209
and about Bin Laden
and oil profits and Afghanistan?"

1183
01:01:07,376 --> 01:01:10,671
I said: "A lot of people
are talking about these things."

1184
01:01:10,838 --> 01:01:14,883
And I feel my rights have been,
you know, trampled on.

1185
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:19,096
I mean, if you have something
to say to me in the gym, well, then, fine!

1186
01:01:19,263 --> 01:01:24,309
Don't tell the FBI and they come
to my apartment while I'm taking a nap.

1187
01:01:24,726 --> 01:01:27,813
There's nothing to be ashamed of here.
There is full transparency.

1188
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:31,275
There is nothing about the PATRIOT Act
that I am ashamed of

1189
01:01:31,441 --> 01:01:33,402
in any way, shape or form.

1190
01:01:33,569 --> 01:01:35,737
I have a 1-800 number, call me!

1191
01:01:35,904 --> 01:01:39,408
I'm the guy you call,
if there's a violation or abuse.

1192
01:01:39,575 --> 01:01:42,953
If you've got a poster child on this,
I wanna see it, that's what I do.

1193
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:45,831
I'm hired by the people
of the United States to provide oversight,

1194
01:01:45,998 --> 01:01:47,124
I provide oversight.

1195
01:01:47,291 --> 01:01:50,335
Trent Lott said
the day the bill was introduced:

1196
01:01:50,502 --> 01:01:54,590
"Maybe now we can do things we've wanted
to do for the last ten years."

1197
01:01:55,215 --> 01:01:57,926
You know, a dictatorship
would be a heck of a lot easier,

1198
01:01:58,093 --> 01:01:59,636
-it's no question about it.
-[laughter]

1199
01:01:59,803 --> 01:02:03,974
I mean, they had all this
on the shelf somewhere,

1200
01:02:04,141 --> 01:02:06,852
ideas of things they would like to do.

1201
01:02:07,019 --> 01:02:11,023
And they got 9/11 and they said:
"It's our chance! Go for it!"

1202
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:15,277
There was an immediate assumption
on the part of the Administration

1203
01:02:15,444 --> 01:02:20,574
that there had to be a surrender
of certain of our rights.

1204
01:02:20,741 --> 01:02:23,243
There's several definitions
in the Bill that are quite troubling.

1205
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:25,871
First of all,
the definition of "terrorist"!

1206
01:02:26,038 --> 01:02:31,960
It's so expansive
that it could include people--

1207
01:02:32,127 --> 01:02:33,670
-[Michael Moore] Like me?
-[laughing]

1208
01:02:33,837 --> 01:02:36,340
No one read it, that's the whole point!

1209
01:02:36,507 --> 01:02:39,426
They wait till the middle of the night,
they drop it in the middle of the night,

1210
01:02:39,593 --> 01:02:41,470
it's printed in the middle of the night,

1211
01:02:41,637 --> 01:02:43,972
and the next morning
when we come in, it passes.

1212
01:02:44,139 --> 01:02:46,183
[Michael Moore]
Erm, how could Congress

1213
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:49,728
pass this PATRIOT Act
without even reading it?

1214
01:02:49,895 --> 01:02:51,188
Sit down, my son!

1215
01:02:52,314 --> 01:02:55,359
Uh, we don't read most of the bills.

1216
01:02:55,526 --> 01:02:57,194
[ethereal music]

1217
01:02:57,361 --> 01:03:00,113
Do you really know what that would entail

1218
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:04,326
if we were to read every bill
that we pass?

1219
01:03:05,827 --> 01:03:07,162
Uh...

1220
01:03:07,746 --> 01:03:11,416
Well the good thing, it would slow down
the legislative process.

1221
01:03:11,583 --> 01:03:15,379
[Michael Moore]<i> I couldn't believe that
<i>virtually no member of Congress had read</i></i>

1222
01:03:15,546 --> 01:03:17,756
<i>the PATRIOT Act before voting on it.</i>

1223
01:03:17,923 --> 01:03:22,261
<i>So I decided the only
<i>patriotic thing to do was for me</i></i>

1224
01:03:22,427 --> 01:03:23,971

1225

[on loudspeaker]<i> Members of Congress,
<i>this is Michael Moore!</i></i>

1227
01:03:28,225 --> 01:03:30,769
<i>I would like to read you

1228
01:03:30,936 --> 01:03:35,816

<i>Section 2703 C.</i>

1230
01:03:37,943 --> 01:03:41,572
My job is to secure the homeland
and that's exactly what we're going to do.

1231
01:03:41,738 --> 01:03:43,365
But I'm here to take somebody's order.

1232
01:03:43,532 --> 01:03:45,200
-[accordion playing]

1233
01:03:45,367 --> 01:03:46,952
That would be you, Stretch,
what would you like?

1234
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:49,496
-Right behind you!
-I'm gonna order some ribs!

1235
01:03:49,663 --> 01:03:53,208
[Michael Moore]<i> We all know you can't
<i>secure the homeland on an empty stomach.</i></i>

1236
01:03:53,375 --> 01:03:57,754
<i>And in order to remain secure,
<i>everyone needs to sacrifice.</i></i>

1237
01:03:58,755 --> 01:04:01,466
<i>Especially little Patrick Hamilton.</i>

1238
01:04:02,593 --> 01:04:07,181
<i>I'm sure each of us has our own personal
<i>airport security horror story.</i></i>

1239
01:04:08,348 --> 01:04:09,683
<i>But here's my favorite:</i>

1240
01:04:10,767 --> 01:04:15,147
<i>the terrorist threat that was posed
<i>by his mommy's breast milk.</i></i>

1241
01:04:15,314 --> 01:04:18,901
I thought if I just put a little bit
on my lips, then that would be sufficient

1242
01:04:19,067 --> 01:04:20,444
because obviously I'm tasting it.

1243
01:04:20,611 --> 01:04:23,113
And she looked at me
and I felt like she was telling me:

1244
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:26,366
"You need to chug that."
She goes: "No, you need to drink more."

1245
01:04:26,533 --> 01:04:30,871
And of a four ounce bottle, I wound up
drinking two more ounces of breast milk

1246
01:04:31,038 --> 01:04:33,874
that, then, because it's touched my lips,
has to be tossed.

1247
01:04:34,499 --> 01:04:37,169
[Michael Moore]<i> While Homeland Security
<i>was making sure breast milk</i></i>

Actually, you can, yes, you're fine.

1253
01:04:49,056 --> 01:04:50,807
Oops! One too many books of matches.

1254
01:04:50,974 --> 01:04:53,685
You can have four books of matches
and two lighters.

1255
01:04:53,852 --> 01:04:57,314
When we already have the experience
of Richard Reid, the shoe bomber,

1256
01:04:57,481 --> 01:04:58,482
who would have

1257
01:04:58,649 --> 01:05:00,400
<i>blown up an airplane with his shoe bomb,</i>

1258

<i>had he had a butane lighter,
<i>according to the FBI,</i></i>

1259
01:05:02,653 --> 01:05:05,197
why would the Transportation
Security Agency say it's okay

1260
01:05:05,364 --> 01:05:07,699
to take four books of matches
and two lighters in your pockets

1261
01:05:07,866 --> 01:05:08,867
as you board an airplane?

1262
01:05:09,034 --> 01:05:10,702
<i>I'm guessing that somebody</i>

1263
01:05:10,869 --> 01:05:13,497
<i>put pressure on them to say, you know:</i>

1264
01:05:13,664 --> 01:05:15,916
<i>"When an airplane lands,
<i>people want to light up pretty quickly,</i></i>

1265

<i>OK, let me see if I got this straight!</i>

<i>Old guys in the gym? Bad.</i>

1268
01:05:21,797 --> 01:05:23,549
<i>Peace groups in Fresno? Bad.</i>

1269

<i>But matches and lighters on a plane?
<i>Oh, hey, no problem!</i></i>

1271
01:05:28,512 --> 01:05:33,559
<i>Was this really about our safety?

<i>Meet trooper Brooks.</i>

1280
01:06:00,002 --> 01:06:03,672
[trooper Brooks] I maybe get a chance
to hit this stretch of highway

1281
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:07,259
once, maybe twice
a week during my shifts.

1282
01:06:07,426 --> 01:06:11,221
Um, you know,
it's just to even drive up here and look.

1283
01:06:12,306 --> 01:06:13,765
You know, I mean, as far as I know,

1284
01:06:13,932 --> 01:06:16,059
somebody could...
There's lot of things they could do.

1285
01:06:16,226 --> 01:06:19,438
I don't even want to suspect,
because it just makes me ill inside.

[Michael Moore]
<i>Back at the State trooper patrol office,</i>

1287
01:06:21,899 --> 01:06:26,653
<i>thanks to the budget cuts, trooper Kenyon
<i>had to come in on his day off to catch up</i></i>

1288
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:28,155
<i>on some paperwork.</i>

1289
01:06:28,322 --> 01:06:31,074
For the most part, especially during
the summertime, when people show up,

1290
01:06:31,241 --> 01:06:33,535
this is exactly what they get,
they close the door,

1291
01:06:33,702 --> 01:06:36,371
they can read the sign
about the office closure,

1292
01:06:36,538 --> 01:06:39,958
and, it just basically explains that,
you know, due to our cutbacks,

1293
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:42,920
that our office is not open
for administrative business.

1294
01:06:43,086 --> 01:06:46,089
There's a little sign down at the bottom
that explains when the office is closed.

1295
01:06:46,256 --> 01:06:51,762
And that they can use the phone booth
to get in touch with our dispatch.

1296
01:06:52,471 --> 01:06:55,933
Ironically enough, that phone is a piece
of junk, it doesn't work very well,

1297
01:06:56,099 --> 01:06:58,435
so, half the time,
when they pick up the phone

1298
01:06:58,602 --> 01:07:02,272
and dispatch gets a bunch of static
and they don't hear anything.

1299
01:07:02,898 --> 01:07:05,943
For Tuesday,
there'll be no troop on patrol.

1300
01:07:06,109 --> 01:07:07,903
Wednesday,
there'll be no troop on patrol.

1301
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:10,239
Thursday,
there'll be no troop on patrol

1302
01:07:10,405 --> 01:07:14,034
You get calls all the time,
people will call in a suspicious vehicle,

1303
01:07:14,201 --> 01:07:16,662
or somebody looking suspicious,
you know...

1304
01:07:16,828 --> 01:07:19,831
And I don't hardly ever respond
to that anymore.

1305
01:07:19,998 --> 01:07:21,375
I just don't have the time to do it.

1306

1633
01:23:35,682 --> 01:23:38,018
I know our numbers
in the military have gone down.

1634
01:23:38,185 --> 01:23:39,603
<i>They talk about retention.</i>

1635
01:23:40,312 --> 01:23:41,939
[another soldier]
<i>Yeah, I never expected</i>

1636
01:23:42,105 --> 01:23:45,192
to be deployed this long,
I don't think anybody did.

1637
01:23:45,734 --> 01:23:48,403
I don't have any clue
as to why we're still in Iraq.

1638
01:23:48,570 --> 01:23:51,949
If Donald Rumsfeld was here,
I'd ask him for his resignation.

1639
01:23:52,115 --> 01:23:53,158
[shouting in background]

1640
01:23:53,325 --> 01:23:55,202
[Michael Moore]
<i>With the war not going as planned</i>

1641
01:23:55,827 --> 01:23:58,580
<i>and the military in need
<i>of many more troops...</i></i>

1642
01:23:59,623 --> 01:24:01,834
<i>where would they find the new recruits?</i>

1643
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,002
[news anchor]
<i>Military experts say three times</i>

1644
01:24:04,169 --> 01:24:07,756
<i>the 120,000 U.S. troops now deployed
<i>would be needed</i></i>

1645
01:24:07,923 --> 01:24:10,050
<i>to pacify and rebuild the country.</i>

1646
01:24:10,217 --> 01:24:11,468
[car rolling]

1647
01:24:11,635 --> 01:24:14,471
[Michael Moore]
<i>They would find them all across America</i>

1648
01:24:15,097 --> 01:24:18,350
<i>in the places that had been
<i>destroyed by the economy.</i></i>

1649
01:24:18,976 --> 01:24:23,522
<i>Places where one of the only jobs
<i>available was to join the army.</i></i>

1650
01:24:23,689 --> 01:24:26,775
<i>Places like my hometown of Flint,
<i>Michigan.</i></i>

1651
01:24:26,942 --> 01:24:28,610
[Torian Billings]
<i>I was watching TV one day,</i>

1652
01:24:28,777 --> 01:24:31,655
and they showed some of the buildings
and areas that had been hit by bombs

1653
01:24:31,822 --> 01:24:35,200
and things like that,
and while watching, I got to thinking,

1654
01:24:35,367 --> 01:24:39,037
parts of Flint look like that
and we ain't been in a war.

1655
01:24:39,830 --> 01:24:41,748
[Gregory Fitch]
Look at the neighborhood I live in!

1656
01:24:41,915 --> 01:24:43,208
Most of them are abandoned.

1657
01:24:43,375 --> 01:24:46,837
I mean, you know, that's not right,
you want to talk about terrorism?

1658
01:24:47,004 --> 01:24:50,048
Come right here, president Bush,
right here! Come right here!

1659
01:24:50,674 --> 01:24:53,051
He knows about this corner, I emailed him.

1660
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:56,388
At the end of January of '04,

1661
01:24:56,555 --> 01:24:59,141
the unemployment rate in Flint
was actually 17%,

1662
01:24:59,308 --> 01:25:02,060
<i>but you have
<i>to take into consideration as well</i></i>

1663
01:25:02,227 --> 01:25:05,189
<i>that when your unemployment runs out,
<i>you're no longer counted.</i></i>

1664
01:25:05,355 --> 01:25:10,068
<i>I would say that we're probably close
<i>to at least 50%, not working</i></i>

1665
01:25:10,235 --> 01:25:11,695
or under-employed.

1666
01:25:11,862 --> 01:25:14,364
Because being under-employed
is just as dangerous.

1667
01:25:15,157 --> 01:25:17,659
So my family has gone through
the welfare system,

1668
01:25:17,826 --> 01:25:19,912
when it was Jobs Central, in the mid-80s,

1669
01:25:20,078 --> 01:25:23,207
I came through the job training
partnership program,

1670
01:25:23,373 --> 01:25:24,458
here at Jobs Central,

1671
01:25:24,625 --> 01:25:26,168
and I went to a secretary school.

1672
01:25:26,919 --> 01:25:30,547
Years later, I'm the executive assistant
to the president of the agency.

1673
01:25:30,714 --> 01:25:32,090
Interesting! [laughing]

1674
01:25:32,257 --> 01:25:34,259
<i>My mother used to tell me
<i>all the time that:</i></i>

1675
01:25:34,426 --> 01:25:36,678
<i>"Why do you always go for the underdog?"</i>

1676
01:25:36,845 --> 01:25:39,139
<i>It was because the underdog is
<i>who needed me.</i></i>

1677
01:25:39,306 --> 01:25:42,601
<i>People that don't have anything,
<i>that's who I have to fight for.</i></i>

1678
01:25:42,768 --> 01:25:44,895
<i>And that's who I have fought for
<i>my entire life.</i></i>

1679
01:25:45,437 --> 01:25:48,273
I started taking my children,
and telling my children:

1680
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:51,777
"The military is a good option,
I can't afford to have you go to college,

1681
01:25:51,944 --> 01:25:54,571
I cannot pay your way.
Financial aid will not help you."

1682
01:25:54,738 --> 01:25:57,407
So, I, as a mother,
started teaching my children

1683
01:25:57,574 --> 01:25:59,785
about the options
that the military could do.

1684
01:25:59,952 --> 01:26:02,955
That would take them around the world,
they would see all the things that I,

1685
01:26:03,121 --> 01:26:05,958
as a mother, could not let them see,
it would pay for their education

1686
01:26:06,124 --> 01:26:09,002
that I, as their mother,
and their father, could not pay for.

1687
01:26:09,419 --> 01:26:11,922
[Michael Moore] The military's
a good option for kids in Flint?

1688
01:26:12,089 --> 01:26:14,842
Military's an excellent option
for the people in the city of Flint.

1689
01:26:16,677 --> 01:26:20,055
[Michael Moore] How many have a friend
or a family member in the service?

1690
01:26:21,932 --> 01:26:24,351
Anybody currently serving overseas?

1691
01:26:24,518 --> 01:26:26,311
-Brother of mine.
-My cousin.

1692
01:26:26,478 --> 01:26:27,729
Yeah, a cousin.

1693
01:26:27,896 --> 01:26:29,773
-[Michael Moore] Where is your brother?
-Iraq.

1694
01:26:29,940 --> 01:26:31,233
Germany!

1695
01:26:31,942 --> 01:26:35,612
My cousin got shipped off to Iraq,
like, three days ago.

1696
01:26:36,321 --> 01:26:37,447
[Michael Moore] Alright!

1697
01:26:37,865 --> 01:26:41,118
There's, like, an army
or Navy recruiter or Marines recruiter

1698
01:26:41,285 --> 01:26:43,328
up there almost every week.

1699
01:26:44,037 --> 01:26:48,166
He's in the lunch room
recruiting students from the lunch room!

1700
01:26:49,001 --> 01:26:51,336
[dramatic male voice]
<i>There are people with a calling.</i>

1701
01:26:51,503 --> 01:26:55,966
[heroic music]

1702
01:26:56,133 --> 01:26:57,759
<i>Most serve one weekend a month</i>

1703
01:26:57,926 --> 01:26:59,761
<i>and two weeks a year.</i>

1704
01:26:59,928 --> 01:27:01,680
[heroic music intensifies]

1705
01:27:01,847 --> 01:27:03,432
<i>Earning money for college.</i>

1706
01:27:03,599 --> 01:27:06,310
[throbbing of rotor blades]

1707
01:27:07,394 --> 01:27:09,229
<i>Protecting their community.</i>

1708
01:27:10,981 --> 01:27:14,610
<i>In the Army National Guard, you can!</i>

1709
01:27:14,776 --> 01:27:17,946
[music ends dramatically]

1710
01:27:18,113 --> 01:27:19,615
I'm going into the Air Force myself.

1711
01:27:19,781 --> 01:27:22,784
I'm going to take a year off,
probably after high school,

1712
01:27:22,951 --> 01:27:26,246
and then make a career, I want to be
an aircraft maintenance technician.

1713
01:27:26,413 --> 01:27:29,583
I ran into a recruiter and, uh,
there was something I noticed about it,

1714
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:32,294
and this is kinda on another...
I noticed it was odd.

1715
01:27:32,461 --> 01:27:35,005
It was more like he was hiring me
for a job than recruiting me for the Army.

1716
01:27:35,172 --> 01:27:36,423
It was the way he approached me,

1717
01:27:36,590 --> 01:27:37,758
<i>he approached a friend of mine.</i>

1718
01:27:37,925 --> 01:27:40,093
<i>I was in Borders Books and Music,
<i>he just came up,</i></i>

1719
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:41,553
he handed us a business card.

1720
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:43,639
They have business cards
made for the Army.

1721
01:27:43,805 --> 01:27:49,061
[funky tune]

1722
01:27:49,228 --> 01:27:51,688
[Michael Moore]
<i>Meet Marine Staff Sergeant Dale Kortman</i>

1723
01:27:51,855 --> 01:27:53,774
<i>and Sergeant Raymond Plouhar.</i>

1724
01:27:55,108 --> 01:27:58,445
<i>They are two of the many recruiters
<i>assigned to Flint, Michigan.</i></i>

1725
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:01,615
<i>They're very busy these days.</i>

1726
01:28:01,782 --> 01:28:03,784
[Plouhar]
Look it, he's running away already.

1727
01:28:03,951 --> 01:28:05,285
He's seen us coming.

1728
01:28:05,452 --> 01:28:06,703
[Kortman] Yeah!

1729
01:28:07,329 --> 01:28:09,790
What we got here?
It's like a little gangster!

1730
01:28:09,957 --> 01:28:11,208
[Plouhar] Yeah!

1731
01:28:11,959 --> 01:28:14,044
[Kortman] We're heading over
to the Courtland mall right now.

1732
01:28:15,963 --> 01:28:19,132
[Michael Moore]<i> They decided not to go
<i>to the wealthier Genesee Valley mall</i></i>

1733
01:28:19,299 --> 01:28:23,345
<i>in the suburbs, they have a hard time
<i>recruiting young people there.</i></i>

1734
01:28:23,512 --> 01:28:26,515
<i>Instead, they went to the other mall.</i>

1735
01:28:26,849 --> 01:28:28,809
[Kortman]
Let's go in through Mervyns.

1736
01:28:28,976 --> 01:28:30,811
-In through Mervyns?
-And then, we'll walk--

1737
01:28:30,978 --> 01:28:33,355
-Straight down.
-Straight back and to the lunch room or--

1738
01:28:33,897 --> 01:28:35,983
[Kortman] Gents,
you know we're looking at you, right?

1739
01:28:36,149 --> 01:28:37,568
You guys ever think about joining up?

1740
01:28:37,734 --> 01:28:40,028
I thought about going to college
and playing basketball.

1741
01:28:40,195 --> 01:28:41,280
Okay, you any good?

1742
01:28:41,446 --> 01:28:42,447
-Yeah.
-Alright!

1743
01:28:42,614 --> 01:28:44,533
-Especially basketball.
-Good! You can play ball

1744
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:46,785
for the Marine corps,
you know, travel around the world,

1745
01:28:46,952 --> 01:28:48,453
get on the Marine Corps basketball team.

1746
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:50,372
David Robinson was
in the military as well.

1747
01:28:50,539 --> 01:28:52,749
-Oh, was he?
-So, yeah, you can definitely hook it up.

1748
01:28:52,916 --> 01:28:55,210
Right now there is somebody
out there who wants to be a Marine,

1749
01:28:55,377 --> 01:28:56,420
but has no idea how to do it.

1750
01:28:56,587 --> 01:28:59,047
-Where you work at?
-I work at KFC.

1751
01:28:59,214 --> 01:29:00,340
-Sweet!
-On Dort and Lapeer.

1752
01:29:00,507 --> 01:29:02,092
-You can hook us up with some deals!
-Yes!

1753
01:29:02,259 --> 01:29:03,427
They wait to get recruited.

1754
01:29:03,594 --> 01:29:06,471
I don't know, I was probably gonna start
to get a little career in music.

1755
01:29:06,638 --> 01:29:07,556
Career in music?

1756
01:29:07,723 --> 01:29:11,268
Maybe we can get you a career in music,
you know, let the Marines go for it.

1757
01:29:11,435 --> 01:29:12,853
I'm sure you know who Shaggy is, right?

1758
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:14,980
-[Montrey] <i>Yeah!
<i>-You know anything about him?</i></i>

1759
01:29:15,147 --> 01:29:17,191
-[Montrey] <i>Yeah, he Jamaican or something.
<i>-Yeah!</i></i>

1760
01:29:17,357 --> 01:29:18,901
How about a former Marine?

1761
01:29:19,985 --> 01:29:21,111
-Huh!
-Did you know it?

1762
01:29:21,278 --> 01:29:23,614
You need to know discipline
if you're gonna get into music.

1763
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:25,741
-Yeah, I--
-Especially discipline with the money.

1764
01:29:25,908 --> 01:29:27,492
-Right.
-When you make a million, you need

1765
01:29:27,659 --> 01:29:29,119
to manage that money,
so come in the office,

1766
01:29:29,286 --> 01:29:30,287
we can sit down and talk,

1767
01:29:30,454 --> 01:29:33,373
show you everything we know
about the Marines. Sound like a plan?

1768
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:35,751
What do you got going on this afternoon?
How about tomorrow?

1769
01:29:35,918 --> 01:29:37,920
We say around ten o'clock Monday morning?

1770
01:29:38,086 --> 01:29:39,546
-Yeah, that sounds pretty good.
-OK.

1771
01:29:39,713 --> 01:29:40,797
You want me to come pick you up?

1772
01:29:40,964 --> 01:29:42,591
Better to get them
when they're ones and twos.

1773
01:29:42,758 --> 01:29:45,427
-Hey, pal!
-And work on them that way.

1774
01:29:45,594 --> 01:29:46,803
Ladies, you're ready to join up?

1775
01:29:46,970 --> 01:29:49,056
Green hat behind us.

1776
01:29:49,223 --> 01:29:52,851
-Looks young. He's young.
-Yeah!

1777
01:29:53,018 --> 01:29:54,686
-Yeah.
-We got two over here.

1778
01:29:54,853 --> 01:29:57,314
-Yeah.
-Right over by the red van.

1779
01:29:57,481 --> 01:29:59,608
You go that way,
I go this way, we corner him.

1780
01:29:59,775 --> 01:30:01,610
-You're in the ninth grade?
-Yes, sir!

1781
01:30:01,777 --> 01:30:04,446
Man, you look older than ninth grade!

1782
01:30:04,613 --> 01:30:06,615
-Yes, sir!
-Alright, here's my card!

1783
01:30:06,782 --> 01:30:08,909
You ever thought about being a Marine,
man?

1784
01:30:09,076 --> 01:30:11,453
I thought about it,
I got a wife and kid now, so...

1785
01:30:11,620 --> 01:30:13,080
Even more reason to join now.

1786
01:30:13,247 --> 01:30:15,207
-What I want to do, man, real quick, is...
-Yes, sir!

1787
01:30:15,374 --> 01:30:18,001
Just get some information from you,
so I can scratch you off my list

1788
01:30:18,168 --> 01:30:20,379
saying I've talked to you,
and you know, you're not interested.

1789
01:30:20,546 --> 01:30:21,505
-Is that cool?
-Yeah!

1790
01:30:21,672 --> 01:30:22,714
Alright. What's your name?

1791
01:30:22,881 --> 01:30:24,466
Your phone number?

01:38:06,220 --> 01:38:10,474
we're trying to help these people
and it seems they don't want our help.

1952
01:38:10,641 --> 01:38:13,018
"Get out of here", but the minute
something goes wrong with them,

1953
01:38:13,185 --> 01:38:15,020
"Oh, why weren't you here?
Why didn't you do this?"

1954
01:38:15,187 --> 01:38:17,689
You know, it's...
I hate this country.

1955
01:38:18,815 --> 01:38:20,192
You know, you, you...

1956
01:38:20,359 --> 01:38:27,366
I feel that a part of your soul...
is destroyed in taking another life.

1957
01:38:28,617 --> 01:38:31,370
And, yes, that statement is very true,
you...

1958
01:38:32,454 --> 01:38:35,249
cannot kill someone
without killing a part of yourself.

1959
01:38:36,208 --> 01:38:38,418
[Michael Moore] If you get called up,
would you go back to Iraq?

1960
01:38:38,585 --> 01:38:39,670
No.

1961
01:38:39,837 --> 01:38:41,129
-You're not?
-No!

1962
01:38:41,588 --> 01:38:44,925
[Michael Moore] What repercussions
do you face, if you don't?

1963
01:38:45,092 --> 01:38:48,262
It's possible jail time,
that's one possibility.

1964
01:38:48,428 --> 01:38:49,555
Are you willing to risk that?

1965
01:38:49,721 --> 01:38:52,140
Yes. Yes, I...

1966
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:55,769
I will not let my person...

1967
01:38:58,188 --> 01:39:00,899
I will not let anyone

1968
01:39:01,567 --> 01:39:04,987
send me back over there
to kill other poor people.

1969
01:39:05,153 --> 01:39:10,117
especially when they pose no threat
to me and my country.

1970
01:39:14,955 --> 01:39:16,206
I won't do it.

1971
01:39:17,583 --> 01:39:21,545
This is an impressive crowd:
the haves, and the have-mores.

1972
01:39:21,712 --> 01:39:24,506
[crowd laughing]

1973
01:39:24,673 --> 01:39:26,717
Some people call you the elite.

1974
01:39:27,134 --> 01:39:28,385
I call you my base.

1975
01:39:28,552 --> 01:39:32,514
[crowd laughing and clapping]

1976
01:39:32,681 --> 01:39:35,809
[crowd cheering and whistling]

1977
01:39:35,976 --> 01:39:36,977
[military music]

1978
01:39:37,144 --> 01:39:39,688
[Michael Moore]<i> While Bush
<i>was busy taking care of his base</i></i>

1979
01:39:39,855 --> 01:39:42,024
<i>and professing his love for our troops,</i>

1980
01:39:42,191 --> 01:39:45,527
<i>he proposed cutting
<i>combat soldiers' pay by 33%.</i></i>

1981
01:39:45,694 --> 01:39:46,695
[clapping]

1982
01:39:46,862 --> 01:39:49,239
<i>And assistance to their families by 60%.</i>

1983
01:39:50,032 --> 01:39:52,618
<i>He opposed giving veterans
<i>a billion dollars more</i></i>

1984
01:39:52,784 --> 01:39:54,161
<i>in healthcare benefits.</i>

1985
01:39:54,912 --> 01:39:57,623
<i>And he supported
<i>closing veteran hospitals.</i></i>

1986
01:39:58,081 --> 01:40:00,792
<i>He tried to double
<i>the prescription drug costs for veterans</i></i>

1987
01:40:01,668 --> 01:40:04,713
<i>and opposed full benefits
<i>for part-time reservists.</i></i>

1988
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:06,507
[crowds applauding]

1989
01:40:06,673 --> 01:40:11,261
<i>And when staff Sergeant Brett Petriken
<i>from Flint was killed in Iraq on May 26,</i></i>

1990
01:40:11,428 --> 01:40:14,014
<i>the Army sent
<i>his last paycheck to his family,</i></i>

1991
01:40:14,181 --> 01:40:17,809
<i>but they docked him for the last five days
<i>of the month that he didn't work</i></i>

1992
01:40:17,976 --> 01:40:19,353
<i>because he was dead.</i>

1993
01:40:21,438 --> 01:40:24,525
They say they're not going to leave
any veteran behind, but they're leaving

1994
01:40:24,691 --> 01:40:27,027
<i>all kinds of veterans behind.</i>

1995
01:40:27,194 --> 01:40:30,822
To say that we're forgotten, no,
I know we're not forgotten, but missed?

1996
01:40:30,989 --> 01:40:34,493
Yes. Yes. You know, there are
a lot of soldiers that have been missed,

1997
01:40:34,660 --> 01:40:36,203
that have been skipped over,

1998
01:40:36,370 --> 01:40:38,914
that didn't get the proper coverage
that they deserved.

1999
01:40:39,081 --> 01:40:42,125
They have a death toll, but they're not
showing the amount of people

2000
01:40:42,292 --> 01:40:44,837
that have been injured or are amputated
because of their injuries, you know.

2001
01:40:45,587 --> 01:40:47,965
-Like, I still feel like I have hands.
-[Brian Williams] Yeah!

2002
01:40:48,131 --> 01:40:52,469
And the pain is like,
my hands are being crushed in a vice.

2003
01:40:52,636 --> 01:40:56,431
But they do a lot to help it,
and they take a lot of the edge off it,

2004
01:40:56,598 --> 01:40:59,351
and it makes it
a lot more tolerable and...

2005
01:40:59,977 --> 01:41:02,646
[soldier] <i>I was injured in late April,
<i>on patrol in Baghdad.</i></i>

2006
01:41:03,564 --> 01:41:06,817
Um... [sniffles]
a couple of guys came out.

2007
01:41:07,568 --> 01:41:09,152
Ambushed us.

2008
01:41:09,319 --> 01:41:13,866
I've got nerve damage and stuff like that,
and I've got a lot of pain,

2009
01:41:14,032 --> 01:41:15,784
I'm constantly in pain.

2010
01:41:16,451 --> 01:41:21,999
Um, I take a lot of morphine
to help with that stuff.

2011
01:41:23,458 --> 01:41:27,421
I'm doing... you know, just readjusting,

2012
01:41:27,588 --> 01:41:31,133
getting life back on track.

2013
01:41:31,300 --> 01:41:32,801
You know what I'm saying?

2014
01:41:32,968 --> 01:41:37,055
Yes. I'm not gonna do
what it is that I did before.

2015
01:41:37,639 --> 01:41:41,435
Um, I... I was a Republican
for quite a few years.

2016
01:41:41,602 --> 01:41:43,270
And, um...

2017
01:41:44,229 --> 01:41:46,690
For some reason, they...

2018
01:41:49,818 --> 01:41:52,362
They conduct business
in a very dishonest way.

2019
01:41:52,529 --> 01:41:53,822
I'm gonna be incredibly active

2020
01:41:53,989 --> 01:41:57,576
in the Democratic party
down where I live once I get out.

2021
01:41:57,743 --> 01:42:03,457
So, I'm gonna definitely do my best
to ensure that the Democrats win control.

2022
01:42:04,291 --> 01:42:07,961
Iraq, Baghdad, I didn't know
anything of those things.

2023
01:42:09,505 --> 01:42:12,758
And we were in the hallway
in the upstairs of our house,

2024
01:42:12,925 --> 01:42:15,177
<i>and he was crying,</i>

2025
01:42:15,344 --> 01:42:20,432
<i>he said that he was really scared
<i>and he didn't want to have to go to Iraq.</i></i>

2026
01:42:20,599 --> 01:42:24,144
We were able to have a whole conversation
about sometimes some fear is healthy,

2027
01:42:24,311 --> 01:42:26,230
because it keeps our senses about us.

2028
01:42:26,396 --> 01:42:29,483
<i>And that's when he told me that
<i>he had not told anybody else but he knew</i></i>

2029
01:42:29,650 --> 01:42:31,109
<i>he was going to Baghdad.</i>

2030
01:42:31,276 --> 01:42:33,237
-[Michael Moore] Wow!
-[baby crying]

2031
01:42:33,779 --> 01:42:37,324
As everybody,
we were glued to the TV.

2032
01:42:37,783 --> 01:42:41,245
Just glued, completely glued
to the television,

2033
01:42:41,411 --> 01:42:42,829
in hopes of seeing a glimpse of him.

2034
01:42:42,996 --> 01:42:45,082
"Can't you please go
to where the helicopters are,

2035
01:42:45,249 --> 01:42:47,459
can't you please let us see him?"

2036
01:42:47,626 --> 01:42:50,295
Then, that night,
it was about ten something,

2037
01:42:50,462 --> 01:42:52,840
I went upstairs to the bedroom,

2038
01:42:53,006 --> 01:42:56,677
I was lying in bed and I was flipping
the channels, all I heard was:

2039
01:42:56,844 --> 01:42:59,221
"Black Hawk down, South Central Iraq."

2040
01:42:59,638 --> 01:43:03,851
<i>All I can tell you at this hour is that
<i>last night the Army did indeed lose</i></i>

2041
01:43:04,017 --> 01:43:05,978
<i>a Black Hawk helicopter.</i>

2042
01:43:06,144 --> 01:43:08,480
<i>We are being told
<i>by officers on the ground</i></i>

2043
01:43:08,647 --> 01:43:11,358
<i>that there were six occupants
<i>inside the Black Hawk.</i></i>

2044
01:43:11,525 --> 01:43:14,027
[Lila Lipscomb] The next morning,
I got up and I said:

2045
01:43:14,194 --> 01:43:16,154
"You push those thoughts
out of your mind!

2046
01:43:16,321 --> 01:43:18,240
OK Jesus, I need you to come in,

2047
01:43:18,407 --> 01:43:20,367
I need you Jesus,
you gotta help me through this!"

2048
01:43:20,951 --> 01:43:22,202
The army called me,

2049
01:43:22,369 --> 01:43:26,874
I remember getting on the phone
and him asking me if I was Lila Lipscomb.

2050
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:30,419
I said yes and he said:
"Mother of Sergeant Michael Pedersen?"

2051
01:43:32,588 --> 01:43:34,965
[voice shaking]
And I remember dropping the telephone.

2052
01:43:37,634 --> 01:43:38,635
[sniffling]

2053
01:43:38,802 --> 01:43:41,763
And all I can honestly say
that I remember is:

2054
01:43:41,930 --> 01:43:42,848
"Ma'am!

2055
01:43:43,015 --> 01:43:48,020
The United States Army, the Secretary
of Defense regretfully informs you..."

2056
01:43:50,606 --> 01:43:51,523
That's all I know.

2057
01:43:53,942 --> 01:43:57,237
The grief grabbed me so hard

2058
01:43:57,905 --> 01:44:00,449
that I literally fell on the floor.

2059
01:44:00,616 --> 01:44:03,619
And I was alone,
I didn't have anybody to pick me up.

2060
01:44:04,119 --> 01:44:07,664
So I literally crawled over to my desk,

2061
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:11,585
and was hanging on,
and I remember screaming:

2062
01:44:12,127 --> 01:44:16,215
"Why does it have to be Michael?
Why did you have to take my son?

2063
01:44:16,715 --> 01:44:21,386
Why is it my son that you had to take?
He didn't do anything!

2064
01:44:21,845 --> 01:44:26,725
He wasn't a bad guy, he was a good guy,
why did you have to take my son?"

2065
01:44:26,892 --> 01:44:28,727
Uh, I, erm...

2066
01:44:28,894 --> 01:44:30,896
[stutters]

2067
01:44:31,063 --> 01:44:33,899
I can't imagine what it must be like
to lose a son or a daughter,

2068
01:44:34,066 --> 01:44:38,487
or a husband or a wife,
and I... it pains me.

2069
01:44:39,488 --> 01:44:40,739
[paper crumpling]

2070
01:44:40,906 --> 01:44:42,533
[Michael Moore]
You have his last letter?

2071
01:44:43,116 --> 01:44:44,826
And it was mailed March 16th

2072
01:44:45,619 --> 01:44:48,956
but I didn't get it until
about a week before he was killed.

2073
01:44:50,207 --> 01:44:55,254
"Hello. Hey mama, well,
sorry I haven't been able to call,

2074
01:44:55,420 --> 01:44:59,800
they took the phones seven days ago,
I got the letter and box,

2075
01:44:59,967 --> 01:45:03,095
that is so cool,
your first grandson came...

2076
01:45:03,262 --> 01:45:05,055
[heavy breathing]

2077
01:45:05,222 --> 01:45:07,850
... the same day your oldest son did.

2078
01:45:08,016 --> 01:45:10,394
How is everyone? I'm doing fine.

2079
01:45:10,561 --> 01:45:14,731
We are just out here in the sand
and windstorms, waiting.

2080
01:45:14,898 --> 01:45:20,654
What in the world is wrong with George
'trying to be like his dad' Bush?

2081
01:45:20,821 --> 01:45:23,699
He got us out here for nothing whatsoever.

2082
01:45:23,866 --> 01:45:26,660
I am so furious right now, Mama.

2083
01:45:27,870 --> 01:45:32,541
I really hope they do not
re-elect that fool, honestly.

2084
01:45:33,208 --> 01:45:36,003
I am in good spirits and I am doing OK.

2085
01:45:36,170 --> 01:45:37,880
I really miss you guys.

2086
01:45:38,046 --> 01:45:39,173
Thanks for the Bible...

[repressing tears]

2088
01:45:41,758 --> 01:45:44,261
... and books, and candy.

2089
01:45:44,428 --> 01:45:47,264
[voice shaking] I really look forward
to letters from you guys.

2090
01:45:48,849 --> 01:45:50,767
Well, tell all the family hello

2091
01:45:51,393 --> 01:45:53,145
and that I am doing fine.

2092
01:45:53,312 --> 01:45:56,732
We don't expect
anything to happen any time soon.

2093
01:45:56,899 --> 01:46:00,777
I cannot wait to get home
and get back to my life.

2094
01:46:01,278 --> 01:46:03,155
Tell Sputnik congrats.

2095
01:46:03,530 --> 01:46:06,617
And I'll see my first nephew soon,

2096
01:46:07,993 --> 01:46:10,078
as soon as I get back to the States.

2097
01:46:10,746 --> 01:46:13,040
Hope you guys are doing OK

2098
01:46:13,207 --> 01:46:15,167
and keep sending the mail.

2099
01:46:15,334 --> 01:46:18,045
It makes getting through the days easier.

2100
01:46:20,047 --> 01:46:21,131
[gulping]

2101
01:46:21,298 --> 01:46:27,095
Well, I am on my way to bed,
so I will write you guys soon.

2102
01:46:28,180 --> 01:46:31,475
[sobbing]
I love and miss all of you guys."

-"Love, Michael."
-[paper flapping]

2104
01:46:44,988 --> 01:46:46,823
I want him to be alive,

2105
01:46:47,533 --> 01:46:49,576
and I can't make him alive.

[sniffling]

2107
01:46:51,245 --> 01:46:53,372
But your flesh just aches.

2108
01:46:54,373 --> 01:46:56,834
You want your child, it's out of sync.

2109
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,838
A parent is not supposed
to bury their child.

01:47:11,557 --> 01:47:12,641
But...

2114
01:47:13,517 --> 01:47:16,645
I really feel sorry
for the other families

2115
01:47:16,812 --> 01:47:21,066
that is losing their kids as we speak.

2116
01:47:24,069 --> 01:47:25,612
And for what?

2117
01:47:25,779 --> 01:47:27,364
I don't...

2118
01:47:29,074 --> 01:47:33,203
That's the, I guess, sickening part.
For what?

2119
01:47:33,954 --> 01:47:35,956
You've heard a lot
about Halliburton lately.

2120
01:47:36,123 --> 01:47:41,086
Criticism is okay. We can take it.
Criticism is not failure.

2121
01:47:41,253 --> 01:47:43,422
Our employees are doing a great job.

2122
01:47:43,589 --> 01:47:46,717
<i>We're feeding the soldiers,
<i>we're rebuilding Iraq.</i></i>

2123
01:47:46,884 --> 01:47:50,012
Will things go wrong?
Sure they will, it's a war zone.

2124
01:47:50,179 --> 01:47:52,806
We're serving the troops
because of what we know,

2125
01:47:52,973 --> 01:47:54,266
not who we know.

2126
01:47:54,433 --> 01:47:57,519
Well, let me tell you about Halliburton,
the company I ran.

2127
01:47:57,686 --> 01:47:59,521
I'm very proud of what I did
at Halliburton,

2128
01:47:59,688 --> 01:48:02,566
the people of Halliburton are very proud
of what they've accomplished

2129
01:48:02,733 --> 01:48:04,276
and I frankly

2130
01:48:04,776 --> 01:48:08,113
don't feel any need to apologize
for the way I've spent my time

2131
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:11,074
over the last five years
as the C.E.O. and Chairman

2132
01:48:11,241 --> 01:48:12,951
of a major American corporation,
a good one.

2133
01:48:13,118 --> 01:48:16,121
This is also an attempt
to divert attention away from the fact

2134
01:48:16,288 --> 01:48:17,748
they have no energy policy.

2135
01:48:18,916 --> 01:48:22,002
And as the Secretary of Energy said,
we were caught unawares!

[Michael Mele]
<i>Having worked</i>

2142
01:48:37,768 --> 01:48:44,691
this, uh... effort
even since before the invasion,

2143
01:48:44,858 --> 01:48:47,152
the, uh, liberation of Iraq started.

2144
01:48:47,319 --> 01:48:52,157
You, industry, are definitely
a vital part of that effort.

2145
01:48:52,324 --> 01:48:55,410
We appreciate your interest in this.
We need you.

2146
01:48:55,577 --> 01:48:58,455
Now, lots of you are
small businesses and you are struggling.

2147
01:48:58,622 --> 01:49:00,457
How do we get a piece of this big action?

2148
01:49:00,624 --> 01:49:02,876
All of you, the big guys,
are going to get it and the rest of us

2149
01:49:03,043 --> 01:49:05,921
that have subcontracting capability,
or no, none at all.

2150
01:49:06,088 --> 01:49:08,549
U.S.T.V.A. is for you.

2151
01:49:08,715 --> 01:49:10,884
Once that oil start flowing
and money coming,

2152
01:49:11,051 --> 01:49:12,845
it's going to be lots of money,

2153
01:49:13,011 --> 01:49:15,138
it's the second largest oil reserve
in the world.

2154
01:49:15,305 --> 01:49:16,974
There's no question
about how much money is there.

2155
01:49:17,140 --> 01:49:21,603
I've been getting complaints
from Iraqi firms and from American firms,

2156
01:49:21,770 --> 01:49:24,690
that the lack of transparency,
the corruption...

2157
01:49:24,857 --> 01:49:27,276
I think the profits
that American companies are making,

2158
01:49:27,442 --> 01:49:29,111
the majors, the main companies,

2159
01:49:29,278 --> 01:49:31,238
are so overwhelming,

2160
01:49:31,405 --> 01:49:34,783
I mean, like when you have a line item
for a million dollars

2161
01:49:34,950 --> 01:49:38,245
and you subcontract it out
for 50 or 60 or 70 thousand dollars,

2162
01:49:38,412 --> 01:49:39,621
that's a huge profit,

2163
01:49:39,788 --> 01:49:41,999
and it's the American taxpayer
that's going to pay for that.

2164
01:49:42,165 --> 01:49:43,876
And it's going to get better!

2165
01:49:44,042 --> 01:49:47,546
Start building relationships
because it's going to get much better

2166
01:49:47,713 --> 01:49:49,631
as the oil flows
and their budget increase.

2167
01:49:49,798 --> 01:49:53,135
The good news is, whatever it costs,
the government will pay you.

2168
01:49:53,635 --> 01:49:56,138
War is always good for certain companies

2169
01:49:56,305 --> 01:49:58,515
that are in the war,
the business of war.

2171
01:50:01,518 --> 01:50:04,479

and the U.S. military,

2173
01:50:06,106 --> 01:50:08,609
and the real heroes of the campaign,
the real heroes of the reconstruction,

2174
01:50:08,775 --> 01:50:11,653
are the men and women
of the U.S. Armed Forces,

2175
01:50:11,820 --> 01:50:14,239

how Halliburton got another contract.

2183
01:50:35,552 --> 01:50:38,472
-Halliburton got another contract!
-That's right!

2184
01:50:38,639 --> 01:50:41,308
Which is not being...

2185
01:50:42,476 --> 01:50:43,852
contested at all!

[gentle guitar music]

2278
01:55:20,420 --> 01:55:24,424
[Michael Moore]<i> I guess I was tired of
<i>seeing people like Lila Lipscomb suffer.</i></i>

2279
01:55:24,591 --> 01:55:28,554
<i>Especially when,
<i>out of the 535 members of Congress,</i></i>

2280
01:55:29,304 --> 01:55:32,558
<i>only one had an enlisted son in Iraq.</i>

2281
01:55:36,270 --> 01:55:38,730
<i>I asked Corporal Henderson
<i>of the United States Marine Corps</i></i>

2282
01:55:38,897 --> 01:55:40,774
<i>to join me on Capitol Hill</i>

2283
01:55:40,941 --> 01:55:44,570
<i>to see how many members of Congress
<i>we could convince</i></i>

2284
01:55:44,736 --> 01:55:47,155
<i>to enlist their children to go to Iraq.</i>

2285
01:55:47,322 --> 01:55:49,032
Congressman, I'm Michael Moore.

2286
01:55:49,199 --> 01:55:51,869
Hey Michael, how are you doing?
I'm good, John Tanner.

2287
01:55:52,035 --> 01:55:54,538
Yeah, nice to meet you,
very nice to meet you.

2288
01:55:54,705 --> 01:55:56,874
-What are you doing?
-Well, I'm here with Cpl. Henderson.

2289
01:55:57,040 --> 01:56:00,043
-U.S. Marine Corps.
-Corporal, I was in the Navy years ago.

2290
01:56:00,210 --> 01:56:03,046
-Okay, Sir!
-1968 to 72.

2291
01:56:03,213 --> 01:56:05,090
We had Marines guarding the base.

2292
01:56:05,257 --> 01:56:07,092
-[Moore] You have kids?
-[Tanner] Yeah.

2293
01:56:07,259 --> 01:56:11,180
Is here anyway we can get them to enlist
and go over and help out with the effort?

2294
01:56:11,346 --> 01:56:12,681
I have all the brochures.

2295
01:56:12,848 --> 01:56:14,474
One of them got two children.

2296
01:56:15,267 --> 01:56:16,602
Oh, oh, well!

2297
01:56:16,768 --> 01:56:19,188
See, there's not that many Congressmen
that've got kids over there.

2298
01:56:19,354 --> 01:56:20,814
And in fact, only one.

2299
01:56:20,981 --> 01:56:25,986
So we just thought maybe you guys
should send your kids there first.

2300
01:56:26,153 --> 01:56:27,946
What do you think about that idea?

2301
01:56:28,113 --> 01:56:30,115
-I don't disagree with you.
-Oh, you don't?

2302
01:56:30,282 --> 01:56:32,618
Oh good, well, here,
take some brochures then, here.

2303
01:56:32,784 --> 01:56:35,037
At least take a Marine brochure,
and pass it around.

2304
01:56:35,204 --> 01:56:36,121
Yeah!

2305
01:56:36,288 --> 01:56:39,625
Encourage fellow members,
if they're for the war, to get behind it,

2306
01:56:39,791 --> 01:56:41,043
and send their own!

2307
01:56:41,210 --> 01:56:43,670
-Thank you, Mike.
-Thank you, Sir, thank you very much.

2308

Congressman! Michael Moore.

2309
01:56:47,716 --> 01:56:48,967
-How are you doing?
-Good, good!

2310
01:56:49,134 --> 01:56:53,138
I'm trying to get members of Congress
to get their kids to enlist in the Army

2311
01:56:53,305 --> 01:56:54,806

Congressman Castle!

Congressman! Congressman!

-Congressman Doolittle, Michael Moore!
-Ah, no, no, no!

2316
01:57:07,110 --> 01:57:08,320
I'm wondering if...

[theme song]

2318
01:57:11,114 --> 01:57:12,991
Is there any way that...

2319
01:57:14,660 --> 01:57:15,786
Uh!

2320
01:57:15,953 --> 01:57:19,831
<i>Of course, not a single member of Congress
<i>wanted to sacrifice their child</i></i>

2321
01:57:19,998 --> 01:57:21,500
<i>for the war in Iraq.</i>

2322
01:57:22,084 --> 01:57:23,210
<i>And who could blame them?</i>

2323
01:57:23,377 --> 01:57:24,253
[music intensifies]

2324
01:57:24,419 --> 01:57:27,548
<i>Who would want to give up their child.
<i>Would you?</i></i>

2325
01:57:28,590 --> 01:57:29,716
<i>Would he?</i>

2326
01:57:32,469 --> 01:57:34,304
<i>I've always been amazed
<i>that the very people</i></i>

2327

<i>forced to live in the worst parts of town,
<i>go to the worst schools</i></i>

2328

<i>and who have it the hardest,</i>

2329
01:57:41,436 --> 01:57:45,023
<i>are always the first to step up
<i>to defend that very system.</i></i>

2330
01:57:45,941 --> 01:57:48,902
<i>They serve so that we don't have to.</i>

2331
01:57:49,528 --> 01:57:51,530
<i>They offer to give up their lives</i>

2332
01:57:52,197 --> 01:57:54,157
<i>so that we can be free.</i>

2333
01:57:55,242 --> 01:57:57,786
<i>It is remarkable, their gift to us.</i>

2334
01:57:58,787 --> 01:58:00,789
<i>And all they ask for in return,</i>

2335
01:58:01,957 --> 01:58:04,543
<i>is that we never send them
<i>into harm's way.</i></i>

2336
01:58:05,252 --> 01:58:08,172
<i>Unless it's absolutely necessary.</i>

2337
01:58:10,132 --> 01:58:12,467
<i>Will they ever trust us again?</i>

He had used weapons.

2339
01:58:15,888 --> 01:58:17,014
We know where they are,

2340
01:58:17,181 --> 01:58:19,683
they're in the area
around Tikrit and Baghdad,

2341
01:58:19,850 --> 01:58:21,602
and East, West, South, and North.

2342
01:58:21,768 --> 01:58:26,064
There is a tie between Iraq
and what happened on 9/11.

2343
01:58:26,565 --> 01:58:31,320
The struggle can only end with
their complete and permanent destruction.

2344
01:58:31,486 --> 01:58:34,948
We waged a war
to save a civilization itself.

2345
01:58:36,783 --> 01:58:38,368
We did not seek it,

2346
01:58:39,453 --> 01:58:42,623
but we will fight it, and we will prevail.

<i>George Orwell once wrote</i>

2348
01:58:45,667 --> 01:58:50,255
<i>that it's not a matter of whether the war
<i>is not real or if it is.</i></i>

2349
01:58:50,714 --> 01:58:52,549
<i>Victory is not possible.</i>

2350
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:56,094
<i>The war is not meant to be won.</i>

2351
01:58:56,261 --> 01:58:58,222
<i>It is meant to be continuous.</i>

2352
01:58:59,598 --> 01:59:04,645
<i>A hierarchical society is only possible
<i>on the basis of poverty and ignorance.</i></i>

<i>This new version is the past</i>

2354
01:59:08,482 --> 01:59:10,984
<i>and no different past
<i>can ever have existed.</i></i>

2355
01:59:13,570 --> 01:59:14,655
<i>In principle, the war effort</i>

2356
01:59:14,821 --> 01:59:18,909
<i>is always planned to keep society
<i>on the brink of starvation.</i></i>

2357
01:59:19,326 --> 01:59:22,412
<i>The war is waged by the ruling group
<i>against its own subjects,</i></i>

2358
01:59:23,705 --> 01:59:25,415
<i>and its object is not the victory</i>

2359

<i>over either Eurasia
<i>or East Asia,</i></i>

2360

<i>but to keep
<i>the very structure of society intact.</i></i>

There's an old saying in Tennessee,

2362
01:59:35,342 --> 01:59:36,927
I know it's in Texas,
probably in Tennessee,

2363
01:59:37,094 --> 01:59:38,887
