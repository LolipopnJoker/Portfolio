01:05:10,114 --> 01:05:13,492
I can't go. I can't abandon these guys.

996
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:16,119
They need me to get into this museum.

997
01:05:16,204 --> 01:05:19,998
Without me, they'll go back
into storage. Maybe forever!

998
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:23,710
Woody, you're not a collector's item.
You're a child's plaything.

999
01:05:23,795 --> 01:05:26,255
You are a toy!

1000
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:29,925
For how much longer? One more rip,
and Andy's done with me.

1001
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:32,803
And what do I do then, Buzz?
Huh? You tell me.

1002
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:35,764
Somewhere in that pad of stuffing
is a toy who taught me

1003
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:39,518
that life's only worth living
if you're bein' loved by a kid.

1004
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:42,563
And I traveled all this way
to rescue that toy

1005
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:44,606
because I believed him.

1006
01:05:45,567 --> 01:05:48,151

1010
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:07,713
Then we'd better make sure
we're there waiting for him.

1011
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:20,475
I don't have a choice, Buzz.
This is my only chance.

1012
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:21,977
To do what, Woody?

1013
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:25,397
