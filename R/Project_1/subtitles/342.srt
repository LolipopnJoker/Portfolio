Nah, man. It ain't fun.

24

I'm telling you,
once the humans bring a kid home,

[Max] Now, I thought I never had to worry
about any of that,

30

had a kid of their own.

His name's Liam.

[Liam cooing]

51
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,156
At first, he slept all the time.

52
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:40,034
Dreaming about, you know,
whatever it is that babies dream about.

53
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,661
Who's a cute little baby?

54
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:42,829
[Max] He had his place...

55

-You little cutie pie.
-[Chuck cooing]

56
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,290

like they were gonna be fine.

-[Liam babbling loudly]
-What?

59
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,008

[grunts]

61
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,474

[whimpers]

63
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,311
Sort of.

64
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,398

[Liam laughing]

68
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,322

[Max] But then one day,

73
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:30,668
Liam did something I never expected.

74
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:31,836
Max!

75
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,089

...everything was different.

78
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,643

like role models to him.

[Max and Duke laugh]

80
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,148

Whoa! [grunts]

86
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,129

91
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,974
[Max] And by the way,
I'm still not a kid person.

92
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,269
I'm talking about this kid.
This is my kid.

93
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,229
He's perfect.

94
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,483
And I'm never gonna let
anything bad happen to him.

95
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:40,947
But I got to say,
keeping Liam safe is a full-time job.

You know,
she writes her answers down in ink.

184
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,976
That's how confident she is.

185
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,228
That sounds really smart,

186
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,188
but you know what?
Liam is smart too.

187
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,148
In fact, I heard Katie say

188
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,236
that Liam's head circumference
is in the 80th percentile.

189
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,030
Oh, that's cool. That's a lot of head.

190
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,741
Hey, quick question.
Is he still peeing everywhere?

191
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,076
Can't control his bladder?

192
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,453
Yeah, he's-he's peeing.

193
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,163
But every pet knows,

194
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,832
if you pee on it, you own it.

195
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,209
And Liam, he's just thinking ahead.

196
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,711
Yeah, well, you still better train him

197
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:47,920
before preschool starts.

198
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,881
You don't want Liam to get a reputation
as one of those pee-pee kids.

199
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,718
Yeah, totally! Wait, preschool?

200
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,428
Yeah. He's around that age.

201
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,097
The baby bird is leaving the nest, TD.

202
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,933
No, no. Baby bird is staying put.

203
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,311
He doesn't need preschool.
He'll, you know, [grunts]

204
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,272
stay home, with me, where it's safe.

[Duke] Hey, Max.

206
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,776
It's, uh, no big deal,
no need to overreact,

207
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,945
but, uh, Liam just left.

208
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,697
Wait, what? Where did he go?

209
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,657
I don't know.
They never tell the dog specifics.

-Okay. Keep--

219
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,638

Why would he be in a bag of chips?

was being held against his will.

00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,790
[laughing] Okay.

533
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,041
-Yeah, I get it. You made your point.
-[Max sighs]

534
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:44,751
Oh, look! I'm peeing on a tree.

535
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,670
-Okay. Yeah, great. Leaving now.
-I now own this tree.

536
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,046
-All right.
-I guess I'll just stare at the door

537
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,381
until you come back.

538
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:50,966
[Max] Oh, I miss New York.

539
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:53,802
[Duke] Maybe a break from the city
is just what you need.

540
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,053
This place is...

541
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:57,931
What?

542
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,687
[snarling]

-[gobbling]

544
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:09,859
[Max] No, no, no!

545
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:11,987
[screams]

546
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,698
Duke! What did I do? What did I do?

547
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:17,617
[howls]

548
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,744
-[gobbles]
-[mooing]

549
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:20,996
Huh?

550
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,539
[growling]

551
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:26,334
[gobbling]

552
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,087
Whoa.

553

-[triangle tinkling]
-[gasps]

554
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:36,052
Dinner's on!

555
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,894
Chloe! I need your help!

556
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,229
[whispering] Chloe.

557
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,440
Oh. Uh... Oh.

558
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:49,524
Uh...

559
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:52,485
Chloe? Chloe, are you okay?

560
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:53,862
Shh.

561
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,990
Sorry. Uh, I'm just-- I'm-- [sighs]

562
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,826
Real quick.
Why is there a lampshade on your head?

563
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:03,121
[chuckles] Listen, Gidget, baby.

564
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,706
I got to be honest with you.

565
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:09,377
My owner might have given me
a little bit of catnip.

566
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,379
[chuckling] Whoa.

567
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:12,839
[laughing]

568
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,008
Oh, okay. Gotcha. That's great.

569
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:17,469
-Um, listen.
-It is great, Gidget.

570
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:20,513
-Everything is great.
-All right.

571
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:21,431
[purring]

572
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:23,558
-Do you hear that?
-Hear what?

573
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,019
It's like a tiny... Uh, like a tiny motor.

574
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:26,978
[purring]

575
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:27,937
It's like a humming sound.

576
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,358
-[purring continues]
-I'm not-- Don't know what you're--

577
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,194
Oh, Chloe, you're purring. [chuckles]

578
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:37,322
-That's you.
-What? That's me?

579
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,158
Like, as in the sound
is coming from inside of me?

580
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:41,493
-Yep.
-Oh.

581
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:43,995
I wonder what other sounds I could make.

582
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:45,622
[meows]

583
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,125
It's just, Max trusted me
to look after his Busy Bee, and then...

584
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,251
[purrs loudly]

585
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,836
Uh, Chloe, would you listen?

586
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,047
[meowing]

587
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:55,340
Wow, please stop.

588
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:57,258
[growling]

589
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:01,805
Are you finished?

590
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,098
[squeaks]

591
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:06,434
This is important! I lost Busy Bee.

592
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:10,438
I got to get it back,
but to do that, Chloe,

593
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:15,443
[sighs] I need you
to teach me the way of the cat.

594
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,072
[grunts]

595
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,698
Here we go. I'm gonna get you.

596
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,867
[grunting]

597
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:27,455
-[barking]
-[Uncle Shep chuckles]

598
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,583
-Max! Come on. Try to catch a firefly.
-I'm just--

599
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,586
That sounds great,
but I think Liam wants me near him.

600
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,255
-You know, he's a little freaked out...
-[sighs]

601
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:37,006
...being in this weird place.

602
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:39,259
I think he'll be okay.

603
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,469
-And this one is a jumper.
-[panting]

604
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,389
-Oh, okay. Just one.
-[chuckling]

605
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,725
-[grunting]
-[chuckling]

606
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,852
Yes! I-- [spits]

607
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,229
[groaning, exclaims]

608
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,314
[gasps]

609
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,650
[blabbering]

610
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,238
[dog growling]

611
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:04,367
[exclaims] Oh, hello.

612
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:07,078
Dog's got two things in this life.

613
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,831
His water bowl and his dignity.

614
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,709
You take one, you take the other.

615
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,712
I, uh... I didn't know this was your bowl.

616
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,589
What? The cone blocking your view?

617
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:19,632
It's got my name on the side.

618
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,928
We are so sorry, Mr. Chicken.

619
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,430
Name's not Chicken.

620
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,182
Do I look like a Chicken to you?

621
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,476
-No. No, sir.
-No, not... Not even a little.

622
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:31,770
Name's Rooster.

623
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,897
Oh, okay. I'm Max and this is--

624
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,899
Hey, what's that kid doing in the cage?

625
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,777
Something wrong with him?
He's got the fever?

626
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,111
-[cooing]
-[croaks]

627
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:43,031
That's-That's Liam. He-He likes to run.

628
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:46,409
-So, let him run.
-Well, Liam's super-fast.

629
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:48,620
[chuckling] We blink and he's up a tree.

630
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,331
So then, your kid's up a tree.
What's the problem?

631
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,374
-Well, he could fall.
-He might.

632
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,501
And then he hurts himself.

633
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:57,837
Oh, so, he got really high up
in this hypothetical tree?

634
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:58,922
I--

635
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:01,049
Kid gets hurt,
he learns not to do it again.

636
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,343
You know how many
electric cords I've chewed?

637
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,012
Like, multiple cords?

638
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,140
One. It shocked me.

639
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:12,852
I walked backward for a week,
but I never chewed a cord again.

640
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:16,523
Well, that is great for you,
and it explains a lot,

641
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:20,693
but I like to protect Liam
from everything.

642
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:24,405
[scoffs] Well, that's you.
And you're wrong.

643
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:30,787
-[scoffs] Can you believe that guy?
-Yeah. He was cool!

644
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:34,374
-No, he wasn't.
-I know. He wasn't cool at all.

645
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:37,794
Come on.

646
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,712
[Chuck] Let's get this guy inside.

647
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,506
[Katie] Thanks.

648
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:46,261
Whoa, hold up there. Dogs sleep outside.

649
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:48,304
-Uh, pardon?
-Huh?

650
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,056
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

651
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:52,809
Okay. Wait, wait.
Let's talk about this like rational--

652
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,860
All right, we're here.

653
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,863
In record time, too,
thanks to the Bunnymobile.

654
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,447
Oh, yeah!

655
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,534

You are jumpy.

662
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:35,727
I meant... [screams] That's cool!

663
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,270
Or... [screams]

664
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,188
Look at that thing
I'm not scared of right there.

665
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:42,108
Or... [screams]
There's a candy wrapper on the ground.

666
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,402
See? It's just a thing I do.

Come on.

[whimpers]

682
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,904
We try again tomorrow.

683
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:32,283
If tiger does not do trick,
tiger will become rug.

685
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:38,206

It's okay, Hu.

689

It's me, Daisy. From the plane.

Hey! Step away from the tiger.

00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,469
[all] To get what I want, when I want it.

884
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,721
Okay, now, Pops' quiz!

885
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:58,766
Myron has hidden socks all over the room.

886
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:01,143
Now, what do we do with human socks?

887
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,522
-Ooh! Me, me!
-Go ahead, Princess.

888
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:08,234
-We hide them, Mr. Pops.
-Correct-a-rooney!

889
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,444
And why do we do hide them?

890
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:15,533
Not knowing where one sock is
messes with the humans' minds.

891
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,244
Heck yes, it does!
Always keep them guessing!

892
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,037
Now, go find those socks!

893
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:23,499
What? Okay, all right. Okay.
Hey, Pops! What...

894
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:25,751
Okay, that's enough. Hey. What's going on?

895
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:28,170
Yeah. My owner got a new puppy.

896
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,214
My name's Tiny!

897
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:31,715
Nobody cares!

898
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:34,760
I was teaching Tiny
how not to be anyone's sucker.

899
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:35,678
Word got out,

900
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:39,139
suddenly, every puppy in the tri-state
area is scratching at my door.

901
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:41,100
Yeah. Oh!

902
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:43,644
-Professor Pops?
-Yes, Pickles?

903
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:45,312
I gotta make a poop.

904
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:48,649
Oh! You know where to do that.
Find a shoe.

905
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:50,526
-[chuckles]
-[laughs]

906
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:51,902
This is so sweet.

907
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,195
-Yeah, they're good--
-[Hu growls]

908
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,614
Holy cheese and crackers! What is that?

909
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,908
Myron! Horn!

910
00:42:58,617 --> 00:42:59,660
[air horn blares]

911
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,294
No, no, no! Look, look. It's okay!

912
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,462
This beautiful creature is Hu,

913
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:12,506
and the good news

914
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:15,217
is he's staying with you!

915
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,719
Get that tiger out of here

916
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:18,387
before he does any more damage!

917
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,097
But we don't have
anywhere else to take him!

918
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,682
Well, he ain't staying here!

919
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:24,101
[puppies] Kitty, kitty, kitty!

920
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,728
Don't get attached!

921
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:27,479
That thing is out!

922
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,398
[all] Aww.

923
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:34,236
Oh! Pickles, did you poop in a shoe?

924
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,946
I pooped in a boot!

925
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:38,157
Your owner won't find it for weeks!

926
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,366
[chuckles]

927
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,368
[sniffling]

928
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:44,455
-Are you crying?
-What? No! You're crying!

929
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:48,667
But I'm just so proud of Pickles.

930
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:49,918
[clears throat]

931
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:53,714
Mr. Pops, please,
can the tiger stay with us?

932
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:54,923
Please?

933
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,176
[all] Please?

-Argh!

935

[Pops] Oh, flap-doodle!

938
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,771
Okay, fine, one night.

939

[wolves whimpering]

947
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:36,632
I give wolves one job.

948
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:41,970
Guard white tiger.
And you wolves, you blow it.

949
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:47,142
Maybe I should make juggling
monkey head of security.

950
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,936
What say you, Little Sergei?

952
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:53,107
Yes, you are so smart.

953
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:56,402
And then there's this one.

954
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,654
-You're the worst wolf ever.

Oh, I'm sorry, Liam. We can't read.

Well, wait a sec.

there's a little girl in a red hood,

979
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,605
skipping through the forest
[gasps] with some food.

980

[mimics munching]

982
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:22,779
[Max] And look at that.
She brought the food over to...

983
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,657
Hmm. Say, who is that?

984
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:27,534
Oh! Looks like her grandma!

985
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,746
Oh, I'll bet you're right.
Oh, that is sweet. She...

[Max and Duke scream]

987
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,041
So, Grandma had a pet wolf!

988
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:35,751
They had a great visit,
the little girl went home.

989
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:37,503
No one got eaten. The end!
[laughs nervously]

990

[Rooster] No, no, no.

991

That's not how the story goes.

992
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:41,882
Oh, we got this, thanks.

993
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,343
That wolf was gonna eat the little girl.

994
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:45,886
Nope! Thank you, Rooster!

995
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:47,930
-He already ate Grandma...
-[Max groans]

996
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:50,516

-[gasps] No!
-Hey! Don't freak out my kid.

Hyah!

1065
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,640
[Rooster barking] Get in there! Faster!

1066
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:20,600
Max, did you see that?

1067
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:23,311
-Uh, yeah.
-So cool!

1068
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:25,147
Oh, it's not that big a deal.

1069

[Rooster grunting]

1070
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:30,444
Move! Hyah!

1071
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:32,279
Move it!

1072
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,244
Oh, man!

1073
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:47,711
Hey, look. That big guy got out.

1074
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:49,045
We better get Rooster.

1075
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:51,882
No, no. No need for that. I can handle it.

1076
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:56,011
Hey, mister! Back inside! Come on!

1077
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,763
Yep!

1078
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,556
-[grunting]
-You're doing great!

1079
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,391
Go underneath him!

1080
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:02,934
Let's go!

1081
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,394
I think he moved a little!

1082
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:08,231
Don't you ignore me.

1086
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:17,866
[Duke] Yep. Uh-huh.
Now go and do the front. No! No, back.

1087
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:19,034
Now go to the side.

1088
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:22,871
Max, Rooster nips at the cows
to get them to move.

1089
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:23,955
Really?

1090
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:25,665
That sounds drastic, but...

1091
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,959
Okay, pig, you asked for this.

1092
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:29,377
[squealing loudly]

1093

-What's going on?
-Don't worry. I'm fine.

1100

-You let all the sheep out!
-I did?

1101
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:50,232
Hey!

1102
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,693
Get back in there. Come on.

1103
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,737
Wait a minute. Where's Cotton?

1104
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,906
Oh, he went into the woods.

1106
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:01,451
You. Come with me.

1107

Where are we going?

1108
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:05,497
We're gonna go get Cotton back.

1109
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:07,415
Oh. Great.

-Duke, sit!
-Yep.

1112
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:13,380
This is just you and me.

1113
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:14,673
Oh, boy.

1114
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:16,633
Come on.

1115

1121
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:32,858
Come on. Hurry up!

1122
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,361
Uh...

1123
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:37,612
Okay.

1124
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:39,239
[Rooster] Just jump!

[groans]

1131
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:56,298
Oh, boy.

1132
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,426
I can do this.

1134
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:02,679

1139
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:14,816
You know what? Just go on without me.

1140
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:16,735
-Oh, you're not giving up.
-Yeah, but...

1143
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:29,080
[echoing] Cotton,
what are you doing down there?

1144
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:31,750
There's apples in this tree!

1145
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:34,794
All right, just don't panic.

1146
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:36,546
Oh, man.

1147
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,758
-Max is coming down to save you.
-Wait, what?

1148
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:43,303
That tree can't support my weight.
You get down there.

1149

[eagle screeches]

1150
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:51,269
[stammers] I can't do that.

1151
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:52,729
Sure you can.

1152
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:55,482
Think of this as a game of fetch.

1153
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:58,068
Now, go fetch the sheep.

1154
00:53:58,234 --> 00:53:59,819
No, no, no.

1155
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,488
[stammering] It's too high

1156
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:03,907
and I'm too afraid.

1157
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,242
Max, here's a trick.

1158
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:11,539
The first step of not being afraid
is acting like you're not afraid.

1159
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:13,500
[chuckles nervously]

1160
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,752
So, are you scared?

1161
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:19,047
-No.
-Are you scared?

1162
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:22,008
No! No, I'm not!

1163
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,386
Now you're talking! Go get Cotton!

1165
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:28,223
Okay. Okay.

1166
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:30,350

Listen, uh, Cotton, walk toward me, okay?

1173
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:54,499
Okay, sure! But my leg is stuck.

1174
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:57,627
His leg is stuck!

1175
00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:59,254
Well, unstuck it.

Max!

1205
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:34,224
-Get back in your pen, Cotton.
-Okay!

1206
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:36,518
-No. Other way, Cotton.
-Okay!

[humming]

1208
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:41,439
So, how did it go? What happened?

1209
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:44,651
You know, it was pretty intense!
Tell him, Rooster!

1210
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,445
You know, some stuff happened.

1211
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:48,947
Now it's over.

1212
00:56:49,405 --> 00:56:50,824
Wow!

00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:53,034
He can really tell a story.

[wolves growling]

1219
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:12,470
So there I was,
surrounded by nasty wolves.

1220
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:15,932
-You asking was I scared?
-No one asked anything.

1221
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:18,101
You just walked up to us
and started talking.

1222
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:22,355
I was scared,
but I saved that tiger anyway.

1223
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:25,984
Am I a hero? That's not for me to say.

1224
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:29,529
-Boo-Boo? Boo-Boo, are you listening?
-I am.

1225
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:33,741
Stop digging for a second, Boo-Boo,
and maybe you'll learn something.

1226
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:35,326
As I was saying...
