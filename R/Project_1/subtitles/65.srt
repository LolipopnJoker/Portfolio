1
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,958
Things are never gonna be
the same now.

2
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,169
I mean, look at this.

3
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:46,379
You got aliens.

4
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,799
You got big green guys
tearing down buildings.

5
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:53,261
When I was a kid,
I used to draw cowboys and Indians.

6
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:56,973
Actually, it's Native American,
but whatever.

7
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:59,934
Yeah. Tell you what, though.

8
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,520
It ain't bad, is it?

9
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,439
No. Yeah.

10
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,483
Kid's got a future.

11
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,443
Yeah, well...

12
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:10,737
...we'll see, I guess.

13
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:36,513
No, hey!

14
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,099
You can't saw through that stuff.

15
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,102
These alien bastards are tough.

16
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,229
You gotta use the stuff they use.

17
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:49,234
- See? All right.
- All right.

18
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,737
Oh, hey!

19
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,198
Glad you could join us. Afternoon.

20
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,617
- Yeah. My alarm didn't go off.
- Yeah, your alarm.

21
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,495
Look, just go stack
that armor plating like I asked you.

22
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,455
This is a huge deal for us.

23
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,082
Attention, please!

24
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:07,085
In accordance
with Executive Order 396B...

25
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:10,797
...all post-battle cleanup operations
are now under our jurisdiction.

26
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,049
Thank you for your service.
We'll take it from here.

27
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,509
Who the hell are you?

28
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,136
Qualified personnel.

29
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:20,640
Look, I have a city contract to salvage
all this, okay, with the city, so...

30
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:25,395
I apologize, Mr. Toomes, but all salvage
operations are now under our jurisdiction.

31
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,857
Please turn over any and all
exotic materials that you've collected...

32
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:30,358
...or you will be prosecuted.

33
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,485
Ma'am, what am...?

34
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,530
Please. Come here.
Hey, lady, come on.

35
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,282
Look...

36
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,951
...I bought trucks for this job.

37
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,494
I brought in a whole new crew.

38
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,164
These guys have a family.
I have a family.

39
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,458
I'm all in on this. I could lose my house.

40
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:49,961
I'm sorry, sir. There's nothing I can do.

41
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,255
Maybe next time,
don't overextend yourself.

42
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,467
What'd you say?

43
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,012
Yeah.

44
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,848
He's right. I overextended myself.

45
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,684
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Don't do it.

46
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,354
Put them down.

47
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:12,442
If you have a grievance,
you may take it up with my superiors.

48
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,403
Your superiors. Who the hell are they?

49
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,198
<i>A joint venture between Stark Industries
and the government...</i>

50
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:21,005
<i>...the Department of Damage Control,
will oversee the collection...</i>

51
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:24,162
<i>...and storage of alien
and other exotic materials.</i>

52
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,123
Now the assholes who made this mess
are paid to clean it up.

53
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,541
Yeah, it's all rigged.

54
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,295
<i>Experts estimate there are
over 1500 tons of exotic material...</i>

55
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,464
<i>...scattered throughout the tri-state area.</i>

56
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,299
Hey, chief!

57
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,969
We have another load from yesterday.
We're supposed to turn this in, right?

58
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,179
I ain't hauling it.

59
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,555
It's too bad.

60
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,642
We could have made some cool stuff
from all that alien junk.

61
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,938
I tell you what.

62
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,190
Let's keep it.

63
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,360
The world's changing.

64
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,950
It's time we change, too.

65
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,163
There you go, Mason.

66
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,170
Business is good.

67
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,295
New York. Queens.

68
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,924
- It's a rough borough, but, hey, it's home.
- Who you talking to?

69
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,259
No one. Just making
a little video of the trip.

70
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,845
- You know you can't show it to anyone.
- Yeah, I know.

71
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,847
Then why are you narrating
in that voice?

72
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,600
- Because it's fun.
- Fun.

73
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,770
So why do they call you Happy?

74
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,608
Come on.
I'm not carrying your bags. Let's go.

75
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,694
Hey, should I go
to the bathroom before?

76
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,028
There's a bathroom on it.

77
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,322
No pilot? That's awesome.

78
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,075
- Is that where you're gonna sit?
- Yeah.

79
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:09,244
This is your first time
on a private plane?

80
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:10,954
My first time on any plane.

81
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,873
Should it...? Should it be...?
Should it be making that noise?

82
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:26,845
No one has actually told me
why I'm in Berlin or what I'm doing.

83
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:30,223
<i>Something about
Captain America going crazy.</i>

84
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,183
- This is you.
- Oh, we're neighbors?

85
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,436
We're not roommates. Suit up.

86
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:35,937
Okay, Peter, you got this.

87
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:39,190
- What the hell are you wearing?
- It's my suit.

88
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,151
- Where's the case?
- What case?

89
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,902
What? I thought that was a closet.

90
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,320
- This is still my room?
- Go.

91
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,281
- My room is way bigger than...
- There.

92
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,199
I found the case. I found the case.

93
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,952
"A minor upgrade"?

94
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,039
Oh, my God.

95
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,415
- Put it on.
- What the...?

96
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,500
This is the coolest thing
I've ever seen...

97
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,003
- Let's go.
- But, yeah. Well, I don't understand.

98
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,547
Is it for me? Happy. Happy, wait.

99
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,592
This is insane. Insane.

100
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,886
Look at this thing.
Look. Look at the eyes.

101
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,347
- This is the greatest day of my life.
- Let's go.

102
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:14,642
Okay, there's Captain America, Iron Man,
Black Widow. Who's that new guy?

103
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,979
- Underoos!
- Oh, that's me. I gotta go. I gotta go.

104
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:20,940
Hey, everyone.

105
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,860
The craziest thing just happened.

106
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:27,697
I just had a fight with Captain America.
I stole his shield. I threw it at him...

107
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:31,034
What the hell? He's big now.
I gotta go. Hang on.

108
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,539
It was the most amazing thing!
Mr. Stark was like, "Hey, Underoos!"

109
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:40,043
I flipped in and stole Cap's shield.
I was like, "What's up, everybody?"

110
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,836
And then... Hey, just a second!

111
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,713
Coming!

112
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,299
Hey.

113
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,259
We have thin walls here.

114
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,222
What are you doing, a little video diary?

115
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,182
- Yeah.
- It's all right.

116
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,035
- I'd do the same thing.
- I told him not to.

117
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:58,228
- He was filming. I'm gonna wipe the chip.
- Okay.

118
00:07:58,395 --> 00:07:59,437
Hey. You know what?

119
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:02,941
We should make an alibi video
for your aunt anyway. You ready?

120
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:05,527
- An alibi? Sure. Okay.
- We rolling? Get in the frame.

121
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:09,406
Hey, May. How you doing? What are
you wearing? Something skimpy, I hope.

122
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,118
Peter, that's inappropriate.
Let's start over. You can edit it.

123
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,203
Three, two, one. Hey, May.

124
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:20,875
My gosh, I wanted to tell you what
an incredible job your nephew did...

125
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:24,921
...this weekend
at the Stark internship retreat.

126
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,715
Everyone was impressed.

127
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,009
Come on! It's a freaking merge. I'm sorry.

128
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,861
This is because you're not
on Queens Boulevard.

129
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,888
See, Happy is hoping to get
bumped up to asset management.

130
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,683
He was forehead of security,
before that he was a driver.

131
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,810
That was a private conversation.

132
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,457
I don't like joking about this.
It was hard to talk about that.

133
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,983
- No, seriously, was he snoring a bunch?
- Here we are. End of the line.

134
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,320
- Can you give us a moment?
- Want me to leave?

135
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,947
Grab Peter's case out of the trunk.

136
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,159
I can keep the suit?

137
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,411
Yes, we were just talking about it.

138
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:00,582
Do me a favor, though.
Happy's kind of your point guy on this.

139
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,917
Don't stress him out.
Don't do anything stupid.

140
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,003
I've seen his cardiogram.

141
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,755
- All right?
- Yes.

142
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:10,300
Don't do anything I would do,
and don't do anything I wouldn't do.

143
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:13,428
There's a little gray area in there.
That's where you operate.

144
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,722
- Wait, does that mean I'm an Avenger?
- No.

145
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:17,974
- This it?
- Seventh floor.

146
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,560
- I can take that. You don't have to.
- You'll take it?

147
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,104
- Yeah, I can take that.
- Thank you.

148
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:27,067
So when's our next...?
When's our next "retreat," you know?

149
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,861
- What, next mission?
- Yeah, the mission. The missions.

150
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,863
- We'll call you.
- Do you have my numbers?

151
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,239
No, I mean, we'll call you.

152
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,575
Like, someone will call you. All right?

153
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,994
- From your team.
- Okay. All right.

154
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:41,998
It's not a hug. I'm just grabbing
the door for you. We're not there yet.

155
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,710
Bye.

156
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,634
They're gonna call me.

157
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,727
What's up, Penis Parker?

158
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,441
<i>Rise and shine,
Midtown Science and Technology.</i>

159
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,568
<i>Don't forget
about your homecoming tickets.</i>

160
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:53,361
<i>Do you have a date for homecoming?</i>

161
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,655
<i>Thanks, Jason,
but I already have a date.</i>

162
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,782
<i>- Okay.
- Yeah.</i>

163
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:07,542
Damn it. You, in my office right now.

164
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,480
Join me, and together...

165
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,940
...we'll build my new LEGO Death Star.

166
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,860
- What?
- So lame.

167
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,612
That's awesome. How many pieces?

168
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,614
Three thousand eight hundred and three.

169
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:41,034
- That's insane.
- I know. You want to build it tonight?

170
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,119
No, I can't tonight. I've got the Stark...

171
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:44,954
- Stark internship.
- Yeah, exactly.

172
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,373
Always got that internship.

173
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,459
Yeah, well, hopefully,
soon it'll lead to a real job with them.

174
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,127
- That would be so sweet.
- Right?

175
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,672
He'd be all, "Good job
on those spreadsheets, Peter.

176
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,507
Here's a gold coin."

177
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,177
- I don't know how jobs work.
- That's exactly how they work.

178
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:02,055
I'll knock out the bones of the Death Star.

179
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:06,142
I'll come by afterwards. For the most part,
the difficult thing is the base of it.

180
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:09,646
The top half we can knock out
in two hours, tops.

181
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:12,816
That'd be great.

182
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,317
I'm gonna be late.

183
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,820
Okay, so how do we calculate
linear acceleration...

184
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:20,073
...between points A and B?

185
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,282
Flash.

186
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,494
It's the product of sine of the angle
and gravity divided by mass.

187
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,956
Nope. Peter. You still with us?

188
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,376
Yeah, yeah.

189
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,880
Mass cancels out,
so it's just gravity times sine.

190
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:39,926
Right. See, Flash, being the fastest
isn't always the best if you are wrong.

191
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,720
You're dead.

192
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,394
Today we're talking
about Danish physicist Niels Bohr...

193
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,230
...but trust me,
there's nothing Bohr-ing...

194
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,692
...about his discoveries
regarding quantum theory.

195
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,704
Did Liz get a new top?

196
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:11,624
No. We've seen that before,
but never with that skirt.

197
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,627
- Liz, hey. That looks so good.
- Hi!

198
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,422
We should probably stop staring
before it gets creepy.

199
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:18,840
Too late.

200
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:20,675
You guys are losers.

201
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,053
Well, then why do you sit with us?

202
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,763
Because I don't have any friends.

203
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,767
Next question.

204
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,436
What is the heaviest
naturally-occurring element?

205
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,688
Hydrogen's the lightest.

206
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,315
That's not the question. Okay.

207
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:36,691
- Yeah.
- Uranium.

208
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:38,943
Correct. Thank you, Abraham.

209
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,154
- Yes.
- Please open your books to page 10.

210
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,531
Peter, it's nationals.

211
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:45,909
Is there no way
you could take one weekend off?

212
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:50,038
I can't go to Washington. If Mr. Stark
needs me, I have to make sure I'm here.

213
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:52,582
You've never been
in the same room as Tony Stark.

214
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,000
Wait. What's happening?

215
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,127
- Peter's not going to Washington.
- No.

216
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:58,463
- No, no, no.
- Why not?

217
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,340
Really? Right before nationals?

218
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:03,176
He already quit marching band
and robotics lab.

219
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,596
I'm not obsessed with him.
Just very observant.

220
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,015
Flash, you're in for Peter.

221
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,309
I don't know.
I gotta check my calendar first.

222
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,687
I got a hot date
with Black Widow coming up.

223
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,647
That is false.

224
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:19,192
What'd I tell you about using the bell
for comedic purposes?

225
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,585
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, man.

226
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,880
What's up, Mr. Delmar?

227
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,590
Hey, Mr. Parker.

228
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:43,967
Number five, right?

229
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:47,637
Yeah, and with pickles, and can you
smush it down real flat? Thanks.

230
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,264
You got it, boss.

231
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:50,974
How's your aunt?

232
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,642
Yeah, she's all right.

233
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:56,354
She's a very hot Italian woman.

234
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,565
How's your daughter?

235
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,194
- Ten dollars.
- It's 5 dollars.

236
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:07,073
- For that comment, 10 dollars.
- Hey, come on. I'm joking. I'm joking.

237
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,576
Here's 5 dollars.

238
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:12,245
What's up, Murph?

239
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,372
How you doing, buddy?

240
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,625
So how's school?

241
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,753
It's boring. Got better things to do.

242
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,173
Stay in school, kid.
Otherwise, you're gonna end up like me.

243
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:26,885
- This is great.
- Best sandwiches in Queens.

244
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:37,580
Finally.

245
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:45,088
- What's the matter with you?
- Could you hold this?

246
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:46,589
Thanks.

247
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:50,927
Hey, is this anybody's bike? No?

248
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:53,513
- Hey, buddy, is this your bike?
- I have no change.

249
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,974
Does anyone have a pen?
Do you have a pen?

250
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,438
Everybody good?

251
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:08,778
Hey!

252
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,740
You're that spider guy
on YouTube, right?

253
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:12,949
Call me Spider-Man.

254
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,618
Okay, Spider-Man. Do a flip.

255
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:19,330
- Yeah!
- Not bad.

256
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:33,178
Hey, buddy.

257
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:37,390
- Shouldn't steal cars, it's bad.
- It's my car, dumbass!

258
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,267
Hey! Shut that off!

259
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:41,478
- Can you tell him it's my car?
- I was...

260
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:44,189
- I work at nights. Come on.
- That's not your car!

261
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:46,483
- That's his car.
- How was I supposed to know?

262
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:49,170
- He was putting that in the window!
- Every day with these alarms!

263
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:52,030
- Turn it off!
- Don't make me come down there, punk.

264
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:54,866
Hey, Gary. How you doing?

265
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:57,369
Marjorie, how are you?
How's your mother?

266
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,752
I'm good, I'm good.

267
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:08,380
<i>You have reached
the voicemail box of:</i>

268
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:10,006
<i>Happy Hogan.</i>

269
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:12,384
Hey, Happy. Here's my report for tonight.

270
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,052
I stopped a grand theft bicycle.

271
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:16,763
Couldn't find the owner,
so I just left a note.

272
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:20,225
I helped this lost, old Dominican lady.

273
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:23,269
She was really nice
and bought me a churro.

274
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:26,606
I just feel like I could be doing more.

275
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,984
You know? Just curious
when the next real mission's gonna be.

276
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,445
So, yeah, just call me back.

277
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:35,365
It's Peter. Parker.

278
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:42,747
Why would I tell him about the churro?

279
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:48,003
Hey, hey.

280
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,842
Okay.

281
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:58,096
- Can't wait to see this thing.
- Finally, something good.

282
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,852
Yo, this high-tech stuff makes it too easy.

283
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:06,855
- Told you it was worth it.
- Okay, go, go, go.

284
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:12,736
Oh, nice.

285
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:15,739
We can hit, like, five more places tonight.

286
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,461
What's up, guys?
You forget your PIN number?

287
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:30,920
You're the Avengers.

288
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,006
What are you guys doing here?

289
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:37,761
Thor. Hulk.
Good to finally meet you guys.

290
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,431
I thought you'd be more handsome
in person. Iron Man.

291
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:44,517
Hey, what are you doing robbing a bank?
You're a billionaire.

292
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:48,355
Hey...

293
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,523
Oh, this feels so weird.

294
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:54,611
What is that thing?

295
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:59,032
I'm starting to think
you're not the Avengers.

296
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:04,746
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

297
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:09,501
Spider-Man is fighting the Avengers
in a bank on 21st Street.

298
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:11,503
Let's wrap this up. It's a school night.

299
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,051
So how do jerks like you
get tech like this?

300
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,013
No. Wait, wait, wait!

301
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:28,436
Mr. Delmar.

302
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:32,857
Hey, Mr. Delmar, you in here?
Is anybody in here? Hello?

303
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,827
Oh, come on.

304
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,247
I gotta...

305
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,874
- Here, here.
- Good, yeah.

306
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:53,336
Okay. Good. Yes.

307
00:20:53,503 --> 00:20:54,921
Yes... No. No, put that down.

308
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:58,216
That's worth more
than you or me. Yeah?

309
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:01,469
The craziest thing just happened.
These guys were robbing an ATM...

310
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:03,990
- ...with high-tech weapons...
- Take a breath. I don't have time...

311
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:05,890
- ...for ATM robberies...
<i>- Yeah, but...</i>

312
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:09,310
...or the notes you leave.
I have moving day to worry about.

313
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:11,187
<i>Everything's gotta be out next week.</i>

314
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:14,983
- Wait. You're moving? Who's moving?
- Yeah, don't you watch the news?

315
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:18,445
Tony sold Avengers Tower.
We're relocating to a new facility upstate...

316
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:21,823
- ...where hopefully cell service is worse.
- But what about me?

317
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:23,742
What about you?

318
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:26,953
Well, what if Mr. Stark needs me
or something big goes down?

319
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:30,582
- <i>Can I please talk to Mr. Stark?
</i>-Stay away from anything dangerous.

320
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:33,501
I'm responsible for making sure
you're responsible, okay?

321
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:37,881
I am responsible. I... Oh, crap.

322
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:40,467
- <i>My backpack's gone.
</i>-That doesn't sound responsible.

323
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:43,636
- <i>I'll call you back.
</i>-Feel free not to.

324
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:45,782
What was that?

325
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:48,326
It's nothing. Nothing.

326
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:50,203
You're the Spider-Man.

327
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:53,206
- From YouTube.
- I'm not. I'm not.

328
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:55,810
- You were on the ceiling.
- No. What are you doing in my room?

329
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,834
May let me in.
We were gonna finish the Death Star.

330
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,130
You can't just bust into my room!

331
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:03,008
That turkey meatloaf recipe is a disaster.

332
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:05,802
Let's go to dinner.
Thai? Ned, you want Thai?

333
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:07,220
- Yes.
- No. He's got a thing.

334
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:09,973
A thing to do after.

335
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:12,017
Okay.

336
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:14,853
Maybe put on some clothes.

337
00:23:16,354 --> 00:23:18,356
- Oh, she doesn't know?
- Nobody knows.

338
00:23:18,523 --> 00:23:20,775
Mr. Stark knows
because he made my suit. That's it.

339
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:24,154
Tony Stark made you that?
Are you an Avenger?

340
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:26,906
Yeah, basically.

341
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:31,369
You can't tell anybody about this.
You gotta keep it a secret.

342
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:33,371
- Secret? Why?
- You know what she's like.

343
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:36,618
If she finds out people try and kill me
every night, she won't let me do this.

344
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:37,917
Come on, Ned, please.

345
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:39,794
Okay, okay, okay.

346
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:42,672
I'll level with you.
I can't keep this a secret.

347
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:44,734
It's the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me.

348
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:47,427
Ned, May cannot know.
I cannot do that to her right now.

349
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:51,348
You know? I mean, everything
that's happened with her, I... Please.

350
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:56,394
- Okay.
- Just swear it, okay?

351
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:57,896
I swear.

352
00:23:58,063 --> 00:24:00,106
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

353
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:02,192
I can't believe this is happening now.

354
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:03,610
- Can I try the suit on?
- No.

355
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:05,755
How's it work? Magnets?
How do you shoot the strings?

356
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:07,989
- I'm gonna tell you at school tomorrow.
- Great.

357
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:10,116
Okay, well, wait, then.

358
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:13,787
How do you do this
and the Stark internship?

359
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:17,040
This is the Stark internship.

360
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,251
Just get out of here.

361
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:24,464
<i>What's the matter?</i>

362
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:26,549
Thought you loved larb.

363
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:28,885
It's too larby?

364
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:31,763
Not larby enough.

365
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:36,518
How many times do I have to say "larb"
before you talk to me?

366
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:38,853
You know I larb you.

367
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,065
I'm just stressed.
The internship, and I'm tired.

368
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:43,274
A lot of work.

369
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:45,694
The Stark internship.

370
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:49,531
I have to tell you,
not a fan of that Tony Stark.

371
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:53,910
You're distracted all the time.
He's got you in your head.

372
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:57,163
<i>- Delmar's Sandwiches was destroyed...
</i>-What does he have you doing?

373
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,058
<i>- ...in an explosion...
</i>-You need to use your instincts.

374
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:02,210
<i>...after an ATM robbery was thwarted
by Queens' own crime stopper...</i>

375
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:03,461
What?

376
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:05,171
<i>...the Spider-Man.</i>

377
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:07,674
<i>As the Spider-Man attempted
to foil their heist...</i>

378
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:11,511
<i>...a powerful blast was set off, slicing
through the bodega across the street.</i>

379
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:13,722
<i>Miraculously, no one was harmed.</i>

380
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:17,976
If you spot something like that happening,
you turn and you run the other way.

381
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:19,894
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.

382
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:21,354
Six blocks away from us.

383
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:23,523
I need a new backpack.

384
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:27,152
- What?
- I need a new backpack.

385
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,820
That's five.

386
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,365
- Sticky rice pudding.
- We didn't order that.

387
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:34,367
It's on the house.

388
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:36,411
Thanks.

389
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:40,457
That's nice of him.

390
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:43,209
I think he larbs you.

391
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:46,338
<i>You got bit by a spider?</i>

392
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:47,964
Can it bite me?

393
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:49,966
Well, it probably would've hurt, right?

394
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:52,427
Whatever. Even if it did hurt,
I'd let it bite me.

395
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:54,179
Maybe. How much did it hurt?

396
00:25:54,346 --> 00:25:56,556
The spider's dead, Ned.

397
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:06,900
You were here?

398
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:09,027
Yeah.

399
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:11,821
You could've died.

400
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:16,201
Do you lay eggs?

401
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:18,078
What? No.

402
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:23,291
- Can you spit venom?
- No.

403
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:25,752
Can you summon an army of spiders?

404
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,003
No, Ned.

405
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:30,090
The Sokovia Accords were put
into place....

406
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:32,550
How far can you shoot your webs?

407
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:33,927
It's unknown. Shut up.

408
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:35,345
--to begin regulating....

409
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:37,847
If I was you,
I would stand on a building...

410
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:41,393
- ...and just shoot it as far as I could...
- Shut up, Ned.

411
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:45,438
<i>Hi. I'm Captain America. Whether you're
in the classroom or on the battlefield...</i>

412
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:47,273
- Do you know him too?
- Yeah, we met.

413
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,043
<i>...fitness can be the difference
between success or failure.</i>

414
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:51,152
- I stole his shield.
- What?

415
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:53,363
<i>Today, my good friend,
your gym teacher...</i>

416
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:56,157
<i>...will conduct
the Captain America Fitness Challenge.</i>

417
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:57,409
Thank you, Captain.

418
00:26:57,575 --> 00:27:00,620
Pretty sure he's a war criminal,
but I have to show these videos.

419
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:02,997
It's required by the state. Let's do it.

420
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:04,666
Do Avengers have to pay taxes?

421
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:06,459
What does Hulk smell like?

422
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:08,628
- I bet he smells nice.
- You have to shut up.

423
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:11,506
Is Captain America cool,
or is he like a mean, old grandpa?

424
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:13,591
Ned, just... okay?

425
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:17,262
- Hey, can I be your guy in the chair?
- What?

426
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:19,973
Yeah. You know how there's a guy
with a headset...

427
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,975
...telling the other guy where to go?

428
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:24,978
If you're in a burning building,
I could tell you where to go.

429
00:27:25,145 --> 00:27:27,731
There'd be screens around me,
and I could swivel around.

430
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:30,984
- I could be your guy in the chair.
- I don't need a guy in the chair.

431
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:32,819
Looking good, Parker.

432
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:38,491
Now, see, for me, it would be F Thor...

433
00:27:38,658 --> 00:27:40,535
...marry Iron Man and kill Hulk.

434
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:42,537
Well, what about the Spider-Man?

435
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:43,913
It's just Spider-Man.

436
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,292
Did you see the bank security cam
on YouTube? He fought off four guys.

437
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:49,294
Oh, my God,
she's crushing on Spider-Man.

438
00:27:49,461 --> 00:27:50,545
No way.

439
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:52,756
- Kind of.
- Oh, gross.

440
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:55,985
- He's probably 30.
- You don't know what he looks like.

441
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:57,969
Like, what if he's seriously burned?

442
00:27:58,136 --> 00:28:00,847
I wouldn't care. I'd love him
for the person he is inside.

443
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:02,891
Peter knows Spider-Man.

444
00:28:05,685 --> 00:28:07,854
No, I don't. No. I... I mean...

445
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:10,357
They're friends.

446
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:13,485
Yeah, like Coach Wilson
and Captain America are friends.

447
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:16,363
I've met him, yeah. A couple times.

448
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:17,906
But it's...

449
00:28:18,782 --> 00:28:20,784
...through the Stark internship.

450
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,579
Yeah, well, I'm not really supposed
to talk about it.

451
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:26,623
Well, that's awesome.
Hey, you know what?

452
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:29,459
Maybe you should invite him
to Liz's party. Right?

453
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:32,921
Yeah, I'm having people over tonight.
You're more than welcome to come.

454
00:28:33,088 --> 00:28:35,507
- Having a party?
- Yeah, it's gonna be dope.

455
00:28:35,674 --> 00:28:38,468
You should totally invite
your personal friend Spider-Man.

456
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:40,178
It's okay.

457
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:43,056
I know Peter's way too busy
for parties anyway, so....

458
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:45,058
Come on. He'll be there. Right, Parker?

459
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:52,899
What are you doing?

460
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:54,567
Helping you out.

461
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:56,319
Did you not hear her?

462
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:58,947
Liz has a crush on you.

463
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:03,451
Dude, you're an Avenger.

464
00:29:03,618 --> 00:29:07,497
If any one of us has a chance
with a senior girl, it's you.

465
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:13,294
House party in the suburbs.

466
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:16,840
Oh, I remember these. Kind of jealous.

467
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:19,217
It'll be a night to remember.

468
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:22,512
Ned, some hats wear men.
You wear that hat.

469
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,639
Yeah, it gives me confidence.

470
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:26,016
This is a mistake.

471
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:27,434
Hey, let's just go home.

472
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,060
Oh, Peter.

473
00:29:29,227 --> 00:29:31,980
I know. I know it's really hard...

474
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:35,400
...trying to fit in with all the changes
your body's going through.

475
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:36,609
It's flowering now.

476
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:40,864
He's so stressed out lately.

477
00:29:41,031 --> 00:29:42,615
What helps with stress is a party.

478
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:45,660
- We should go to the party.
- Yeah, let's do it. I'm gonna go.

479
00:29:47,245 --> 00:29:48,705
Peter.

480
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:51,708
- Have fun, okay? Okay.
- I will.

481
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:53,752
Bye, May.

482
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:57,756
Dude, you have the suit, right?

483
00:29:57,922 --> 00:30:00,175
- Yeah.
- This is gonna change our lives.

484
00:30:05,096 --> 00:30:07,015
- Annie, over here!
- Hey.

485
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:08,350
Hey.

486
00:30:11,978 --> 00:30:13,355
<i>DJ Flash.</i>

487
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:16,483
Okay. We're gonna have
Spider-Man swing in...

488
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:20,612
...say you guys are tight, and I get
a fist bump or one of those half bro-hugs.

489
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:22,906
Can't believe you're at this lame party.

490
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:24,282
But you're here too.

491
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,993
Am I?

492
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:30,789
Oh, my gosh.

493
00:30:30,955 --> 00:30:32,749
Hey, guys. Cool hat, Ned.

494
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:34,668
- Hi, Liz.
- Hi, Liz.

495
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:36,711
I'm so happy you guys came.

496
00:30:36,878 --> 00:30:39,381
There's pizza and drinks. Help yourself.

497
00:30:40,382 --> 00:30:42,842
- What a great party.
- Thanks.

498
00:30:45,512 --> 00:30:46,763
Oh, I...

499
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:49,599
My parents will kill me
if anything's broken. I gotta...

500
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:51,226
- Yeah.
- Have fun.

501
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:53,353
- Bye.
- Bye.

502
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,522
Dude, what are you doing?

503
00:30:55,689 --> 00:30:57,774
She's here. Spider it up.

504
00:30:57,941 --> 00:31:00,568
No, no, no. I can't... I cannot do this.

505
00:31:00,735 --> 00:31:02,987
Spider-Man is not a party trick, okay?

506
00:31:03,154 --> 00:31:05,824
Look, I'm just gonna be myself.

507
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:08,284
Peter, no one wants that.

508
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,245
Dude.

509
00:31:10,745 --> 00:31:13,540
Penis Parker, what's up?

510
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,542
So where's your pal Spider-Man?

511
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:18,253
Let me guess: In Canada
with your imaginary girlfriend?

512
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:23,883
That's not Spider-Man.
That's just Ned in a red shirt.

513
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:33,601
"Hey, what's up? I'm Spider-Man.

514
00:31:33,768 --> 00:31:36,813
Just thought I'd swing by
and say hello to my buddy Peter.

515
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,149
Oh, what's up, Ned?
Hey, where's Peter, anyways?

516
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:41,151
He must be around...."

517
00:31:45,697 --> 00:31:48,575
God, this is stupid. What am I doing?

518
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:58,793
What the hell?

519
00:32:20,315 --> 00:32:21,358
This sucks.

520
00:32:26,821 --> 00:32:30,909
Now, this is crafted from a reclaimed
sub-Ultron arm straight from Sokovia.

521
00:32:31,076 --> 00:32:32,369
Here. You try.

522
00:32:34,162 --> 00:32:37,332
I wanted something low-key.
Why are you trying to upsell me, man?

523
00:32:37,499 --> 00:32:39,584
Okay, okay.
I got what you need, all right?

524
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:42,545
I got tons of great stuff here. One sec.

525
00:32:43,296 --> 00:32:47,759
Okay, I got black hole grenades,
Chitauri railguns....

526
00:32:47,926 --> 00:32:50,011
You letting off shots
in public now? Hurry up.

527
00:32:50,178 --> 00:32:53,807
Look, times are changing. We're the only
ones selling these high-tech weapons.

528
00:32:54,766 --> 00:32:57,227
This must be where
the ATM robbers got their stuff.

529
00:32:57,394 --> 00:33:01,773
I need something to stick up somebody.
I'm not trying to shoot them back in time.

530
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,150
I got antigrav climbers.

531
00:33:04,317 --> 00:33:05,402
Yo, climbers?

532
00:33:07,904 --> 00:33:09,197
Okay, what the hell is that?

533
00:33:11,658 --> 00:33:13,368
- Did you set us up?
- Hey, hey, man.

534
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:19,708
Hey! Hey, come on. You gonna shoot
at somebody, shoot at me.

535
00:33:19,874 --> 00:33:21,001
All right.

536
00:33:33,513 --> 00:33:35,640
What was that?

537
00:33:46,735 --> 00:33:49,946
- We gotta call him.
- No, no, no.

538
00:33:55,744 --> 00:33:56,911
Did you just do it again?

539
00:33:57,078 --> 00:33:59,247
- Shut up.
- I'm calling him.

540
00:34:08,298 --> 00:34:10,342
Toomes's phone.

541
00:34:11,343 --> 00:34:12,886
Boss.

542
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:14,179
Oh, my butt!

543
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,993
Great. Guess I'm gonna have
to take a shortcut.

544
00:34:39,788 --> 00:34:41,831
Hey, guys. Good game. Have fun.

545
00:34:41,998 --> 00:34:43,750
Hey, hey, buddy.

546
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:46,419
Sorry, no time to play. Here, go fetch.

547
00:34:48,296 --> 00:34:50,757
Now, this is more like it.

548
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:04,562
Smells really good.

549
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:10,193
Great movie!

550
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:17,283
Oh, hey, guys.

551
00:35:18,326 --> 00:35:20,370
No! No!

552
00:35:20,537 --> 00:35:23,248
<i>Hey, it's Peter. Leave a message.</i>

553
00:35:23,415 --> 00:35:24,916
Peter, where are you?

554
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:26,960
The hat's not working. This is not cool.

555
00:35:28,003 --> 00:35:30,005
Almost got you.

556
00:35:42,225 --> 00:35:44,477
Thought you got away from me,
didn't you?

557
00:35:45,228 --> 00:35:46,855
I got you right where I want you.

558
00:35:47,981 --> 00:35:49,858
Surprise!

559
00:35:53,153 --> 00:35:54,946
What the hell?

560
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:43,953
Oh, hey.

561
00:36:47,415 --> 00:36:50,460
And then he just, like,
swooped down like a monster...

562
00:36:50,627 --> 00:36:54,172
...and picked me up, and took me up
like a thousand feet and just dropped me.

563
00:36:54,673 --> 00:36:57,175
How'd you find me?
Did you put a tracker in my suit?

564
00:36:57,342 --> 00:36:59,177
I put everything in your suit.

565
00:36:59,344 --> 00:37:00,679
Including this heater.

566
00:37:04,015 --> 00:37:06,351
That's better. Thanks.

567
00:37:06,518 --> 00:37:07,686
What were you thinking?

568
00:37:07,852 --> 00:37:11,147
The guy with wings is the source
of the weapons. I gotta take him down.

569
00:37:11,314 --> 00:37:12,982
Take him down now, huh?

570
00:37:13,149 --> 00:37:15,944
Crockett, there are people
who handle this sort of thing.

571
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:18,947
- The Avengers?
- No. This is a little below their pay grade.

572
00:37:19,114 --> 00:37:21,116
Mr. Stark, you didn't have
to come out here.

573
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:22,701
I had that. I was fine.

574
00:37:23,326 --> 00:37:26,287
<i>Oh, I'm not here.</i>

575
00:37:27,163 --> 00:37:28,957
Thank God this place has Wi-Fi...

576
00:37:29,124 --> 00:37:30,917
...or you would be toast right now.

577
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:34,087
Thank Ganesh while you're at it. Cheers.

578
00:37:34,254 --> 00:37:36,423
<i>Look, forget the flying vulture guy,
please.</i>

579
00:37:36,589 --> 00:37:37,632
- Why?
<i>- Why?</i>

580
00:37:37,799 --> 00:37:39,843
Because I said so!

581
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:43,013
Sorry, I'm talking to a teenager.

582
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:44,639
<i>Stay close to the ground.</i>

583
00:37:44,806 --> 00:37:48,852
Build up your game helping little people,
like that lady that bought you the churro.

584
00:37:49,477 --> 00:37:52,397
Can't you just be a friendly...

585
00:37:53,023 --> 00:37:54,399
...neighborhood Spider-Man?

586
00:37:54,566 --> 00:37:56,276
But I'm ready for more than that now.

587
00:37:56,776 --> 00:37:57,819
<i>No, you're not.</i>

588
00:37:57,986 --> 00:38:00,306
That's not what you thought
when I took on Captain America.

589
00:38:00,447 --> 00:38:03,074
<i>Trust me, kid. If Cap wanted
to lay you out, he would've.</i>

590
00:38:03,491 --> 00:38:07,996
<i>Listen to me. If you come across
these weapons again, call Happy.</i>

591
00:38:08,163 --> 00:38:09,622
Are you driving?

592
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:12,792
You know, it's never too early
to start thinking about college.

593
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:14,711
I got some pull at MIT. End call.

594
00:38:16,296 --> 00:38:17,589
No, I don't need to go to...

595
00:38:17,756 --> 00:38:19,799
<i>Mr. Stark is no longer connected.</i>

596
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:24,346
That's awesome.

597
00:38:26,973 --> 00:38:30,435
"Stay close to the ground"?
What is he talking about?

598
00:38:49,537 --> 00:38:51,164
Hey, what's up? I'm on my way back.

599
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:54,542
Actually, I was calling to say
maybe you shouldn't come. Listen.

600
00:38:54,709 --> 00:38:56,878
When I say "penis," you say "Parker."

601
00:38:57,045 --> 00:38:58,088
- Penis!
- Parker!

602
00:38:58,254 --> 00:38:59,464
- Penis!
- Parker!

603
00:38:59,964 --> 00:39:02,217
<i>Sorry, Peter. I guess we're still losers.</i>

604
00:39:02,384 --> 00:39:05,303
<i>- I'll see you tomorrow.
</i>-I'll see you tomorrow in school.

605
00:39:45,343 --> 00:39:47,053
Idiots.

606
00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:49,014
Idiots.

607
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,724
Idiots!

608
00:39:51,558 --> 00:39:52,600
Boss?

609
00:39:52,934 --> 00:39:56,229
Your wife keeps texting you.
Something about a brake light.

610
00:39:56,646 --> 00:39:58,815
What'd I tell you about
looking at my phone?

611
00:39:58,982 --> 00:40:00,233
Sorry. You left it out.

612
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,235
You know
I'm a curious person by nature.

613
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:07,282
I finished designing
that high-altitude vacuum seal.

614
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:11,536
In case you want to,
you know, go for the big one?

615
00:40:11,703 --> 00:40:13,747
You're still on that? I told you, no.

616
00:40:13,913 --> 00:40:15,457
The answer's no. Forget it.

617
00:40:27,177 --> 00:40:29,596
I mean, that was badass.

618
00:40:32,223 --> 00:40:36,102
How many times have I told you
not to fire them out in the open?

619
00:40:36,269 --> 00:40:38,813
- You said, move the merchandise.
- Under the radar.

620
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,190
Under the radar!

621
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:42,108
That's how we survive.

622
00:40:42,275 --> 00:40:45,612
If you bring Damage Control
or the Avengers down here, we're through.

623
00:40:46,237 --> 00:40:49,199
You're out there wearing that goofy thing,
lighting up cars...

624
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:50,867
...calling yourself the Shocker.

625
00:40:51,034 --> 00:40:54,162
"I'm the Shocker. I shock people."
What is this, pro wrestling?

626
00:40:54,329 --> 00:40:56,122
Whatever, old man. Come on.

627
00:40:57,582 --> 00:40:59,000
Look.

628
00:40:59,167 --> 00:41:00,585
Look.

629
00:41:00,752 --> 00:41:03,421
I know you don't give a crap
about anything.

630
00:41:03,588 --> 00:41:05,215
But I do.

631
00:41:05,382 --> 00:41:08,510
I built this whole place
because I got people I have to look after.

632
00:41:08,677 --> 00:41:11,888
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

633
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,558
You know what?

634
00:41:15,725 --> 00:41:18,395
I can't afford your bullshit.

635
00:41:18,561 --> 00:41:20,021
- Get out of here.
- What?

636
00:41:20,188 --> 00:41:23,483
- You're done. You're off the crew.
- Yeah, all right.

637
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:25,402
All right.

638
00:41:25,568 --> 00:41:27,987
Wonder if you can afford me
out there, though, right?

639
00:41:28,154 --> 00:41:29,989
With everything I know.

640
00:41:30,949 --> 00:41:33,785
- Excuse me?
- I'm just saying...

641
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:37,789
...maybe your wife would like to know
where you really get your money from.

642
00:41:38,581 --> 00:41:40,208
- You know what?
- What?

643
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:41,751
You're right.

644
00:41:41,918 --> 00:41:43,378
- That work?
- I don't know.

645
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:46,214
I can't afford that.

646
00:41:47,424 --> 00:41:48,925
Wait.

647
00:41:55,557 --> 00:41:57,058
Damn.

648
00:41:59,644 --> 00:42:02,022
- I thought this was the antigravity gun.
- What?

649
00:42:02,188 --> 00:42:03,273
No, that's that one.

650
00:42:16,745 --> 00:42:17,787
Here.

651
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,959
Now you're the Shocker. Go out there
and find that weapon he lost.

652
00:42:23,126 --> 00:42:24,169
All right.

653
00:42:33,595 --> 00:42:35,388
Hey, thanks for bailing on me.

654
00:42:35,555 --> 00:42:37,515
Yeah, well, something came up.

655
00:42:37,682 --> 00:42:38,892
What is that?

656
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:41,853
I don't know.
Some guy tried to vaporize me with it.

657
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,480
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

658
00:42:43,646 --> 00:42:45,106
Awesome.

659
00:42:45,273 --> 00:42:48,360
I mean, not awesome.
Totally uncool of that guy.

660
00:42:48,526 --> 00:42:50,320
So scary.

661
00:42:51,654 --> 00:42:53,323
Well, look, I think it's...

662
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:54,949
...a power source.

663
00:42:55,116 --> 00:42:57,702
Yeah, but it's connected
to all these microprocessors.

664
00:42:57,869 --> 00:43:01,081
That's an inductive charging plate. That's
what I use to charge my toothbrush.

665
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:04,292
Whoever's making these weapons
is combining alien tech with ours.

666
00:43:04,459 --> 00:43:08,338
That is literally the coolest sentence
anyone has ever said.

667
00:43:08,505 --> 00:43:11,549
I just want to thank you
for letting me be part of your journey...

668
00:43:11,716 --> 00:43:14,094
...into this amazing...

669
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,724
Keep your fingers clear of the blades.

670
00:43:21,851 --> 00:43:23,978
I gotta figure out what this is
and who makes it.

671
00:43:24,145 --> 00:43:26,356
We'll go to the lab after class
and run tests.

672
00:43:26,523 --> 00:43:27,816
Let's do it.

673
00:43:35,281 --> 00:43:37,575
First, we put the glowy thing
in the mass spectrometer.

674
00:43:37,742 --> 00:43:40,203
We gotta come up with a better name
than "glowy thingy."

675
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:41,454
You're right.

676
00:43:42,956 --> 00:43:44,082
Crap.

677
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:46,167
Come on, come on, come on.

678
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:52,382
High schools creep me out.

679
00:43:53,091 --> 00:43:55,051
They got this funny smell, you know?

680
00:43:55,218 --> 00:43:57,512
Hey, that's one of the guys
that tried to kill me.

681
00:43:57,679 --> 00:43:58,722
What?

682
00:43:58,888 --> 00:44:00,390
- Yeah.
- We gotta get out of here.

683
00:44:00,557 --> 00:44:02,434
No, no, no. I gotta follow them.

684
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,186
They can lead me to the guy
that dropped me in the lake.

685
00:44:05,353 --> 00:44:07,605
- Someone dropped you in a lake?
- Yeah, it was not good.

686
00:44:09,607 --> 00:44:11,026
- Peter...
- No. Stay there, Ned.

687
00:44:11,192 --> 00:44:12,777
Peter.

688
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,073
What are you doing?

689
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,491
Nothing.

690
00:44:18,658 --> 00:44:20,827
Yeah. You good?

691
00:44:20,994 --> 00:44:22,037
Chess.

692
00:44:24,998 --> 00:44:28,418
Man, can you imagine what the boss
would say if he knew where we were?

693
00:44:28,585 --> 00:44:30,670
It's saying there was
an energy pulse here.

694
00:44:30,837 --> 00:44:32,255
There's no sign of the weapon.

695
00:44:32,422 --> 00:44:35,383
- And even if it was here, now it's gone.
- So are we.

696
00:45:07,999 --> 00:45:10,919
This is so awesome.

697
00:45:11,086 --> 00:45:12,921
I know, right?

698
00:45:16,132 --> 00:45:17,926
They're in Brooklyn.

699
00:45:22,097 --> 00:45:24,057
Staten Island.

700
00:45:29,771 --> 00:45:31,690
Leaving Jersey.

701
00:45:39,197 --> 00:45:40,949
They stopped.

702
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:44,744
Maryland?

703
00:45:44,911 --> 00:45:47,163
- What's there?
- I don't know.

704
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:48,373
Evil lair?

705
00:45:48,915 --> 00:45:50,959
- They have a lair?
- A gang with alien guns...

706
00:45:51,126 --> 00:45:52,919
...run by a guy with wings? Yeah.

707
00:45:53,086 --> 00:45:54,504
Badass.

708
00:45:54,671 --> 00:45:57,549
But how are you gonna get there
if it's, like, 300 miles away?

709
00:45:59,801 --> 00:46:02,387
It's not too far from D.C.

710
00:46:03,471 --> 00:46:04,597
- Hey, it's Peter.
- Guys.

711
00:46:04,764 --> 00:46:05,807
- Peter?
- Hey, buddy.

712
00:46:05,974 --> 00:46:07,851
I was hoping I could rejoin the team.

713
00:46:08,018 --> 00:46:09,644
No, no way. You can't quit on us...

714
00:46:09,811 --> 00:46:12,439
...stroll up and be welcomed back
by everyone.

715
00:46:12,605 --> 00:46:15,483
Hey, welcome back!
Flash, you're back to first alternate.

716
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:16,985
- What?
- He's taking your place.

717
00:46:17,152 --> 00:46:18,528
Excuse me, can we go already?

718
00:46:18,695 --> 00:46:22,490
I was hoping to get in some protesting
in front of an embassy before dinner.

719
00:46:22,657 --> 00:46:25,118
Protesting is patriotic.
Let's get on the bus.

720
00:46:27,078 --> 00:46:30,373
<i>Focus up.
Our next topic is the moons of Saturn.</i>

721
00:46:30,832 --> 00:46:32,459
The second law of thermodynamics.

722
00:46:33,001 --> 00:46:34,919
- Frank Sinatra.
- Fort Sumter.

723
00:46:35,628 --> 00:46:37,922
- Flash is wrong.
- Okay, let's focus. Next one.

724
00:46:38,089 --> 00:46:39,424
Liz, don't overwork them.

725
00:46:39,924 --> 00:46:41,634
Strontium, barium, vibranium.

726
00:46:41,801 --> 00:46:43,678
Very good, Peter. Glad to have you back.

727
00:46:43,845 --> 00:46:45,305
Glad to be back.

728
00:46:46,139 --> 00:46:49,142
- What is the current standard unit of...?
- Can I take this real quick?

729
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:50,810
Yeah, fine.

730
00:46:50,977 --> 00:46:52,771
- Hello?
- Got a blip on my screen here.

731
00:46:52,937 --> 00:46:53,980
You left New York?

732
00:46:54,147 --> 00:46:55,774
- Okay, focus up, everyone.
- Tracker.

733
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:58,068
Yeah, it's just a school trip.
It's nothing.

734
00:46:58,234 --> 00:47:00,653
Happy, I gotta say,
tracking me without permission...

735
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:02,614
...is a complete violation of privacy.

736
00:47:03,406 --> 00:47:05,116
- That's different.
- What's different?

737
00:47:05,283 --> 00:47:07,744
Nothing. Look, it's just
the Academic Decathlon.

738
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:10,997
<i>- It's no big deal.
</i>-Hey, hey. I'll decide if it's no big deal.

739
00:47:13,166 --> 00:47:15,752
Sounds like no big deal,
but remember, I'm watching you.

740
00:47:27,055 --> 00:47:29,724
- Everyone stick together.
- Yeah.

741
00:47:30,225 --> 00:47:32,060
You kidding me? This place is huge.

742
00:47:32,227 --> 00:47:34,813
- I've seen bigger.
- There's a bird in here.

743
00:47:34,979 --> 00:47:38,233
- Hey, you brought your laptop, right?
- Why?

744
00:47:46,282 --> 00:47:47,659
Peter...

745
00:47:47,826 --> 00:47:50,829
...why are we removing
the tracker from your suit?

746
00:47:52,414 --> 00:47:55,458
I gotta follow these guys to their boss
before they move again...

747
00:47:55,625 --> 00:47:58,586
...and I don't really want Mr. Stark
to know about it.

748
00:47:58,753 --> 00:48:00,588
So you're lying to Iron Man now?

749
00:48:00,755 --> 00:48:02,382
No, I'm not lying.

750
00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:05,176
He just doesn't really get
what I can do yet.

751
00:48:09,764 --> 00:48:11,266
Gotcha.

752
00:48:11,433 --> 00:48:15,603
All right, Happy, enjoy tracking this lamp.

753
00:48:18,565 --> 00:48:21,609
There's a ton
of other subsystems in here...

754
00:48:21,776 --> 00:48:25,405
...but they're all disabled
by the Training Wheels Protocol.

755
00:48:25,572 --> 00:48:26,698
What?

756
00:48:26,865 --> 00:48:30,493
"Training Wheels Protocol"? Turn it off.

757
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:33,580
I don't think that's a good idea.
They're blocked for a reason.

758
00:48:33,997 --> 00:48:36,332
Come on, man,
I don't need training wheels.

759
00:48:36,499 --> 00:48:38,877
I'm sick of him treating me
like a kid all the time.

760
00:48:39,044 --> 00:48:41,338
- It's not cool.
- But you are a kid.

761
00:48:41,504 --> 00:48:43,590
A kid who can stop a bus
with his bare hands.

762
00:48:43,757 --> 00:48:47,510
Peter, I just don't think this is a great idea.
I mean, what if this is illegal?

763
00:48:47,677 --> 00:48:50,638
Look, please.
This is my chance to prove myself.

764
00:48:50,805 --> 00:48:52,557
I can handle it. Ned, come on.

765
00:48:52,724 --> 00:48:55,435
- I don't think this is a good idea.
- The guy in the chair.

766
00:48:55,894 --> 00:48:58,063
- Don't do that.
- Come on.

767
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,079
The glowy thing, it's evidence.
Keep it safe.

768
00:49:14,245 --> 00:49:15,830
- All right?
- Okay. Okay.

769
00:49:17,457 --> 00:49:19,000
- They're moving.
- Be careful.

770
00:49:23,046 --> 00:49:24,714
- Hey, Liz.
- Perfect timing.

771
00:49:25,173 --> 00:49:26,299
We're gonna go swimming.

772
00:49:26,466 --> 00:49:28,134
- Come on, come on, come on.
- What?

773
00:49:28,802 --> 00:49:30,553
- Hey, Peter.
- Hi.

774
00:49:32,222 --> 00:49:33,556
Hey.

775
00:49:34,182 --> 00:49:38,019
I was... I was gonna go study
in the business center.

776
00:49:38,186 --> 00:49:40,522
You don't need to.
You're the smartest guy I've ever met.

777
00:49:40,689 --> 00:49:41,981
And besides...

778
00:49:42,148 --> 00:49:45,944
...a rebellious group activity the day
before competition is good for morale.

779
00:49:47,404 --> 00:49:49,489
Well, I read that in a TED Talk, so...

780
00:49:49,656 --> 00:49:51,908
I... I heard it in a TED Talk.

781
00:49:52,075 --> 00:49:53,993
And I read a coaching book.

782
00:49:55,078 --> 00:49:57,163
You really...
This is really important to you.

783
00:49:57,330 --> 00:49:59,207
Yeah. It's our future.

784
00:49:59,374 --> 00:50:00,792
I'm not gonna screw it up.

785
00:50:01,835 --> 00:50:05,714
Besides, we raided the minibar
and these candy bars were, like, $11.

786
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:09,134
- So get your trunks on and come on.
- Come on.

787
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,428
- Come on.
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

788
00:50:11,594 --> 00:50:12,637
Let's go.

789
00:50:36,536 --> 00:50:38,788
<i>- Good evening, Peter.
</i>-Hello? Hello?

790
00:50:38,955 --> 00:50:41,875
<i>Congratulations on completing
the Training Wheels Protocol...</i>

791
00:50:42,042 --> 00:50:44,586
<i>...and gaining access
to your suit's full capabilities.</i>

792
00:50:44,753 --> 00:50:46,338
Thank you.

793
00:50:46,504 --> 00:50:48,340
<i>Where would you like
to take me tonight?</i>

794
00:50:48,506 --> 00:50:51,217
I put a tracker on someone.
He's a bad guy.

795
00:50:51,384 --> 00:50:53,428
<i>Tracker located.</i>

796
00:50:53,887 --> 00:50:56,139
<i>Plotting course to intercept target.</i>

797
00:50:56,306 --> 00:50:59,392
As long as I make it back
in time for decathlon, it's fine.

798
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,111
<i>One hundred meters
from destination and closing.</i>

799
00:51:10,487 --> 00:51:12,113
<i>Jump now.</i>

800
00:51:16,618 --> 00:51:18,620
<i>Detecting three individuals.</i>

801
00:51:19,537 --> 00:51:22,957
Why is their secret lair
in a gas station? That's so lame.

802
00:51:27,003 --> 00:51:28,755
Hey, suit lady, what are they doing?

803
00:51:28,922 --> 00:51:30,358
<i>Do you want to hear
what they're saying?</i>

804
00:51:30,382 --> 00:51:32,842
I can hear what they're saying? Yeah.

805
00:51:33,009 --> 00:51:34,928
<i>Activating Enhanced
Reconnaissance Mode.</i>

806
00:51:35,095 --> 00:51:38,014
I got the gauntlet from the Lagos cleanup.
The rest is my design.

807
00:51:38,181 --> 00:51:39,516
Whoa, that's so cool.

808
00:51:39,683 --> 00:51:41,661
Can't believe they're still cleaning up
that Triskelion mess.

809
00:51:41,685 --> 00:51:43,687
I love it. They keep making messes...

810
00:51:43,853 --> 00:51:46,231
- ...we keep getting rich.
- Target inbound.

811
00:51:46,398 --> 00:51:48,024
They're in the middle of a heist.

812
00:51:48,191 --> 00:51:50,360
I could catch them red-handed.
This is awesome.

813
00:51:50,527 --> 00:51:52,821
Okay, I'll get closer
to see what's happening.

814
00:51:52,987 --> 00:51:55,699
<i>Would you like me
to engage Enhanced Combat Mode?</i>

815
00:51:55,865 --> 00:51:58,201
"Enhanced Combat Mode"? Yeah.

816
00:51:58,368 --> 00:51:59,828
<i>Activating Instant Kill.</i>

817
00:51:59,994 --> 00:52:02,080
No, no, no. I don't want to kill anybody.

818
00:52:02,247 --> 00:52:04,541
<i>Deactivating Instant Kill.</i>

819
00:52:07,502 --> 00:52:09,254
Did you hear that?

820
00:52:09,671 --> 00:52:11,631
What the hell just happened?
What was that?

821
00:52:11,798 --> 00:52:14,217
<i>You jumped off the sign
and landed on your face.</i>

822
00:52:16,803 --> 00:52:18,163
What's wrong with my web-shooters?

823
00:52:18,263 --> 00:52:20,598
<i>Rapid-fire is the default
for Enhanced Combat Mode.</i>

824
00:52:20,765 --> 00:52:23,476
- Why would I need rapid-fire?
<i>- Would you like to see more options?</i>

825
00:52:23,643 --> 00:52:26,646
<i>You have 576 possible
web-shooter combinations.</i>

826
00:52:27,063 --> 00:52:28,523
Mr. Stark really overdid it.

827
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:29,858
You two wait right here.

828
00:52:30,025 --> 00:52:32,152
Wait. You're gonna want
to turn on the dampers.

829
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:35,655
- That thing will shatter your arm.
- All right, where's the dampers?

830
00:52:35,822 --> 00:52:37,490
- That one.
<i>- Great choice.</i>

831
00:52:37,866 --> 00:52:40,243
<i>Would you like me to set this
as your new default?</i>

832
00:52:41,661 --> 00:52:42,787
No, no, no.

833
00:52:42,954 --> 00:52:45,498
- Push that in. No, the other...
- Here? This one here?

834
00:52:45,665 --> 00:52:48,001
- What was that?
- <i>Taser webs.</i>

835
00:52:48,168 --> 00:52:50,003
Taser webs? I don't want Taser webs.

836
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:52,672
<i>You seem to be unfamiliar
with your web-shooter settings.</i>

837
00:52:53,173 --> 00:52:54,883
<i>Would you like to run
a refresher course?</i>

838
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:57,385
- No. Just... You choose.
<i>- Sure thing.</i>

839
00:52:57,552 --> 00:53:00,221
<i>Six-alpha-niner,
are you running on time?</i>

840
00:53:00,388 --> 00:53:03,850
Copy, central.
Six-alpha-niner on schedule.

841
00:53:06,561 --> 00:53:08,521
- I got a visual.
- Green light, green light.

842
00:53:13,109 --> 00:53:14,402
Oh, that's him.

843
00:53:18,156 --> 00:53:20,200
Okay. I got eyes on the convoy.

844
00:53:20,367 --> 00:53:21,785
Pulling in behind the caboose.

845
00:53:23,578 --> 00:53:24,621
<i>Deploy anchors.</i>

846
00:53:35,423 --> 00:53:36,758
Dropping down.

847
00:53:39,344 --> 00:53:41,262
No outgoing distress signals.
You're clear.

848
00:53:43,223 --> 00:53:46,518
Hey. Looks like they got
some good stuff here.

849
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:57,821
Cool. It's like some kind of
matter phase shifter.

850
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:04,369
All right, coming up.

851
00:54:09,708 --> 00:54:11,835
Hey, Big Bird. This doesn't belong to you.

852
00:54:13,128 --> 00:54:14,629
Oh, God.

853
00:54:21,428 --> 00:54:23,930
- Suit lady, what was that?!
<i>- You told me to choose.</i>

854
00:54:24,931 --> 00:54:27,475
What? No, just set everything
back to normal.

855
00:54:27,976 --> 00:54:29,894
<i>Activating all systems.</i>

856
00:54:46,786 --> 00:54:47,829
My head.

857
00:54:47,996 --> 00:54:50,790
<i>You appear to have a mild concussion.</i>

858
00:54:53,001 --> 00:54:56,171
Hey, so where am I right now?

859
00:54:56,338 --> 00:54:57,464
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

860
00:54:58,006 --> 00:55:00,175
<i>The container walls are hindering
my sensors.</i>

861
00:55:01,843 --> 00:55:03,219
Wait a minute.

862
00:55:03,386 --> 00:55:06,931
They must have hijacked the truck
and taken me to their evil lair.

863
00:55:07,432 --> 00:55:10,852
Okay, suit lady, we're gonna have
to fight our way out of this one.

864
00:55:11,227 --> 00:55:13,271
Three, two, one.

865
00:55:19,819 --> 00:55:21,529
What is this place?

866
00:55:21,696 --> 00:55:22,947
Suit lady, where am I?

867
00:55:23,114 --> 00:55:25,909
<i>You're in the most secure facility
on the eastern seaboard.</i>

868
00:55:26,076 --> 00:55:27,786
<i>The Damage Control deep storage vault.</i>

869
00:55:27,952 --> 00:55:30,455
No. Seriously?

870
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,794
<i>The door will most likely remain closed
until morning.</i>

871
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,253
Morning?

872
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:42,509
Hey, suit lady. I kind of feel bad
calling you "suit lady," you know?

873
00:55:42,676 --> 00:55:44,969
I think I should probably give you a name.

874
00:55:45,136 --> 00:55:47,472
Like Liz. No, no, no.

875
00:55:47,639 --> 00:55:49,641
God, that's... That's weird.

876
00:55:49,808 --> 00:55:52,185
What about Karen?

877
00:55:52,602 --> 00:55:54,437
<i>You can call me Karen
if you would like.</i>

878
00:55:54,604 --> 00:55:57,732
Hey, Karen, what else can this suit do?

879
00:55:58,650 --> 00:55:59,818
What?

880
00:55:59,984 --> 00:56:01,903
Maybe we should run
that refresher course.

881
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:04,239
<i>- Ricochet web.
</i>-Ricochet web.

882
00:56:04,406 --> 00:56:07,283
- Cool.
<i>- Splitter web.</i>

883
00:56:08,451 --> 00:56:11,329
<i>- Web grenade.
</i>-Web grenade!

884
00:56:13,081 --> 00:56:15,750
Should I tell Liz that I'm Spider-Man?

885
00:56:15,917 --> 00:56:16,960
<i>Who is Liz?</i>

886
00:56:17,127 --> 00:56:19,796
Who's Liz? She's...

887
00:56:19,963 --> 00:56:21,423
She's the best. She's awesome.

888
00:56:21,589 --> 00:56:24,300
She's just a girl who goes to my school.

889
00:56:24,467 --> 00:56:25,510
And...

890
00:56:25,677 --> 00:56:29,597
Yeah, I just... I really want to tell her,
but it's kind of weird, you know?

891
00:56:29,764 --> 00:56:32,976
"Hey, I'm Spider-Man."

892
00:56:33,143 --> 00:56:34,269
<i>What's weird about that?</i>

893
00:56:34,436 --> 00:56:36,479
What if she's expecting
someone like Tony Stark?

894
00:56:36,646 --> 00:56:38,648
Imagine how disappointed
she'd be when she sees me.

895
00:56:38,815 --> 00:56:42,360
<i>Well, if I were her,
I wouldn't be disappointed at all.</i>

896
00:56:42,527 --> 00:56:44,029
Thanks, Karen.

897
00:56:44,195 --> 00:56:46,948
It's really nice
to have somebody to talk to.

898
00:56:47,115 --> 00:56:48,950
Hey, how long we been here anyways?

899
00:56:49,117 --> 00:56:50,994
<i>- Thirty-seven minutes.
</i>-What?!

900
00:56:51,161 --> 00:56:52,871
Thirty-seven minutes? That's insane.

901
00:56:53,038 --> 00:56:56,708
I cannot take this anymore.
I got to... I gotta get out of here.

902
00:56:58,626 --> 00:57:01,463
There's got to be something in here
I can use.

903
00:57:02,505 --> 00:57:04,257
Okay, let's see.

904
00:57:04,424 --> 00:57:05,967
Nope.

905
00:57:07,177 --> 00:57:08,345
That's awesome.

906
00:57:09,971 --> 00:57:11,431
Hey, it's like the glowy thing.

907
00:57:11,598 --> 00:57:14,601
<i>That glowy thing is
an explosive Chitauri energy core.</i>

908
00:57:14,768 --> 00:57:16,770
You mean, we've been
carrying around a bomb?

909
00:57:16,936 --> 00:57:20,648
<i>It would require radiation
to transform it into an explosive state.</i>

910
00:57:21,649 --> 00:57:23,485
No, no, no.

911
00:57:27,364 --> 00:57:30,241
Hey! Please!
Please, somebody let me out! Hey!

912
00:57:30,408 --> 00:57:32,408
Karen, you have to help me override
that time lock.

913
00:57:33,078 --> 00:57:35,080
Okay, Karen, lower the voltage and run it.

914
00:57:35,246 --> 00:57:36,748
<i>Trial unsuccessful.</i>

915
00:57:36,915 --> 00:57:39,584
Okay, we're just gonna have
to try every sequence.

916
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:45,298
Ned, Peter, we're gonna be late.
Come on, let's go.

917
00:57:45,465 --> 00:57:47,759
Okay. Hold on, hold on.

918
00:57:51,554 --> 00:57:54,641
<i>Initiating trial 247.</i>

919
00:57:55,183 --> 00:57:56,559
It worked. It works.

920
00:58:08,988 --> 00:58:12,617
Please be sure
all cell phones are turned off.

921
00:58:12,784 --> 00:58:13,827
Thank you.

922
00:58:13,993 --> 00:58:15,870
Karen, get me to decathlon
as fast as possible.

923
00:58:16,037 --> 00:58:17,306
<i>Sure thing. Just tell me where it is.</i>

924
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:19,141
Across the street
from the Washington Monument.

925
00:58:19,165 --> 00:58:22,127
<i>- It's Ned. Leave a message.
</i>-Call me back. The glowy thing's a bomb!

926
00:58:27,757 --> 00:58:30,093
<i>There's a vehicle approaching
on your right.</i>

927
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:32,470
We have now entered sudden death.

928
00:58:32,637 --> 00:58:35,432
The next correct answer wins
the championship.

929
00:58:39,769 --> 00:58:41,688
Midtown Tech?

930
00:58:41,855 --> 00:58:43,481
Zero.

931
00:58:43,648 --> 00:58:44,691
That is correct.

932
00:58:45,442 --> 00:58:47,736
Midtown takes the championship.

933
00:58:49,237 --> 00:58:51,239
- We won.
- You guys, I am so proud of you.

934
00:58:51,406 --> 00:58:54,576
- Told you we didn't need Peter.
- Flash, you didn't answer a question.

935
00:58:54,743 --> 00:58:57,704
- Taking it all in, Michelle?
- Oh, yeah, I just...

936
00:58:57,871 --> 00:59:00,271
I don't want to celebrate something
that was built by slaves.

937
00:59:00,373 --> 00:59:02,834
I'm sure the Washington Monument
wasn't built by...

938
00:59:06,296 --> 00:59:07,339
Okay.

939
00:59:07,797 --> 00:59:09,966
- Enjoy your book.
- Thanks.

940
00:59:12,510 --> 00:59:15,013
- Oh, Ned, you're alive.
- Peter, are you okay?

941
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:16,780
Where's the glowy thing?
The glowy thing?

942
00:59:16,931 --> 00:59:20,518
- It's safe. It's in my backpack.
- Ned, listen, the glowy thing is dangerous.

943
00:59:20,685 --> 00:59:22,405
You missed the decathlon.
I covered for you.

944
00:59:22,437 --> 00:59:24,356
- Listen.
- We're at the Washington Monument.

945
00:59:24,522 --> 00:59:25,899
- Peter, is that you?
- Hey, Liz.

946
00:59:26,066 --> 00:59:27,626
<i>- Is that Liz?
</i>-Put Ned back on the phone.

947
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:30,779
<i>- You should tell her how you feel.
</i>-You flake. You are lucky we won.

948
00:59:30,945 --> 00:59:34,532
I want to be mad, but I'm more worried.
Like, what is going on with you?

949
00:59:34,699 --> 00:59:36,219
I have to talk to Ned. It's important.

950
00:59:36,368 --> 00:59:38,763
- All items on the belt, please.
<i>- There's something in Ned's backpack.</i>

951
00:59:38,787 --> 00:59:40,872
<i>It's dangerous.
Don't let it go through x-ray.</i>

952
00:59:43,792 --> 00:59:45,960
Liz? Liz! Damn it.

953
00:59:49,464 --> 00:59:51,758
Can I be the one
to tell Peter he's expelled?

954
00:59:55,970 --> 01:00:01,726
The Washington Monument is 555 feet,
five and one-eighth inches tall.

955
01:00:03,478 --> 01:00:06,481
Notice how the marble and granite
are cut around the stone.

956
01:00:13,905 --> 01:00:16,324
No, no, no.
Karen, what's going on up there?

957
01:00:17,325 --> 01:00:18,827
<i>The Chitauri core has detonated...</i>

958
01:00:18,993 --> 01:00:21,138
<i>...and caused severe structural damage
to the elevator.</i>

959
01:00:21,162 --> 01:00:22,515
- Oh, no.
- My friends are up there.

960
01:00:22,539 --> 01:00:25,083
What? Don't worry, ma'am,
everything's gonna be okay.

961
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:27,335
Excuse me, excuse me.
Oh, my God, that's tall.

962
01:00:33,425 --> 01:00:34,926
Oh, my God. Look at the ceiling.

963
01:00:35,093 --> 01:00:36,594
Just stay calm, everyone.

964
01:00:36,761 --> 01:00:38,430
Oh, we are all going to die here.

965
01:00:41,057 --> 01:00:43,727
<i>Estimating 10 minutes
before catastrophic failure.</i>

966
01:00:43,893 --> 01:00:45,395
We're freaking screwed.

967
01:00:45,562 --> 01:00:48,690
Okay, I know that was scary,
but our safety systems are working.

968
01:00:48,857 --> 01:00:51,276
<i>The safety systems
are completely failing.</i>

969
01:00:51,443 --> 01:00:53,111
We're very safe in here.

970
01:00:53,278 --> 01:00:55,864
<i>The occupants are
in imminent mortal danger.</i>

971
01:00:56,031 --> 01:00:57,115
Going as fast as I can!

972
01:01:06,833 --> 01:01:08,168
- Let's go.
- Give me your hand.

973
01:01:09,586 --> 01:01:11,880
<i>You now have 125 seconds
until catastrophic failure.</i>

974
01:01:12,047 --> 01:01:13,089
What?! Why?

975
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:16,593
<i>Unexpected motion has caused
the deterioration to escalate.</i>

976
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:20,221
- How do I get in there?
<i>- Activating reconnaissance drone.</i>

977
01:01:22,849 --> 01:01:24,976
Has that been there this whole time?
That's awesome.

978
01:01:25,435 --> 01:01:27,687
<i>Locating optimal entry point.</i>

979
01:01:29,397 --> 01:01:31,066
<i>Proceed to southwest window.</i>

980
01:01:31,232 --> 01:01:32,984
Karen, I'm on my way.

981
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:39,532
- There's a lot of glass here.
- You got this.

982
01:01:39,699 --> 01:01:40,909
Keep coming, keep coming.

983
01:01:54,964 --> 01:01:56,966
Okay. Oh, my God.

984
01:01:57,133 --> 01:01:58,802
Okay.

985
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:02,514
<i>What's wrong? You've reached
the southwest window.</i>

986
01:02:02,681 --> 01:02:04,432
<i>- Why are you hesitating?
</i>-It's fine.

987
01:02:04,599 --> 01:02:06,309
I've just never been this high before.

988
01:02:06,476 --> 01:02:08,645
<i>You have also not reinstalled
your parachute...</i>

989
01:02:08,812 --> 01:02:11,523
<i>...so a fall from this height
would most likely be lethal.</i>

990
01:02:13,149 --> 01:02:14,609
Perfect.

991
01:02:14,776 --> 01:02:16,361
Oh, my God.

992
01:02:17,904 --> 01:02:19,030
Why is it not breaking?

993
01:02:19,197 --> 01:02:22,867
<i>It's four-inch ballistic glass.
You'll have to create more momentum.</i>

994
01:02:42,095 --> 01:02:44,431
This is D.C. Metro Police.
Identify yourself.

995
01:02:44,597 --> 01:02:46,182
My friends are in there! Stop!

996
01:02:46,349 --> 01:02:48,101
Return to the ground immediately.

997
01:02:48,268 --> 01:02:50,270
- Okay, who's next?
- Me, it's my turn.

998
01:02:50,437 --> 01:02:52,272
Flash, seriously? What are you doing?

999
01:02:52,439 --> 01:02:55,400
- Come on.
- Don't worry about the trophy.

1000
01:03:02,866 --> 01:03:04,034
Stand down!

1001
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,953
Return to the ground immediately.

1002
01:03:11,124 --> 01:03:13,126
Return to the ground
or we will open fire!

1003
01:03:13,293 --> 01:03:15,128
Go up, go up.

1004
01:03:15,962 --> 01:03:17,339
I got this.

1005
01:03:17,505 --> 01:03:19,174
Take my trophy.

1006
01:03:21,009 --> 01:03:23,219
This is your last chance.

1007
01:03:23,386 --> 01:03:25,430
I'm gonna die.

1008
01:03:34,189 --> 01:03:35,189
Break!

1009
01:03:49,329 --> 01:03:50,997
I did it.

1010
01:04:04,594 --> 01:04:06,554
Hey, how you doing?
Don't worry. I got you.

1011
01:04:07,013 --> 01:04:09,557
- Yes! Yes.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1012
01:04:09,724 --> 01:04:11,810
- Big guy, quit moving around.
- I'm sorry, sir.

1013
01:04:15,438 --> 01:04:16,481
Let's go, let's go!

1014
01:04:22,362 --> 01:04:23,405
Okay, okay.

1015
01:04:23,571 --> 01:04:25,532
- Mr. Harrington, go.
- Ned, come on.

1016
01:04:25,699 --> 01:04:27,492
- This is your stop.
- Come on, Liz.

1017
01:04:27,659 --> 01:04:30,578
Go, go, go. Everybody out.
Move it, people. Move it, move it.

1018
01:04:30,745 --> 01:04:32,247
- Are you sure it's safe?
- Liz.

1019
01:04:33,164 --> 01:04:34,374
Liz!

1020
01:04:38,586 --> 01:04:40,255
You're okay. You're okay.

1021
01:04:43,758 --> 01:04:45,135
Okay.

1022
01:04:45,677 --> 01:04:46,970
- Oh, my God.
- Good, good.

1023
01:04:47,137 --> 01:04:49,014
Come on up.
Come on, you guys, stay back.

1024
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:51,182
- Come on in.
- You guys good?

1025
01:04:51,349 --> 01:04:52,726
So is everyone okay?

1026
01:04:54,185 --> 01:04:56,187
<i>This is your chance, Peter.</i>

1027
01:04:56,354 --> 01:04:58,189
<i>Kiss her.</i>

1028
01:05:01,943 --> 01:05:03,611
Thank you.

1029
01:05:06,614 --> 01:05:09,159
Are you really friends with Peter Parker?

1030
01:05:16,124 --> 01:05:21,004
I can finish the next order, but without
any new materials from that truck....

1031
01:05:21,588 --> 01:05:23,757
Yeah, damn it.

1032
01:05:24,257 --> 01:05:26,497
We still have enough to do
the Gargan deal though, right?

1033
01:05:26,634 --> 01:05:28,636
Yeah, but then that's it.

1034
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:34,851
Maybe it is time
that I built the high-altitude seal.

1035
01:05:35,018 --> 01:05:36,746
- Would you shut up about that?
- It's only one job.

1036
01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:38,271
No.

1037
01:05:39,773 --> 01:05:43,026
Eight years, not a word from the feds,
nothing from those...

1038
01:05:43,193 --> 01:05:47,238
...Halloween-costume-wearing bozos
up there in Stark Tower.

1039
01:05:47,405 --> 01:05:52,118
And then all of a sudden,
this little bastard in red tights shows up.

1040
01:05:52,285 --> 01:05:55,955
And he thinks he can tear down
everything I've built.

1041
01:05:57,457 --> 01:05:59,000
Really?

1042
01:06:00,168 --> 01:06:01,336
I'm gonna kill him.

1043
01:06:01,503 --> 01:06:03,546
- I'm gonna find him...
- Found him.

1044
01:06:03,713 --> 01:06:05,006
<i>The Spider-Man swooped in...</i>

1045
01:06:05,173 --> 01:06:08,093
<i>...heroically saving an Academic
Decathlon team from Queens.</i>

1046
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:11,471
<i>The identity of the masked hero
is still unknown.</i>

1047
01:06:13,932 --> 01:06:16,476
- Mom.
- Oh, kids. All right.

1048
01:06:16,643 --> 01:06:19,145
Peter. Come here,
come here, come here.

1049
01:06:23,066 --> 01:06:25,568
<i>This past weekend,
Midtown's Academic Decathlon team...</i>

1050
01:06:25,735 --> 01:06:28,697
<i>...defeated the country's best
to win the national championship.</i>

1051
01:06:28,863 --> 01:06:30,532
<i>Later that day,
they also defeated death.</i>

1052
01:06:30,699 --> 01:06:33,118
<i>Explosion. Sally scream.
Flash scream. Everybody screaming.</i>

1053
01:06:33,284 --> 01:06:37,080
<i>There were purple lasers and smoke.
It was **** tight, like a Bon Jovi concert.</i>

1054
01:06:37,247 --> 01:06:40,625
<i>As you know, we made it out alive,
and that's the important thing.</i>

1055
01:06:40,792 --> 01:06:43,878
<i>I couldn't bear to lose
a student on a school trip.</i>

1056
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:46,172
<i>Not again.</i>

1057
01:06:46,339 --> 01:06:50,051
<i>Thankfully, no one was seriously injured
thanks to the Spider-Man.</i>

1058
01:06:50,677 --> 01:06:52,597
<i>- Thank you, Spider-Man.
- Thank you, Spider-Man.</i>

1059
01:06:52,637 --> 01:06:55,557
<i>Up next: the Spider-Man mania
is sweeping the school.</i>

1060
01:06:55,724 --> 01:06:58,351
<i>How can you show your spider spirit?</i>

1061
01:07:02,272 --> 01:07:04,190
Dude, dude, dude.

1062
01:07:04,357 --> 01:07:07,068
What is it like being famous
when nobody knows it's you?

1063
01:07:07,235 --> 01:07:08,695
- Crazy, dude.
- It's crazy.

1064
01:07:08,862 --> 01:07:10,697
- Should we tell everyone?
- No.

1065
01:07:10,864 --> 01:07:13,658
- Should I tell everyone?
- No, dude. That's not a good idea.

1066
01:07:14,075 --> 01:07:17,162
- Okay, come on, we'll be late to class.
- I'm not going to class.

1067
01:07:17,328 --> 01:07:19,223
You're already in trouble
for ditching the decathlon.

1068
01:07:19,247 --> 01:07:20,790
Dude, listen, I figured it out.

1069
01:07:20,957 --> 01:07:22,877
The wingsuit guy is stealing
from Damage Control.

1070
01:07:23,043 --> 01:07:26,046
What he takes from Damage Control,
that's how he builds the weapons.

1071
01:07:26,212 --> 01:07:29,132
- So all I gotta do is catch him.
- But we have a Spanish quiz.

1072
01:07:29,299 --> 01:07:31,509
Ned, I'm probably never gonna
come back here.

1073
01:07:31,676 --> 01:07:34,721
Mr. Stark is moving
the Avengers upstate...

1074
01:07:34,888 --> 01:07:36,848
- ...so when I bring this guy in...
- Dude.

1075
01:07:37,015 --> 01:07:38,933
You want to be a high school dropout?

1076
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:41,770
I am so far beyond high school right now.

1077
01:07:41,936 --> 01:07:44,647
Parker, my office.

1078
01:07:47,317 --> 01:07:48,943
<i>So...</i>

1079
01:07:49,110 --> 01:07:50,612
<i>...you got detention.</i>

1080
01:07:50,779 --> 01:07:52,947
<i>You screwed up.
You know what you did was wrong.</i>

1081
01:07:53,114 --> 01:07:55,492
<i>The question is,
how are you gonna make things right?</i>

1082
01:07:55,658 --> 01:07:56,978
<i>Maybe you were trying to be cool.</i>

1083
01:07:57,535 --> 01:08:00,205
<i>But take it from a guy
who's been frozen for 65 years...</i>

1084
01:08:00,372 --> 01:08:03,500
<i>...the only way to really be cool
is to follow the rules.</i>

1085
01:08:04,501 --> 01:08:07,128
<i>We all know what's right.
We all know what's wrong.</i>

1086
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:09,839
<i>Next time those turkeys try
to convince you of something...</i>

1087
01:08:10,006 --> 01:08:12,287
- <i>...you know is wrong...
</i>-Where you going? Get back here.

1088
01:08:12,425 --> 01:08:14,803
<i>...just think to yourself,
what would Captain America do?</i>

1089
01:08:14,969 --> 01:08:16,763
Why are you here?
You don't have detention.

1090
01:08:16,930 --> 01:08:20,517
Oh, I know. I just like coming here
to sketch people in crisis.

1091
01:08:23,728 --> 01:08:25,271
It's you.

1092
01:08:25,772 --> 01:08:29,526
<i>So your body's changing.
Believe me, I know how that feels.</i>

1093
01:08:41,121 --> 01:08:42,789
May?

1094
01:08:46,292 --> 01:08:47,335
Hey, Karen. What's up?

1095
01:08:47,502 --> 01:08:49,295
<i>Hey, Peter.
How was your Spanish quiz?</i>

1096
01:08:49,462 --> 01:08:50,690
I was wondering if you could help me.

1097
01:08:50,714 --> 01:08:53,359
I'm trying to figure out who the guys
under the bridge were that night...

1098
01:08:53,383 --> 01:08:55,844
...but I can only remember
part of a license plate.

1099
01:08:56,011 --> 01:08:58,805
<i>I can run facial recognition
on the footage of that encounter.</i>

1100
01:08:58,972 --> 01:09:00,473
- Footage?
<i>- Yes, Peter.</i>

1101
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,517
<i>I record everything you see.</i>

1102
01:09:02,684 --> 01:09:03,810
- Everything?
<i>- Everything.</i>

1103
01:09:03,977 --> 01:09:06,312
- All the time?
<i>- It's called the Baby-Monitor Protocol.</i>

1104
01:09:07,105 --> 01:09:09,024
Yeah, of course it is.

1105
01:09:10,233 --> 01:09:13,069
- Yeah, just roll it back to last Friday.
<i>- With pleasure.</i>

1106
01:09:13,236 --> 01:09:15,113
<i>Hey, everyone. Yeah, kick-ass party.</i>

1107
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:17,866
<i>Hey, what's up, Liz?
Peter's told me a lot about you.</i>

1108
01:09:18,033 --> 01:09:19,993
No, no, no.
This is just me messing around.

1109
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:21,870
Go later in the day, later in the day.

1110
01:09:22,037 --> 01:09:24,205
<i>It is I, Thor, son of Odin.</i>

1111
01:09:24,372 --> 01:09:25,832
No, no, no. That's definitely...

1112
01:09:25,999 --> 01:09:27,727
That's definitely not
what we wanted to watch.

1113
01:09:27,751 --> 01:09:31,254
<i>- Your impressions are very funny.
</i>-Fast-forward to the arms deal.

1114
01:09:31,421 --> 01:09:32,714
Okay.

1115
01:09:32,881 --> 01:09:36,384
- The two on the right, who are they?
<i>- Searching law enforcement databases.</i>

1116
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:39,262
<i>No records found
for two of the individuals.</i>

1117
01:09:39,429 --> 01:09:41,514
- Nothing?
<i>- One individual identified.</i>

1118
01:09:41,681 --> 01:09:43,808
<i>Aaron Davis, age 33.</i>

1119
01:09:43,975 --> 01:09:46,811
<i>He has a criminal record
and an address here in Queens.</i>

1120
01:09:46,978 --> 01:09:48,229
Let's pay him a visit.

1121
01:09:48,396 --> 01:09:51,733
<i>Would you like me to activate
the Enhanced Interrogation Protocol?</i>

1122
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:52,984
Yeah.

1123
01:10:08,208 --> 01:10:09,959
- Remember me?
- Hey...

1124
01:10:10,126 --> 01:10:11,961
I need information.
You'll give it to me now.

1125
01:10:12,128 --> 01:10:13,838
- All right, chill.
- Come on!

1126
01:10:14,589 --> 01:10:17,217
- What happened to your voice?
- What do you mean?

1127
01:10:17,384 --> 01:10:19,612
I heard you by the bridge.
I know what a girl sound like.

1128
01:10:19,636 --> 01:10:22,597
I'm not a girl. I'm a boy.
I mean, I'm a... I'm a man.

1129
01:10:22,764 --> 01:10:24,599
I don't care what you are, a boy, a girl...

1130
01:10:24,766 --> 01:10:26,434
I'm not a girl. I'm a man.

1131
01:10:26,601 --> 01:10:28,937
Come on, man.
Look, who is selling these weapons?

1132
01:10:29,312 --> 01:10:31,398
I need to know. Give me names or else.

1133
01:10:35,068 --> 01:10:39,364
- You ain't ever done this before, huh?
- Deactivate Interrogation Mode.

1134
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:41,783
Look, man.

1135
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:45,161
These guys are selling weapons
that are crazy dangerous.

1136
01:10:45,328 --> 01:10:46,746
They can't be out on the streets.

1137
01:10:46,913 --> 01:10:49,082
If one of them can cut
Delmar's Bodega in half...

1138
01:10:49,249 --> 01:10:51,835
- You know Delmar's?
- Yeah, best sandwich in Queens.

1139
01:10:52,002 --> 01:10:54,212
- Sub Haven's pretty good.
- It's too much bread.

1140
01:10:54,379 --> 01:10:56,506
- I like bread.
- Come on, man, please.

1141
01:10:58,842 --> 01:11:01,553
Stupid Interrogation Mode.
Karen, don't ever do that again.

1142
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:05,181
The other night, you told that dude,
"If you shoot somebody, shoot me."

1143
01:11:05,348 --> 01:11:06,808
That's pretty ballsy.

1144
01:11:06,975 --> 01:11:09,019
I don't want those weapons
in this neighborhood.

1145
01:11:09,185 --> 01:11:10,562
I got a nephew who live here.

1146
01:11:11,771 --> 01:11:13,023
Who are these guys?

1147
01:11:13,189 --> 01:11:15,149
What can you tell me
about the guy with the wings?

1148
01:11:15,275 --> 01:11:17,595
Other than he's a psychopath
dressed like a demon, nothing.

1149
01:11:17,694 --> 01:11:19,654
I don't know who he is
or where he is.

1150
01:11:22,532 --> 01:11:26,119
- I do know where he's gonna be.
- Really?

1151
01:11:26,286 --> 01:11:28,538
Yeah, this crazy dude
I used to work with...

1152
01:11:28,705 --> 01:11:31,124
...he's supposed
to be doing a deal with him.

1153
01:11:31,291 --> 01:11:32,917
Yes! Yes.

1154
01:11:33,084 --> 01:11:34,669
- Thank...
- Hey. Hey. Hey.

1155
01:11:34,836 --> 01:11:37,130
I didn't tell you where.
You don't have a location.

1156
01:11:37,297 --> 01:11:39,799
Right, of course.
Yeah, my bad. Silly. Just...

1157
01:11:39,966 --> 01:11:41,217
Yeah.

1158
01:11:41,384 --> 01:11:43,553
- Where is it?
- Can I give you some advice?

1159
01:11:44,512 --> 01:11:46,765
You got to get better
at this part of the job.

1160
01:11:46,931 --> 01:11:48,391
I don't understand.

1161
01:11:48,558 --> 01:11:49,934
I'm intimidating.

1162
01:11:50,101 --> 01:11:52,979
- Staten Island Ferry, 11.
- Oh, that's soon.

1163
01:11:53,146 --> 01:11:54,856
That's gonna dissolve in two hours.

1164
01:11:55,023 --> 01:11:57,609
No, no, no. Come fix this.

1165
01:11:57,776 --> 01:11:59,587
- Two hours. You deserve that.
- I got ice cream in here.

1166
01:11:59,611 --> 01:12:02,197
You deserve that. You're a criminal.
Bye, Mr. Criminal.

1167
01:12:16,836 --> 01:12:18,129
Nice.

1168
01:12:21,424 --> 01:12:24,052
Okay, Karen, activate
Enhanced Reconnaissance Mode.

1169
01:12:24,219 --> 01:12:25,261
<i>Sure thing.</i>

1170
01:12:25,637 --> 01:12:27,764
He's up front, main deck.

1171
01:12:27,931 --> 01:12:29,349
I hate this guy.

1172
01:12:29,516 --> 01:12:31,851
It's the guy from the bridge, right?
Who's that other guy?

1173
01:12:32,018 --> 01:12:33,645
Just keep me posted.

1174
01:12:33,812 --> 01:12:35,732
<i>There's no record of him
in my criminal database.</i>

1175
01:12:35,855 --> 01:12:38,668
<i>Incoming call from May Parker. Should
I reroute to your heads-up display?</i>

1176
01:12:38,692 --> 01:12:41,111
I can't talk right now. I'll call her back.

1177
01:12:41,986 --> 01:12:46,366
Hey, dronie, keep an eye on that guy.
We can't let anybody get away this time.

1178
01:12:54,624 --> 01:12:56,710
- Who's the guy on the left?
<i>- Mac Gargan.</i>

1179
01:12:56,876 --> 01:12:59,295
<i>Extensive criminal record,
including homicide.</i>

1180
01:12:59,462 --> 01:13:01,297
<i>Would you like me
to activate Instant Kill?</i>

1181
01:13:01,464 --> 01:13:04,884
No, Karen, stop it
with the Instant Kill already.

1182
01:13:06,094 --> 01:13:08,388
White pickup truck.

1183
01:13:12,726 --> 01:13:15,020
Dronie, scan the ship
for a white pickup truck.

1184
01:13:35,915 --> 01:13:37,167
Oh, this is too perfect.

1185
01:13:37,334 --> 01:13:39,669
I got the weapons, buyers
and sellers in one place.

1186
01:13:39,836 --> 01:13:42,797
<i>- Incoming call from Tony Stark.
</i>-No, no, no.

1187
01:13:42,964 --> 01:13:45,133
- Don't answer.
<i>- Mr. Parker. Got a sec?</i>

1188
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:47,719
- I'm actually at school.
<i>- No, you're not.</i>

1189
01:13:47,886 --> 01:13:49,763
<i>- Nice work in D.C.
</i>-Okay.

1190
01:13:49,929 --> 01:13:52,640
<i>My dad never really gave me
a lot of support...</i>

1191
01:13:52,807 --> 01:13:54,976
<i>...and I'm trying to break
the cycle of shame.</i>

1192
01:13:55,143 --> 01:13:56,383
I'm in the middle of something.

1193
01:13:56,478 --> 01:13:57,997
<i>Don't cut me off
when I'm complimenting you.</i>

1194
01:13:58,021 --> 01:14:01,149
<i>Anyway, great things are about to...
What is that?</i>

1195
01:14:02,108 --> 01:14:03,777
I'm at band practice.

1196
01:14:03,943 --> 01:14:08,615
<i>That's odd. Happy told me you quit
band six weeks ago. What's up?</i>

1197
01:14:08,782 --> 01:14:10,992
- I gotta go. End call.
<i>- Hey.</i>

1198
01:14:11,159 --> 01:14:12,285
I'll take those!

1199
01:14:15,914 --> 01:14:19,250
Hey, guys. The illegal weapons-deal ferry
was at 10:30. You missed it.

1200
01:14:28,259 --> 01:14:29,886
<i>Spider guy's here.</i>

1201
01:14:33,056 --> 01:14:35,058
Not so fast.

1202
01:14:35,892 --> 01:14:39,187
Are you guys okay?
My bad. That was a little hard.

1203
01:14:39,729 --> 01:14:42,899
I got to say, the other guy was way better
with that thing.

1204
01:14:43,358 --> 01:14:44,567
I'm honestly...

1205
01:14:44,734 --> 01:14:46,695
I'm... I'm shocked.

1206
01:14:58,748 --> 01:15:00,709
- Freeze! FBI.
- Don't move.

1207
01:15:00,875 --> 01:15:02,669
- Get on the ground.
- FBI.

1208
01:15:02,836 --> 01:15:03,878
What do you mean, FBI?

1209
01:15:04,045 --> 01:15:07,465
- <i>The Federal Bureau of Investigation.
</i>-I know, but what are they doing here?

1210
01:15:15,432 --> 01:15:17,517
Get out of the way. Get out of the way!

1211
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:19,811
No.

1212
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:24,524
Look out, look out, look out.
Move, move, move!

1213
01:15:30,155 --> 01:15:31,531
- Move.
- Get to the top deck.

1214
01:15:31,698 --> 01:15:33,241
We're getting out of here.

1215
01:16:12,322 --> 01:16:14,407
Activate Taser web!

1216
01:16:25,835 --> 01:16:28,880
You're messing with things
you don't understand.

1217
01:17:08,253 --> 01:17:10,046
Oh, my God. What do I do? Karen...

1218
01:17:10,213 --> 01:17:13,466
...give me an x-ray of the boat
and target all the strongest points.

1219
01:17:16,302 --> 01:17:18,346
Web grenade. Web grenade.

1220
01:17:20,181 --> 01:17:22,392
Splitter web, go.

1221
01:17:50,462 --> 01:17:53,590
<i>Great job, Peter.
You are 98 percent successful.</i>

1222
01:17:53,757 --> 01:17:57,010
- Ninety-eight?
- Yeah, Spider-Man!

1223
01:17:58,178 --> 01:18:00,764
No, no, no.

1224
01:18:35,382 --> 01:18:37,008
What the hell?

1225
01:18:40,428 --> 01:18:42,305
What the hell?

1226
01:18:44,099 --> 01:18:45,809
<i>Hi, Spider-Man.</i>

1227
01:18:45,975 --> 01:18:48,353
<i>Band practice, was it?</i>

1228
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,210
Yeah, Iron Man!

1229
01:19:19,801 --> 01:19:21,386
Mr. Stark.

1230
01:19:22,929 --> 01:19:26,391
Hey, Mr. Stark, could I do anything?
What do you want me to do?

1231
01:19:27,183 --> 01:19:29,436
<i>I think you've done enough.</i>

1232
01:19:43,575 --> 01:19:46,828
So that's it. You're just gonna run?

1233
01:19:49,205 --> 01:19:51,666
Feds were waiting for us.

1234
01:19:51,833 --> 01:19:54,502
Now we're on Iron Man's radar?

1235
01:19:55,128 --> 01:19:56,921
Yeah, I'm running.

1236
01:19:57,714 --> 01:19:58,882
You should too.

1237
01:19:59,424 --> 01:20:01,259
You know I can't do that.

1238
01:20:01,426 --> 01:20:02,635
So now what?

1239
01:20:03,053 --> 01:20:07,766
Mason, can you get that high-altitude
seal thing up and running in time?

1240
01:20:08,558 --> 01:20:09,934
Seriously?

1241
01:20:10,101 --> 01:20:12,270
Yes. You will not regret this.

1242
01:20:15,732 --> 01:20:17,233
You in?

1243
01:20:27,869 --> 01:20:29,954
<i>Previously on </i>Peter Screws the Pooch...

1244
01:20:30,121 --> 01:20:31,831
<i>...I tell you to stay away from this.</i>

1245
01:20:31,998 --> 01:20:34,626
<i>Instead, you hacked
a multimillion-dollar suit...</i>

1246
01:20:34,793 --> 01:20:37,045
<i>...so you could sneak around
behind my back...</i>

1247
01:20:37,212 --> 01:20:40,048
<i>...doing the one thing
I told you not to do.</i>

1248
01:20:40,215 --> 01:20:41,216
Is everyone okay?

1249
01:20:42,092 --> 01:20:44,594
<i>No thanks to you.</i>

1250
01:20:45,387 --> 01:20:47,389
No thanks to me?

1251
01:20:48,932 --> 01:20:51,559
Those weapons were out there,
and I tried to tell you about it...

1252
01:20:51,726 --> 01:20:53,103
...but you didn't listen.

1253
01:20:53,269 --> 01:20:56,690
None of this would've happened
if you had just listened to me.

1254
01:20:56,856 --> 01:20:58,900
If you even cared, you'd actually be here.

1255
01:21:03,446 --> 01:21:06,533
I did listen, kid.
Who do you think called the FBI, huh?

1256
01:21:06,908 --> 01:21:09,285
Do you know I was the only one
who believed in you?

1257
01:21:09,452 --> 01:21:13,248
Everyone else said I was crazy
to recruit a 14-year-old kid.

1258
01:21:13,415 --> 01:21:15,709
- I'm 15.
- No, this is where you zip it, all right?

1259
01:21:15,875 --> 01:21:18,461
The adult is talking.
What if somebody had died tonight?

1260
01:21:18,628 --> 01:21:21,715
Different story, right?
Because that's on you.

1261
01:21:21,881 --> 01:21:23,216
And if you died...

1262
01:21:23,383 --> 01:21:25,593
...I feel like that's on me.

1263
01:21:25,927 --> 01:21:27,847
- I don't need that on my conscience.
- Yes, sir.

1264
01:21:27,971 --> 01:21:30,598
- I'm sorry. I understand.
- Sorry doesn't cut it.

1265
01:21:31,224 --> 01:21:33,143
I just wanted to be like you.

1266
01:21:33,309 --> 01:21:34,853
And I wanted you to be better.

1267
01:21:36,604 --> 01:21:38,982
It's not working out.
I'm gonna need the suit back.

1268
01:21:39,149 --> 01:21:41,359
- For how long?
- Forever.

1269
01:21:41,526 --> 01:21:43,570
- Yeah, that's how it works.
- No, no. Please.

1270
01:21:43,737 --> 01:21:45,655
- Let's have it.
- Please, this is all I have.

1271
01:21:45,822 --> 01:21:47,198
I'm nothing without this suit.

1272
01:21:47,949 --> 01:21:50,469
If you're nothing without this suit,
then you shouldn't have it.

1273
01:21:50,535 --> 01:21:51,703
Okay?

1274
01:21:51,870 --> 01:21:54,080
God, I sound like my dad.

1275
01:21:56,124 --> 01:21:58,001
I don't have any other clothes.

1276
01:21:58,668 --> 01:22:00,670
Okay, we'll sort that out.

1277
01:22:10,847 --> 01:22:12,223
Hey.

1278
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:20,357
I've been calling you all day.
You didn't answer your phone.

1279
01:22:20,523 --> 01:22:21,983
You can't do that.

1280
01:22:22,150 --> 01:22:24,778
Then this ferry thing happens.

1281
01:22:24,944 --> 01:22:27,614
I've called five police stations.

1282
01:22:27,781 --> 01:22:28,990
Five.

1283
01:22:29,157 --> 01:22:31,093
I called five of your friends.
I called Ned's mother.

1284
01:22:31,117 --> 01:22:34,746
I'm fine. May, I'm okay.
Honestly, just relax. I'm fine.

1285
01:22:35,663 --> 01:22:36,706
Cut the bullshit.

1286
01:22:36,873 --> 01:22:38,541
I know you left detention.

1287
01:22:38,708 --> 01:22:41,211
I know you left the hotel room
in Washington.

1288
01:22:41,378 --> 01:22:43,296
I know you sneak out
of this house every night.

1289
01:22:43,463 --> 01:22:44,756
That's not fine.

1290
01:22:44,923 --> 01:22:48,551
Peter, you have to tell me
what's going on. Just lay it out.

1291
01:22:48,718 --> 01:22:49,761
It's just me and you.

1292
01:22:51,638 --> 01:22:53,264
I lost the Stark internship.

1293
01:22:53,848 --> 01:22:55,433
- What?
- Yeah.

1294
01:22:55,892 --> 01:22:57,018
What happened?

1295
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:01,648
I just thought that I could work really
hard and he could... He would... You know.

1296
01:23:02,982 --> 01:23:04,943
But I screwed it up.

1297
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:06,903
It's okay, it's okay.

1298
01:23:08,613 --> 01:23:10,240
It's okay.

1299
01:23:11,116 --> 01:23:13,535
I'm sorry I made you worry.

1300
01:23:13,702 --> 01:23:15,537
I'm not trying to ruin your life.

1301
01:23:15,704 --> 01:23:16,996
Yeah, I know.

1302
01:23:17,163 --> 01:23:18,456
Just...

1303
01:23:18,623 --> 01:23:21,001
- I used to sneak out too.
- Yeah.

1304
01:23:24,004 --> 01:23:26,172
And take a shower. You smell.

1305
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:29,217
You smell like garbage.

1306
01:23:29,384 --> 01:23:31,011
I know.

1307
01:23:34,055 --> 01:23:36,391
Peter, you're a good kid
and you're a smart kid...

1308
01:23:36,558 --> 01:23:39,185
...so just try to keep
your head straight, okay?

1309
01:23:39,811 --> 01:23:41,271
Okay.

1310
01:23:41,438 --> 01:23:43,273
All right, get out of here.

1311
01:23:51,156 --> 01:23:52,282
Are you expelled?

1312
01:23:52,449 --> 01:23:55,452
Do you have to go to that high school
where the principal has a crossbow?

1313
01:23:55,618 --> 01:23:58,955
Pretty sure that's an urban myth,
and, no, I'm not expelled.

1314
01:23:59,497 --> 01:24:01,791
You're so lucky.

1315
01:24:49,923 --> 01:24:51,299
Hey.

1316
01:24:51,466 --> 01:24:54,594
- Hey.
- I thought you had calculus fifth period.

1317
01:24:54,761 --> 01:24:57,138
Yeah, I was just doing
some homecoming stuff.

1318
01:24:57,305 --> 01:24:59,015
Hey, look, I...

1319
01:24:59,891 --> 01:25:02,602
I just wanted to apologize
about the whole decathlon thing.

1320
01:25:02,769 --> 01:25:03,853
It's fine.

1321
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:08,066
Last week, decathlon was the most
important thing, but then I almost died.

1322
01:25:08,233 --> 01:25:10,151
No, I'm...

1323
01:25:10,318 --> 01:25:12,320
I just mean that...

1324
01:25:12,821 --> 01:25:15,365
...it was not cool, especially...

1325
01:25:17,117 --> 01:25:18,868
...because...

1326
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:22,706
...I like you.

1327
01:25:23,206 --> 01:25:24,708
I know.

1328
01:25:27,335 --> 01:25:28,378
You do?

1329
01:25:29,045 --> 01:25:31,172
You're terrible at keeping secrets.

1330
01:25:31,339 --> 01:25:33,008
Yeah, you'd be surprised.

1331
01:25:36,386 --> 01:25:38,680
I got to get to class, but...

1332
01:25:39,097 --> 01:25:43,268
I'd say we should hang out,
but I'm gonna be in detention...

1333
01:25:43,435 --> 01:25:46,438
...forever, but...

1334
01:25:46,604 --> 01:25:48,940
I guess you already have a date
to homecoming.

1335
01:25:49,107 --> 01:25:53,820
Actually, I was so busy planning it,
I never really got around to that part, so...

1336
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:56,740
Do you want to...

1337
01:25:56,906 --> 01:25:57,949
...go with me?

1338
01:25:58,908 --> 01:26:00,744
Yeah. Sure.

1339
01:26:00,910 --> 01:26:03,538
Really? I mean, great. Cool.

1340
01:26:03,913 --> 01:26:05,331
Cool.

1341
01:26:05,832 --> 01:26:08,418
I'm actually going that way.

1342
01:26:20,263 --> 01:26:21,473
May, I need your help.

1343
01:26:37,906 --> 01:26:39,741
Through or around?

1344
01:26:44,746 --> 01:26:45,997
Right?

1345
01:26:56,341 --> 01:26:58,593
It's game day. So, what's the plan?

1346
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,303
Open the door for her.

1347
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:02,990
Tell her she looks nice,
but not too much because that's creepy.

1348
01:27:03,056 --> 01:27:04,140
- Don't be creepy.
- No.

1349
01:27:04,307 --> 01:27:06,976
When I dance with her,
I'm putting my hands on her hips.

1350
01:27:07,143 --> 01:27:08,895
I got this.

1351
01:27:11,314 --> 01:27:12,357
- Love you.
- Bye.

1352
01:27:27,247 --> 01:27:28,873
You must be Peter.

1353
01:27:29,708 --> 01:27:30,834
Yeah.

1354
01:27:31,001 --> 01:27:32,544
I'm Liz's dad.

1355
01:27:32,711 --> 01:27:34,212
Put her there.

1356
01:27:34,796 --> 01:27:36,339
Hell of a grip.

1357
01:27:36,506 --> 01:27:38,800
Come on in here. Come on.

1358
01:28:02,323 --> 01:28:03,575
Hi, Peter.

1359
01:28:04,242 --> 01:28:05,827
You look very handsome.

1360
01:28:05,994 --> 01:28:07,495
Thank you.

1361
01:28:07,662 --> 01:28:09,789
You got his name right?

1362
01:28:09,956 --> 01:28:11,332
- Freddie?
- Peter.

1363
01:28:11,499 --> 01:28:12,709
Peter. Peter.

1364
01:28:13,710 --> 01:28:14,836
I'm gonna go get Liz.

1365
01:28:15,253 --> 01:28:16,796
Okay.

1366
01:28:22,761 --> 01:28:23,970
You all right, Pete?

1367
01:28:24,137 --> 01:28:25,263
Yeah.

1368
01:28:25,638 --> 01:28:28,016
Because you look pale.

1369
01:28:29,851 --> 01:28:31,311
You want something to drink?

1370
01:28:31,478 --> 01:28:33,730
A bourbon or a Scotch,
or something like that?

1371
01:28:33,897 --> 01:28:35,190
I'm not old enough to drink.

1372
01:28:35,732 --> 01:28:37,150
That's the right answer.

1373
01:28:41,613 --> 01:28:44,366
- Do you look beautiful.
- Please don't embarrass me, Dad.

1374
01:28:44,532 --> 01:28:45,950
Doesn't she, Pete?

1375
01:28:46,117 --> 01:28:48,495
Yeah, you look really good.

1376
01:28:48,661 --> 01:28:50,872
Once again, that's the right answer.

1377
01:28:51,039 --> 01:28:53,083
Is that a corsage?

1378
01:28:54,834 --> 01:28:56,336
Thanks.

1379
01:28:56,503 --> 01:28:59,714
Well, hey, I'm your chauffeur,
so let's get this show on the road.

1380
01:28:59,881 --> 01:29:03,051
No, no, no, we have to take
some pictures, babe. All right.

1381
01:29:03,218 --> 01:29:05,470
- Oh, right here. Perfect.
- Mom.

1382
01:29:05,637 --> 01:29:07,097
Okay. Come on, you guys.

1383
01:29:07,847 --> 01:29:09,933
Peter, closer.

1384
01:29:11,184 --> 01:29:12,560
Smile.

1385
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:15,313
There you go.

1386
01:29:21,111 --> 01:29:24,280
- Sir, you don't have to drive us.
- No, no, it's not a big deal.

1387
01:29:24,447 --> 01:29:26,658
I'm going out of town.
It's right on my way.

1388
01:29:26,825 --> 01:29:28,743
- He's always going. Have fun.
- Last time.

1389
01:29:28,910 --> 01:29:30,286
- Thank you.
- Promise.

1390
01:29:30,453 --> 01:29:31,871
He's cute.

1391
01:29:33,957 --> 01:29:36,543
- See you in a couple of days. All right.
- Bye, baby.

1392
01:29:36,710 --> 01:29:38,294
Come on, Pedro.

1393
01:29:38,461 --> 01:29:40,380
- Bye, Peter. Have fun.
- Yeah, I will.

1394
01:29:50,724 --> 01:29:53,351
- What are you gonna do, Pete?
- What?

1395
01:29:53,810 --> 01:29:55,650
When you graduate,
what do you think you'll do?

1396
01:29:55,729 --> 01:29:58,314
- Oh, I don't know.
- Don't grill him, Dad.

1397
01:29:59,065 --> 01:30:01,067
Just saying, you know.

1398
01:30:01,234 --> 01:30:02,986
All you guys who go to that school...

1399
01:30:03,153 --> 01:30:05,572
...you pretty much have
your life planned out, right?

1400
01:30:06,114 --> 01:30:08,283
Yeah, no, I'm just a sophomore.

1401
01:30:08,450 --> 01:30:11,870
Peter has an internship with Tony Stark.
I think he doesn't have to worry.

1402
01:30:12,579 --> 01:30:14,330
Really? Stark?

1403
01:30:14,497 --> 01:30:16,207
So cool.

1404
01:30:17,250 --> 01:30:18,418
What do you do?

1405
01:30:19,336 --> 01:30:21,796
Yeah, actually,
I don't intern for him anymore.

1406
01:30:21,963 --> 01:30:24,966
- Seriously?
- Yeah, it got...

1407
01:30:25,133 --> 01:30:26,176
...boring.

1408
01:30:26,343 --> 01:30:29,304
It was boring?
You got to hang out with Spider-Man.

1409
01:30:29,471 --> 01:30:31,389
Really? Spider-Man?

1410
01:30:33,016 --> 01:30:34,434
What's he like?

1411
01:30:35,518 --> 01:30:37,062
Yeah, he's nice.

1412
01:30:37,228 --> 01:30:39,064
Nice man.

1413
01:30:39,230 --> 01:30:41,066
Solid dude.

1414
01:30:43,985 --> 01:30:46,071
Look. So cute.

1415
01:30:51,451 --> 01:30:53,661
I've seen you around, right? I mean...

1416
01:30:54,412 --> 01:30:57,540
...somewhere. We've... Have we ever...?
Because even the voice...

1417
01:30:58,333 --> 01:31:00,043
He does Academic Decathlon with me.

1418
01:31:01,044 --> 01:31:02,629
And he was at my party.

1419
01:31:02,796 --> 01:31:05,173
It was a great party, really great, yeah.

1420
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:09,552
- Beautiful house, a lot of windows.
- You were there for, like, two seconds.

1421
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:13,473
That was... I was there longer
than two seconds.

1422
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:17,143
- You disappeared.
- No. No, I did not disappear.

1423
01:31:17,310 --> 01:31:21,481
Yes, you did. You disappeared like
you always do, like you did in D.C. too.

1424
01:31:29,072 --> 01:31:32,409
That's terrible what happened
down there in D.C. though.

1425
01:31:32,575 --> 01:31:34,202
Were you scared?

1426
01:31:35,036 --> 01:31:37,539
I'll bet you were glad
when your old pal Spider-Man...

1427
01:31:37,706 --> 01:31:39,791
...showed up in the elevator though, huh?

1428
01:31:42,585 --> 01:31:44,295
Yeah, well, I actually didn't go up.

1429
01:31:44,462 --> 01:31:46,214
I saw it all from the ground.

1430
01:31:47,215 --> 01:31:48,550
Yeah.

1431
01:31:48,883 --> 01:31:51,219
Very lucky that he was there that day.

1432
01:31:54,264 --> 01:31:56,933
Good old Spider-Man.

1433
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:02,439
Dad, the light.

1434
01:32:17,829 --> 01:32:20,040
Here we are. End of the line.

1435
01:32:20,206 --> 01:32:21,624
Thanks, Dad.

1436
01:32:22,083 --> 01:32:23,626
You head in there, gumdrop.

1437
01:32:23,793 --> 01:32:26,546
I'm gonna give Peter the "dad" talk.

1438
01:32:28,423 --> 01:32:30,383
Don't let him intimidate you.

1439
01:32:30,550 --> 01:32:31,760
Love you.

1440
01:32:31,926 --> 01:32:34,387
- Love you, gumdrop.
- Have a safe flight.

1441
01:32:34,554 --> 01:32:35,764
Hi.

1442
01:32:36,806 --> 01:32:39,100
You guys look so pretty.

1443
01:32:43,938 --> 01:32:44,981
Does she know?

1444
01:32:46,024 --> 01:32:47,317
Know what?

1445
01:32:47,484 --> 01:32:49,235
So she doesn't. Good.

1446
01:32:49,402 --> 01:32:51,071
Close to the vest.

1447
01:32:51,237 --> 01:32:52,405
I admire that.

1448
01:32:52,572 --> 01:32:54,699
I've got a few secrets of my own.

1449
01:32:55,325 --> 01:32:59,162
Of all the reasons
I didn't want my daughter to date....

1450
01:33:01,331 --> 01:33:02,749
Peter...

1451
01:33:02,916 --> 01:33:05,126
...nothing is more important than family.

1452
01:33:05,293 --> 01:33:07,087
You saved my daughter's life.

1453
01:33:07,253 --> 01:33:09,089
I could never forget something like that.

1454
01:33:09,255 --> 01:33:11,007
So I'm gonna give you one chance.

1455
01:33:11,174 --> 01:33:12,300
Are you ready?

1456
01:33:13,009 --> 01:33:16,012
You walk through those doors,
you forget any of this happened...

1457
01:33:16,429 --> 01:33:19,808
...and don't you ever, ever...

1458
01:33:19,974 --> 01:33:22,560
...interfere with my business again.

1459
01:33:22,727 --> 01:33:24,646
Because if you do...

1460
01:33:24,813 --> 01:33:27,065
...I'll kill you...

1461
01:33:27,232 --> 01:33:28,817
...and everybody you love.

1462
01:33:30,068 --> 01:33:31,903
I'll kill you dead.

1463
01:33:32,070 --> 01:33:34,864
That's what I'll do to protect my family.
Do you understand?

1464
01:33:36,783 --> 01:33:38,201
Hey.

1465
01:33:39,536 --> 01:33:42,956
I just saved your life.
Now what do you say?

1466
01:33:45,166 --> 01:33:46,501
Thank you.

1467
01:33:46,668 --> 01:33:48,420
You're welcome.

1468
01:33:48,586 --> 01:33:54,134
Now you go on in there and you show
my daughter a good time, okay?

1469
01:33:54,884 --> 01:33:56,761
Just not too good.

1470
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:51,483
Hey.

1471
01:34:53,943 --> 01:34:55,362
What did he say to you?

1472
01:34:59,616 --> 01:35:01,034
Gotta go.

1473
01:35:02,952 --> 01:35:04,579
I'm sorry.

1474
01:35:04,954 --> 01:35:06,873
You don't deserve this.

1475
01:35:28,311 --> 01:35:29,646
He gave you a choice.

1476
01:35:29,813 --> 01:35:31,898
- You chose wrong.
- What the hell?

1477
01:35:32,065 --> 01:35:33,733
What's with the crappy costume?

1478
01:35:36,152 --> 01:35:37,362
My web-shooters.

1479
01:35:46,287 --> 01:35:50,875
I wasn't sure about this thing at first,
but damn.

1480
01:35:56,047 --> 01:35:57,424
Gross.

1481
01:36:09,352 --> 01:36:11,855
- Why did he send you here?
- Guess you'll never know.

1482
01:36:16,943 --> 01:36:18,194
Nice shot!

1483
01:36:23,533 --> 01:36:24,659
Yes!

1484
01:36:24,826 --> 01:36:26,661
Ned, the guy with the wings is Liz's dad.

1485
01:36:26,828 --> 01:36:28,705
- What?
- I gotta tell Mr. Stark.

1486
01:36:28,872 --> 01:36:31,708
Call Happy Hogan.
He's Mr. Stark's head of security.

1487
01:36:31,875 --> 01:36:33,235
Get a computer and track my phone.

1488
01:36:33,501 --> 01:36:35,396
- Will you be okay?
- Hurry, we gotta catch him...

1489
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:37,714
...before he leaves town.

1490
01:36:37,881 --> 01:36:40,091
I'm sorry about dinner...

1491
01:36:40,508 --> 01:36:43,803
...but I know when branzino's fresh,
and that was not fresh, okay? So...

1492
01:36:45,263 --> 01:36:46,848
Flash, I need your car and phone.

1493
01:36:47,015 --> 01:36:49,768
Sir, technically,
this is my dad's car, sir. So I can't...

1494
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:00,278
Hello, Ned? Hey, hey, can you hear me?

1495
01:37:00,445 --> 01:37:02,447
- Go for Ned.
<i>- Ned, I need you...</i>

1496
01:37:02,781 --> 01:37:04,949
- ...to track my phone.
- Yeah, but where is it?

1497
01:37:09,913 --> 01:37:12,433
Genius move. Okay, he just passed
the GameStop on Jackson Avenue.

1498
01:37:12,457 --> 01:37:15,669
Hey, where are the headlights
on this thing? I'm in Flash's car.

1499
01:37:15,835 --> 01:37:18,171
- I'll pull the specs.
- Okay, you're on speakerphone.

1500
01:37:18,338 --> 01:37:21,299
- You stole Flash's car. Awesome.
- Yeah, it's awesome. It's...

1501
01:37:22,801 --> 01:37:24,844
Get out of the way,
get out of the way! Move!

1502
01:37:25,011 --> 01:37:26,771
- Are you okay?
- <i>I've never driven before...</i>

1503
01:37:26,805 --> 01:37:30,475
...only with May in parking lots.
This is a huge step up.

1504
01:37:32,477 --> 01:37:34,038
<i>Hey, have you gotten through
to Happy yet?</i>

1505
01:37:34,062 --> 01:37:37,399
Yeah. I'm working on it.
I just gotta backdoor the phone system.

1506
01:37:40,819 --> 01:37:42,529
Guy in the chair.

1507
01:37:47,617 --> 01:37:49,035
<i>Takeoff in nine minutes.</i>

1508
01:37:49,202 --> 01:37:51,371
<i>Hello? Hello? Who is this?</i>

1509
01:37:51,538 --> 01:37:52,658
- Mr. Happy, it's Ned.
<i>- Who?</i>

1510
01:37:52,747 --> 01:37:55,184
I'm an associate of Peter Parker.
Got something very important to tell you...

1511
01:37:55,208 --> 01:37:56,751
<i>You gotta be shitting me.</i>

1512
01:37:57,460 --> 01:37:58,503
Damn.

1513
01:37:58,670 --> 01:38:01,047
Hey, Ned, how we coming on
with those headlights?

1514
01:38:02,632 --> 01:38:05,468
Round knob to the left
of the steering wheel, turn clockwise.

1515
01:38:05,635 --> 01:38:06,928
Left, okay.

1516
01:38:07,095 --> 01:38:08,888
Okay, perfect.
So where's my phone now?

1517
01:38:10,473 --> 01:38:12,201
He stopped in an old industrial park
in Brooklyn.

1518
01:38:12,225 --> 01:38:15,020
What? That makes no sense.
He said he was going out of town.

1519
01:38:15,186 --> 01:38:18,606
Weird. Oh, I reached Mr. Happy.
Don't think he likes you, by the way.

1520
01:38:18,773 --> 01:38:20,442
It sounded like he was catching a flight.

1521
01:38:20,608 --> 01:38:21,877
<i>He said something about taking off
in nine minutes.</i>

1522
01:38:21,901 --> 01:38:23,903
- What?
- He was surrounded by boxes.

1523
01:38:24,070 --> 01:38:25,613
Boxes? It's moving day.

1524
01:38:25,780 --> 01:38:27,741
It's moving day.
He's gonna rob that plane.

1525
01:38:27,907 --> 01:38:29,784
I gotta stop him!

1526
01:38:32,954 --> 01:38:34,748
All right, wheels up in eight minutes.

1527
01:38:34,914 --> 01:38:37,500
We just got to load
Tony's old Hulkbuster Armor...

1528
01:38:37,667 --> 01:38:41,087
...prototype for Cap's new shield,
and the Meging...

1529
01:38:41,254 --> 01:38:42,797
The Meg... The...

1530
01:38:42,964 --> 01:38:44,132
Thor's magic belt.

1531
01:38:45,467 --> 01:38:48,136
Okay, slow down.
You're getting close. It's on your right.

1532
01:38:48,303 --> 01:38:49,554
- What?
<i>- Turn right.</i>

1533
01:38:59,397 --> 01:39:01,691
- Peter. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1534
01:39:01,858 --> 01:39:04,277
Just keep trying to get through to Happy.

1535
01:39:04,736 --> 01:39:06,905
It's been an honor, Spider-Man.

1536
01:39:07,572 --> 01:39:09,783
What are you doing here?
There's a dance.

1537
01:39:13,578 --> 01:39:14,621
I'm...

1538
01:39:14,788 --> 01:39:16,081
...looking...

1539
01:39:16,247 --> 01:39:18,416
...at porn.

1540
01:39:56,705 --> 01:39:57,747
Hey!

1541
01:39:59,290 --> 01:40:00,667
Surprised?

1542
01:40:00,834 --> 01:40:02,711
Oh, hey, Pete.

1543
01:40:03,420 --> 01:40:04,713
I didn't hear you come in.

1544
01:40:04,879 --> 01:40:06,965
It's over. I've got you.

1545
01:40:07,132 --> 01:40:09,134
You know, I gotta tell you, Pete...

1546
01:40:09,718 --> 01:40:12,637
...I really, really admire your grit.

1547
01:40:14,222 --> 01:40:15,390
I see why Liz likes you.

1548
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:19,519
I do. When you first came to the house...

1549
01:40:19,686 --> 01:40:22,814
...I wasn't sure.
I thought, "Really?" But I get it now.

1550
01:40:23,648 --> 01:40:25,400
How could you do this to her?

1551
01:40:25,567 --> 01:40:27,569
To her?
I'm not doing anything to her, Pete.

1552
01:40:27,736 --> 01:40:30,071
I'm doing this for her.

1553
01:40:30,572 --> 01:40:31,614
Yeah.

1554
01:40:35,660 --> 01:40:37,120
Peter...

1555
01:40:37,996 --> 01:40:39,039
...you're young.

1556
01:40:39,205 --> 01:40:41,458
You don't understand
how the world works.

1557
01:40:41,624 --> 01:40:44,377
But I understand that selling weapons
to criminals is wrong.

1558
01:40:44,544 --> 01:40:47,297
How do you think
your buddy Stark paid for that tower?

1559
01:40:47,464 --> 01:40:48,923
Or any of his little toys?

1560
01:40:49,090 --> 01:40:50,842
Those people, Pete,
those people up there...

1561
01:40:51,009 --> 01:40:53,303
...the rich and the powerful,
they do whatever they want.

1562
01:40:53,470 --> 01:40:55,221
Guys like us...

1563
01:40:55,388 --> 01:40:57,265
...like you and me...

1564
01:40:57,432 --> 01:40:58,892
...they don't care about us.

1565
01:40:59,059 --> 01:41:01,519
We build their roads,
and we fight all their wars...

1566
01:41:01,686 --> 01:41:03,980
...and everything,
but they don't care about us.

1567
01:41:04,147 --> 01:41:08,318
We have to pick up after them.
We have to eat their table scraps.

1568
01:41:09,569 --> 01:41:11,571
That's how it is.

1569
01:41:11,946 --> 01:41:14,032
I know you know
what I'm talking about, Peter.

1570
01:41:14,199 --> 01:41:15,950
Why are you telling me this?

1571
01:41:16,117 --> 01:41:18,578
Because I want you to understand.

1572
01:41:18,745 --> 01:41:20,163
And...

1573
01:41:20,330 --> 01:41:23,333
...I needed a little time
to get her airborne.

1574
01:41:36,304 --> 01:41:37,347
I'm sorry, Peter.

1575
01:41:40,684 --> 01:41:44,479
What are you talking about?
That thing hasn't even touched me yet.

1576
01:41:44,938 --> 01:41:47,190
True. Then again...

1577
01:41:47,357 --> 01:41:49,067
...wasn't really trying to.

1578
01:41:54,823 --> 01:41:56,449
<i>Chief, they're powering up engines.</i>

1579
01:41:56,616 --> 01:41:59,452
- Okay. Yeah, yeah.
<i>- Come on, come on, come on.</i>

1580
01:42:50,920 --> 01:42:52,714
Okay, ready?

1581
01:43:01,639 --> 01:43:03,600
Hello?

1582
01:43:05,977 --> 01:43:07,437
Hello!

1583
01:43:07,604 --> 01:43:09,189
Please, hey.

1584
01:43:09,606 --> 01:43:11,900
Hey, please. I'm down here.

1585
01:43:12,067 --> 01:43:14,027
I'm down here. I'm stuck.

1586
01:43:14,194 --> 01:43:16,988
I'm stuck. I can't move. I can't...

1587
01:43:33,755 --> 01:43:37,842
<i>If you're nothing without this suit,
then you shouldn't have it.</i>

1588
01:43:43,598 --> 01:43:45,558
Come on, Peter.

1589
01:43:45,725 --> 01:43:47,268
Come on, Spider-Man.

1590
01:43:47,435 --> 01:43:49,396
Come on, Spider-Man.

1591
01:43:49,562 --> 01:43:51,773
Come on, Spider-Man.

1592
01:43:53,650 --> 01:43:56,027
Come on, Spider-Man!

1593
01:44:47,203 --> 01:44:49,043
Launch for intercept.
Green light. Green light.

1594
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:50,749
Oh, yeah.

1595
01:45:05,638 --> 01:45:07,932
Retroreflective panels engaged.

1596
01:45:19,944 --> 01:45:22,864
Got a visual on the plane,
but I'm feeling a little resistance.

1597
01:45:23,031 --> 01:45:25,700
<i>It's probably just drag
on the new turbines.</i>

1598
01:45:38,421 --> 01:45:41,591
<i>Look out for the cloaking cameras.
Stay in the blind spots.</i>

1599
01:45:51,101 --> 01:45:52,852
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1600
01:45:53,186 --> 01:45:55,605
Deploying high-altitude vacuum seal.

1601
01:45:55,772 --> 01:45:57,023
This better work, Mason.

1602
01:46:02,862 --> 01:46:05,907
<i>Trust me, boss, even one of those boxes
and we are set for life.</i>

1603
01:46:06,074 --> 01:46:07,367
Yeah.

1604
01:46:19,796 --> 01:46:21,399
<i>You have 30 seconds
to get to the cockpit...</i>

1605
01:46:21,423 --> 01:46:23,216
<i>...and override their security.</i>

1606
01:46:34,769 --> 01:46:36,312
Cloning transponder signal.

1607
01:46:36,479 --> 01:46:38,148
Launching decoy drone.

1608
01:46:42,277 --> 01:46:44,404
Entering new coordinates.

1609
01:46:50,410 --> 01:46:51,578
Good, so it's on its way.

1610
01:46:51,745 --> 01:46:54,581
- Yes, sir, right on course.
- Okay, thank you.

1611
01:46:55,415 --> 01:46:56,833
All right.

1612
01:47:09,346 --> 01:47:10,972
Hot dog.

1613
01:48:00,605 --> 01:48:02,440
Just a typical homecoming...

1614
01:48:02,607 --> 01:48:05,318
...on the outside of an invisible jet...

1615
01:48:06,027 --> 01:48:07,737
...fighting my girlfriend's dad.

1616
01:48:17,288 --> 01:48:18,373
Oh, God!

1617
01:48:25,964 --> 01:48:28,049
I can't believe that worked.

1618
01:49:04,544 --> 01:49:06,796
Chief, they're losing altitude.
Get out of there.

1619
01:49:06,963 --> 01:49:08,243
I'm not going home empty-handed.

1620
01:49:18,391 --> 01:49:20,185
Oh, my God.

1621
01:49:34,699 --> 01:49:37,535
<i>- Get out of there. What are you doing?
</i>-Please turn, please turn!

1622
01:51:12,505 --> 01:51:14,215
Hey, Pedro.

1623
01:52:01,638 --> 01:52:02,681
Bingo.

1624
01:52:18,863 --> 01:52:20,657
Your wingsuit.

1625
01:52:20,824 --> 01:52:22,909
Your wingsuit's going to explode!

1626
01:52:30,291 --> 01:52:31,751
Time to go home, Pete.

1627
01:52:31,918 --> 01:52:33,378
I'm trying to save you!

1628
01:52:48,601 --> 01:52:49,978
No.

1629
01:52:50,645 --> 01:52:52,188
No.

1630
01:54:31,746 --> 01:54:33,665
It looked so insane. That whole...

1631
01:54:33,832 --> 01:54:35,166
Like, it was just crazy.

1632
01:54:35,333 --> 01:54:37,711
He... He was just, like....

1633
01:54:37,877 --> 01:54:39,879
And you were like....

1634
01:54:40,046 --> 01:54:41,923
And then I just hit him with the....

1635
01:54:42,090 --> 01:54:43,967
It was so... Oh, my God.

1636
01:54:44,134 --> 01:54:46,136
I mean, you saved me.

1637
01:54:46,469 --> 01:54:48,096
It was awesome.

1638
01:54:54,060 --> 01:54:55,812
Hey, Liz.

1639
01:54:57,313 --> 01:54:58,481
I'm gonna miss you.

1640
01:54:58,982 --> 01:55:00,567
Bye.

1641
01:55:01,192 --> 01:55:02,652
Liz.

1642
01:55:09,492 --> 01:55:10,702
Liz, look, I'm so sorry.

1643
01:55:11,745 --> 01:55:14,748
You say that a lot.
What are you sorry for this time?

1644
01:55:16,166 --> 01:55:17,208
The dance?

1645
01:55:18,543 --> 01:55:21,296
That was a pretty crappy thing to do.

1646
01:55:21,713 --> 01:55:22,797
Well, yeah, but I...

1647
01:55:22,964 --> 01:55:25,800
I mean, your dad... I can't imagine
what you're going through.

1648
01:55:25,967 --> 01:55:28,136
If there's anything I can do to help....

1649
01:55:28,303 --> 01:55:30,805
I guess we're moving to Oregon.

1650
01:55:30,972 --> 01:55:34,225
Mom says it's nice there, so that's cool.

1651
01:55:35,060 --> 01:55:39,230
Anyways, Dad doesn't want us here
during the trial. So....

1652
01:55:40,648 --> 01:55:43,318
Liz, I... I...

1653
01:55:43,485 --> 01:55:45,153
Bye, Peter.

1654
01:55:46,029 --> 01:55:49,532
Whatever's going on with you,
I hope you figure it out.

1655
01:56:02,045 --> 01:56:05,590
Congratulations,
decathlon national champions.

1656
01:56:05,757 --> 01:56:07,509
Yeah!

1657
01:56:07,967 --> 01:56:10,387
I'll have to put this back
in the trophy case soon...

1658
01:56:10,553 --> 01:56:13,056
...but just for motivation right now
at this practice.

1659
01:56:13,223 --> 01:56:14,891
I'm ahead of the game,
but we will need...

1660
01:56:15,058 --> 01:56:16,601
...a new team captain next year.

1661
01:56:16,768 --> 01:56:19,437
So I am appointing Michelle.

1662
01:56:20,438 --> 01:56:22,107
Yeah!

1663
01:56:24,317 --> 01:56:25,527
Thank you.

1664
01:56:25,694 --> 01:56:27,153
My... My friends call me MJ.

1665
01:56:27,779 --> 01:56:29,823
I thought you didn't have any friends.

1666
01:56:29,989 --> 01:56:31,908
I didn't.

1667
01:56:36,788 --> 01:56:38,790
- I gotta go.
- Hey, where you going?

1668
01:56:41,501 --> 01:56:43,628
What are you hiding, Peter?

1669
01:56:45,922 --> 01:56:47,507
I'm just kidding. I don't care. Bye.

1670
01:56:47,674 --> 01:56:50,343
- All right, so we should run some drills.
- Yeah.

1671
01:56:58,768 --> 01:57:02,105
Hey, Happy. What...?
What are you doing here?

1672
01:57:03,064 --> 01:57:04,315
I really owe you one.

1673
01:57:06,401 --> 01:57:08,695
I don't know what I would do
without this job.

1674
01:57:08,862 --> 01:57:11,364
I mean, before I met Tony...

1675
01:57:40,477 --> 01:57:42,479
So how long you been here?

1676
01:57:42,645 --> 01:57:44,814
Long enough to be awkward.
Boss wants to see you.

1677
01:57:45,774 --> 01:57:48,651
- Is he here too?
- In the toilet? No, he's upstate.

1678
01:57:49,194 --> 01:57:50,695
Upstate... Like, upstate-upstate?

1679
01:57:50,862 --> 01:57:52,447
Yeah, let's go.

1680
01:57:53,823 --> 01:57:54,949
Take a look.

1681
01:57:55,116 --> 01:57:57,160
It's pretty impressive, huh?

1682
01:57:58,244 --> 01:58:00,997
They just finished remodeling
the whole thing.

1683
01:58:27,190 --> 01:58:30,276
- You don't see that every day.
- Oh, there they are.

1684
01:58:30,944 --> 01:58:32,570
How was the ride up?

1685
01:58:32,987 --> 01:58:35,615
- Good.
- Give me a minute with the kid.

1686
01:58:36,366 --> 01:58:38,201
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1687
01:58:38,618 --> 01:58:39,994
I gotta talk to the kid.

1688
01:58:40,578 --> 01:58:41,663
I'll be close behind.

1689
01:58:41,830 --> 01:58:45,583
How about a loose follow?
All right? Boundaries are good.

1690
01:58:50,588 --> 01:58:51,798
Sorry I took your suit.

1691
01:58:51,965 --> 01:58:54,467
You had it coming.
Actually, it turns out it was...

1692
01:58:54,634 --> 01:58:56,636
...the perfect tough-love moment
that you needed.

1693
01:58:56,803 --> 01:58:59,639
To urge you on, right?
Wouldn't you think? Don't you think?

1694
01:58:59,806 --> 01:59:01,599
- I guess.
- Let's just say it was.

1695
01:59:03,476 --> 01:59:06,688
- Mr. Stark, I really...
- You screwed the pooch hard, bigtime.

1696
01:59:07,313 --> 01:59:08,982
But then you did the right thing.

1697
01:59:09,149 --> 01:59:12,318
Took the dog to the free clinic,
you raised the hybrid puppies....

1698
01:59:12,485 --> 01:59:14,362
All right, not my best analogy.

1699
01:59:15,572 --> 01:59:17,490
I was wrong about you.

1700
01:59:18,033 --> 01:59:20,285
I think, with a little more mentoring...

1701
01:59:20,452 --> 01:59:22,912
...you could be a real asset to the team.

1702
01:59:24,706 --> 01:59:26,541
- To the...? To the team?
- Yeah. Anyway...

1703
01:59:26,708 --> 01:59:29,753
...there's about 50 reporters behind
that door. Real ones, not bloggers.

1704
01:59:30,253 --> 01:59:32,088
When you're ready...

1705
01:59:32,464 --> 01:59:34,174
...why don't you try that on?

1706
01:59:34,341 --> 01:59:38,261
And I'll introduce the world to the newest
official member of the Avengers:

1707
01:59:38,428 --> 01:59:40,096
Spider-Man.

1708
01:59:42,557 --> 01:59:44,142
I....

1709
01:59:45,810 --> 01:59:48,063
Yeah, give that a look.

1710
01:59:53,568 --> 01:59:55,880
After the press conference,
Happy will show you to your room...

1711
01:59:55,904 --> 01:59:56,988
...your new quarters.

1712
01:59:57,155 --> 01:59:59,407
Where's he between?
He's next to Vision?

1713
01:59:59,574 --> 02:00:01,826
- Yeah, Vision's not big on doors.
- It's fun.

1714
02:00:01,993 --> 02:00:03,328
Or walls.

1715
02:00:03,495 --> 02:00:05,372
You'll fit right in.

1716
02:00:11,795 --> 02:00:13,797
Thank you, Mr. Stark.

1717
02:00:14,255 --> 02:00:15,507
But I'm good.

1718
02:00:16,549 --> 02:00:19,052
You're good? Good...?
How are you good?

1719
02:00:19,219 --> 02:00:23,390
Well, I mean, I'd rather just stay
on the ground for a little while.

1720
02:00:23,556 --> 02:00:25,725
Friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.

1721
02:00:25,892 --> 02:00:27,972
Somebody's got to look out
for the little guy, right?

1722
02:00:28,311 --> 02:00:29,771
You're turning me down?

1723
02:00:29,938 --> 02:00:32,023
You better think about this.
Look at that.

1724
02:00:32,190 --> 02:00:33,441
Look at me.

1725
02:00:34,192 --> 02:00:35,276
Last chance. Yes or no?

1726
02:00:35,443 --> 02:00:36,736
- No.
- Okay.

1727
02:00:36,903 --> 02:00:40,407
It's kind of a Springsteen-y,
working-class hero vibe that I dig.

1728
02:00:40,573 --> 02:00:42,575
Happy will take you home.

1729
02:00:42,742 --> 02:00:44,244
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1730
02:00:44,411 --> 02:00:46,579
Mind waiting in the car?
I need a minute.

1731
02:00:48,123 --> 02:00:50,792
- Thank you, Mr. Stark.
- Yes, Mr. Parker, very well.

1732
02:00:50,959 --> 02:00:52,669
- See you around.
- Okay.

1733
02:01:00,885 --> 02:01:02,095
That was a test, right?

1734
02:01:02,887 --> 02:01:05,348
- There's nobody back there?
- Yes, you passed.

1735
02:01:06,224 --> 02:01:09,102
- All right, skedaddle there, young buck.
- Thank you, Mr. Stark.

1736
02:01:09,269 --> 02:01:10,979
Yeah, thank you.

1737
02:01:13,064 --> 02:01:14,941
Told you he's a good kid.

1738
02:01:21,197 --> 02:01:22,657
- Where's the kid?
- He left.

1739
02:01:22,824 --> 02:01:25,744
- Everybody's waiting.
- He actually made a mature choice.

1740
02:01:25,910 --> 02:01:28,913
- It just surprised the heck out of us.
- Did you screw this up?

1741
02:01:29,080 --> 02:01:31,308
- He told the kid to go wait in the car.
- Are you kidding?

1742
02:01:31,332 --> 02:01:33,501
I have a room full of people
in there waiting...

1743
02:01:33,668 --> 02:01:35,604
...for some big announcement.
What will I tell them?

1744
02:01:35,628 --> 02:01:38,131
Think of something. How about...?

1745
02:01:38,673 --> 02:01:40,842
- Hap, you still got that ring?
- Do I...? I...?

1746
02:01:41,009 --> 02:01:42,320
- The engagement ring.
- Are you kidding?

1747
02:01:42,344 --> 02:01:45,555
I've been carrying this since 2008.

1748
02:01:48,224 --> 02:01:49,351
Okay.

1749
02:01:49,517 --> 02:01:51,245
I think I can think
of something better than that.

1750
02:01:51,269 --> 02:01:53,646
Well, it would buy us a little time.

1751
02:01:54,939 --> 02:01:57,067
Like we need time.

1752
02:01:57,233 --> 02:01:58,993
I can't believe you have that
in your pocket.

1753
02:01:59,069 --> 02:02:01,571
- Want me to get the door for you, hon?
- I got it.

1754
02:02:17,754 --> 02:02:20,215
Aunt May, did you do dinner already?

1755
02:02:30,475 --> 02:02:32,143
May?

1756
02:02:53,915 --> 02:02:54,958
What the...?!

1757
02:05:09,050 --> 02:05:11,011
Look who it is.

1758
02:05:12,929 --> 02:05:16,099
What are the odds you and I'd end up
at the same summer camp?

1759
02:05:16,266 --> 02:05:17,559
Relax.

1760
02:05:18,184 --> 02:05:20,186
This? It's not on you.

1761
02:05:20,353 --> 02:05:23,440
It's on our little spider friend.

1762
02:05:23,606 --> 02:05:27,193
I've got some boys on the outside
who would love to meet him.

1763
02:05:27,360 --> 02:05:30,822
You know, take a picture,
slice his throat, put his head in a dryer.

1764
02:05:31,364 --> 02:05:33,616
And I heard a rumor.

1765
02:05:36,870 --> 02:05:38,455
You know who he is.

1766
02:05:42,208 --> 02:05:44,544
If I knew who he was...

1767
02:05:44,711 --> 02:05:46,296
...he'd already be dead.

1768
02:05:50,842 --> 02:05:53,720
Toomes, your family's here!

1769
02:12:32,827 --> 02:12:35,663
Hi, I'm Captain America,
here to talk to you...

1770
02:12:35,830 --> 02:12:39,793
...about one of the most valuable traits
a soldier or student can have.

1771
02:12:39,959 --> 02:12:41,628
Patience.

1772
02:12:41,795 --> 02:12:43,922
Sometimes patience is the key to victory.

1773
02:12:44,089 --> 02:12:46,132
Sometimes it leads to very little...

1774
02:12:46,299 --> 02:12:48,635
...and it seems like it's not worth it.

1775
02:12:48,802 --> 02:12:50,303
And you wonder...

1776
02:12:50,470 --> 02:12:54,307
...why you waited so long
for something so disappointing.

1777
02:12:58,019 --> 02:13:00,021
How many more of these?
