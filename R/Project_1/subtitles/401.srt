00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,360
Oh-ooh!

3
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,830
Stairs.

4
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,500
I don't think I can...

5
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,830
You guys,
just start without me.

6
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,610
I'll...
I'll catch up!

7
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,900
Sweet.

8
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,220
Ah.

9
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:22,450
Inner peace.

10
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,350
Itchy nose.

11
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,410
Ah-choo!

12
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,900
Finally, inner peace.

13
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,930
Now what?

14
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,320
Kai, old friend.

15
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,780
Master Oogway.

16
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,240
Our battle ended
500 years ago!

17
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,880
Well, now I'm ready
for a rematch.

18
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,320
Took you long enough!
Ha ha ha ha!

19
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,140
You've grown stronger.

20
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,110
500 years in the spirit realm,
you pick up a thing or two.

21
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:36,220
I have taken the chi
of every master here.

22
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,590
- Huh! No!
- Yes.

23
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,330
And soon I will have
your power, too.

24
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,270
When will you realize?

25
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,840
The more you take,
the less you have.

26
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,080
With your chi,

27
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:11,860
I will finally be able to
return to the mortal world.

28
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:16,340
And this time,
you won't be there to stop me.

29
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,760
It was never my destiny
to stop you.

30
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,630
I have set another
on that path.

31
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,340
Then I will find him...

32
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,340
And take his chi, too.

33
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:54,790
Ha!
Justice is about to be served!

34
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,080
KUNG FU PANDA 3

35
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,770
AAHHHH!

36
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,680
Whoo-hoo!

37
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,630
Yee-haw!

38
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,850
We'll have two justice
platters, please.

39
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:51,890
Um... three.
Three.

40
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,420
And a few tofu buns.

41
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,560
Oh, the spicy noodle soup
for Tigress.

42
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,690
Did you want
extra sauce with that?

43
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:56,760
She wants it
on the side.

44
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,230
- On the side.
- On the side.

45
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,430
- Go, dragon warrior!
- You can do it!

46
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,460
Go, dragon warrior!

47
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,770
Defend the valley!

48
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,930
Dragon warrior!

49
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,500
Go, dragon warrior!

50
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,840
Yeah!
Defend the valley!

51
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,000
Yee-haw!

52
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,090
You guys aren't doing
the dramatic pose, are you?

53
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,780
Do we have to strike a pose
every time we land?

54
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,680
You guys,
never underestimate

55
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,340
the power of a dramatic entrance.

56
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,790
I've heard about
some masters who can win a fight

57
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,920
just by throwing
open a door.

58
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,120
Shee-yah.
Oh!

59
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,630
Dramatic entrance?

60
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,830
Master Shifu.

61
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,830
The dragon warrior
is correct.

62
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,630
Really?
I was just making...

63
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,620
Uh, yeah.
I mean, yeah. I am.

64
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:41,840
Before the battle of the fist
comes the battle of the mind.

65
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,130
Hence,
the dramatic entrance.

66
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,830
Oh!

67
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,890
Nice dramatic entrance.
What's the occasion?

68
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,690
Today will be
my final class.

69
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,660
Your final...?
Wait.

70
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,060
I didn't even know
you were sick!

71
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,200
- Although you have been looking a little...
- I'm not sick.

72
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,670
healthy.
A little healthy. A lot, actually.

73
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,040
My final class,
because from now on...

74
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,540
Your training will be
in the hands

75
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,640
of the dragon warrior.

76
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,320
What?

77
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,980
Me, teach?
I mean, why not Tigress?

78
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,300
She's always telling everyone
what to do.

79
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,680
- Be quiet, Po.
- You see what I mean?

80
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,550
Tigress is not the dragon warrior.

81
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,720
You are.

82
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,290
Come on,
they're the five.

83
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,100
What could I teach them?

84
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:40,340
There is always something more
to learn, even for a master.

85
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,700
For instance... Let me
show you another move.

86
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,230
The dramatic exit.

87
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,070
What's that?

88
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,940
Wow!
Are you kidding me?

89
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,010
Where'd he go?

90
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,850
- Master.
- Master.

91
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,950
He's gone, guys.
It's cool.

92
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,230
We await your instruction, master.

93
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,830
All you have to lose
is our respect.

94
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,190
I mean, seriously,
how bad can it be?

95
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,370
Very bad!
Very, very bad!

96
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,630
Okay, okay.
Let's switch it up.

97
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,260
Monkey!
Immovable mountain stance!

98
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,420
Yes, master!

99
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,120
I mean...
Tigress, tornado back flip!

100
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,010
Yes, master.

101
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,070
Oh, no!
Fire!

102
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,770
- Fire!
- Stop!

103
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,260
Sorry!
My fault.

104
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,070
Crane, go high.
I mean low! Low!

105
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,050
Ah, my claw thingy!

106
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,050
Uh, Viper and Tigress, do,

107
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,090
uh, like, a totem pole
poison technique!

108
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:42,320
Uh, you two,
do a swarming insect bite...

109
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,690
With a yellow tail,
yellow jacket, spicy tuna...

110
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,720
I'm sorry.

111
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,330
Good job, Po.

112
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,710
Ah!

113
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,810
Did you at least learn
a little something?

114
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,910
Yes.

115
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,980
That you can't teach.

116
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,190
And Tigress is flammable,
it turns out.

117
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,020
Yeah, that was
a complete disaster.

118
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,820
Uh, I'm glad
we're not Po right now.

119
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,060
What a loser!

120
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,730
What was Shifu thinking?

121
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:22,810
What was Oogway thinking?
Ah ha ha!

122
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,770
I think he heard us.

123
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,940
I didn't hear anything.

124
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,230
Uh, he said
you're a loser.

125
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,450
I'm sorry, Oogway.

126
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,380
Uh!
Ho-ho!

127
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,790
Would you stop doing that?

128
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,330
How was your
first day teaching?

129
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,660
Humiliating.

130
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,990
I heard.

131
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,590
Who told you?
Did Tigress tell you?

132
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,960
I heard from Monkey,
and Crane, and Mantis...

133
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,480
And your dad, and Mrs. chao
from the gift shop...

134
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,100
And those ducks
you just passed...

135
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,400
And... Tigress told me.

136
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,680
Yeah. Did she also tell you that
it'll never happen again?

137
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,810
- Because I'm done.
- Teaching or being humiliated?

138
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,180
Both! I don't know
why you ever thought

139
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,710
I could teach that class.

140
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,380
Oh, I knew you couldn't.

141
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,680
What? You set me up to fail?
Why?

142
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,540
If you only do
what you can do,

143
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,670
you will never be
more than you are now.

144
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,360
I don't wanna be more!
I like who I am.

145
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,160
You don't even know
who you are.

146
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,730
What do you...?
Of course I do.

147
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,830
I'm the dragon warrior.

148
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:34,570
And what exactly does
that mean, dragon warrior?

149
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,850
Hmm.

150
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:40,010
It means, you know,
just going around

151
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:41,780
and punching and kicking.

152
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,180
Defending the valley!
And stuff.

153
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,880
Punching and kicking?

154
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,180
You think that is what

155
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,540
the great master Oogway
saw for you?

156
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,290
A 500-year prophecy
fulfilled

157
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:56,030
so you could spend your days
kicking butt...

158
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,290
And running through town
high-fiving bunnies?

159
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,150
- Yes?
- No!

160
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,700
Oogway saw greatness
in you, Po.

161
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,930
Against my better judgment.

162
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,900
More than you can see
in yourself.

163
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,810
Incredible power awaits you.

164
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:18,180
Power beyond anything
you can imagine.

165
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,500
Wow!
What was that?

166
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,800
That was chi.

167
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,470
Wow!

168
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,940
What's chi?

169
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:44,840
The energy that flows
through all living things.

170
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,070
So you're saying if I...
So you're saying if I teach,

171
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,250
I'll be able to do
cool stuff like that?

172
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,410
No. I'm saying
if you teach,

173
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,580
I'll be able to do
cool stuff like that.

174
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,810
Oh.

175
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,080
Mastering chi requires
mastery of self.

176
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,190
Oogway sat alone
in a cave

177
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:03,060
for 30 years
asking one question.

178
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,020
"Who am I?"

179
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,840
"Who am I?"

180
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,790
I'm lucky
if I get five minutes

181
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,360
before you interrupt...

182
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,580
So now I have to sit alone
in a cave for 30 years?

183
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,830
Eventually.

184
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,680
After you master teaching.

185
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:19,070
Teaching? There's no way
I'm ever gonna be like you.

186
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,080
I'm not trying
to turn you into me.

187
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,680
I'm trying to turn you
into you.

188
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,150
Turn me... into me?

189
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,490
Wait a second,
that makes no...

190
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,970
Almost there, Shifu.

191
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:36,190
Just a little more confusing
and you'll be the next Oogway.

192
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,160
Hmm...
Oh! Uh...

193
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,640
Sorry, no offense,
master Oogway. I just...

194
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,960
I'll let you get back
to your eternal peace.

195
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,560
What is this place?

196
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,910
Uh... my brother's farm?

197
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,950
Ah.

198
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,530
If I stepped on you,
would you die?

199
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,190
Yes.

200
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,230
The mortal realm.

201
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:44,260
You hear that, Oogway?
I'm back.

202
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:48,060
Kai has returned!

203
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,010
- Who?
- Who?

204
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,170
Kai.
General Kai.

205
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:55,840
Supreme warlord
of all China.

206
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,170
Huh?

207
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:01,110
The Jade slayer.
Master of pain.

208
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,240
You may know me as
the beast of vengeance.

209
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,080
Uh... maker of widows?

210
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,640
Uh...

211
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,080
Okay, I used to
work with Oogway.

212
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,420
Oh, master Oogway!

213
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,920
Now, he was a great warrior.

214
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,190
We've heard
of master Oogway.

215
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,170
- Okay, okay, enough. Silence!
- Wise and...

216
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,870
Find Oogway's students,
and bring them to me.

217
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:37,150
By the time I am done
with them, Oogway...

218
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:41,630
There will be no one left
to will even remember your name.

219
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:46,430
Ha ha ha ha!
Kai is coming!

220
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,690
I am ready...

221
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,630
To teach you a lesson.

222
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:55,100
Teach me? Oh, no!
It's the dragon teacher!

223
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,560
Yeah, he's so handsome!

224
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,600
Thank you
for the compliment.

225
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,940
No! Please don't
teach me to death!

226
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,210
Po?

227
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,710
Oh, hey, dad.
What's up?

228
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,320
I was just, uh...
Stopping by for a little soak.

229
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,090
- Okay. What's wrong?
- Nothing.

230
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,570
Nothing?
I come home

231
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,730
to find you taking
a bath with your dolls...

232
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,960
Action figures.

233
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,930
and instead of adding
bath salts to the water,

234
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,760
you just added
szechuan peppercorns.

235
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,460
Szechuan what...

236
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:32,170
Oh, oh, my tenders!
Oh...

237
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,070
Okay, yes,
something's wrong.

238
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,370
There, there, son.

239
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,170
You tell your daddy
all about it.

240
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,540
Lift your arm.

241
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,310
Shifu says I don't know
what it means

242
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,140
to be the dragon warrior.

243
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,350
Now I have to
be a teacher?

244
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,150
I thought I finally
knew who I was.

245
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,350
If I'm not the dragon warrior,
then who am I?

246
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,490
A teacher?
Teaching kung fu?

247
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,900
Po, that's a promotion!

248
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,290
Take the job, son!

249
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,490
And, someday when
you're in charge

250
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,160
of the whole Jade palace...

251
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,560
I can sell noodles
in the lobby! Ho-ho!

252
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,450
Why are you still here
taking a bath like a baby?

253
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,700
Get out!
Get up!

254
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,960
Go, go, go!
Franchise expansion awaits us!

255
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,000
But what about the dragon warrior
look-alike contest?

256
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,240
Oh, Mrs. chow
always wins that.

257
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,700
Skadoosh.

258
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,180
And the dragon warrior
dumpling-eating contest?

259
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,640
I have to defend my title.

260
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,480
No one's gonna beat your
dumpling-eating record.

261
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:23,110
Someone's about to beat your
dumpling-eating record!

262
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,490
Go! Go!
Go!

263
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,850
- Who's eating my dumplings?
- And who's paying for them?

264
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:32,690
101!
102!

265
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,300
- Yay!
- Yay!

266
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,100
103...!

267
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,240
Yeah!

268
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,100
Is that a new record?

269
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,820
Who are you?

270
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,070
I am Li Shan.

271
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,990
What?

272
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,780
I'm Li Shan.

273
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,970
I'm looking for my son.

274
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,430
- Huh!
- Huh!

275
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,210
Huh!

276
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,200
You lost your son?

277
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,710
Yes.

278
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,400
Many years ago.

279
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,430
I lost my father.

280
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,370
I'm very sorry.

281
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,250
Thank you.

282
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,450
Well, good luck to you.

283
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,980
You, too.

284
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,140
I hope you find your son.

285
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,530
And I hope you find
your father.

286
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,540
- Son?
- Huh!

287
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,460
Oh, my gosh,
it is you!

288
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,370
Well, don't just stand there.
Give your old man a hug!

289
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,410
I can't believe
you're alive!

290
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,980
Oh, I thought I lost
you forever, little Lotus.

291
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,110
Uh...

292
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,740
Okay. Uh, this is
very embarrassing...

293
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,020
But I think you've
got me confused

294
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,180
with a panda
named Lotus.

295
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,650
My name is Po.

296
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,840
Oh, right,
you wouldn't know.

297
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,690
Oh. Okay.
See, little Lotus

298
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,990
was the name
you were given at birth.

299
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,630
- Really?
- Really! Ha!

300
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:17,660
I can't believe it! After all
these years, you're really here?

301
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,130
This is amazing!

302
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,530
Oh, Dad!

303
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,360
Come!
Say hi to, um...

304
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,140
I don't know-I don't know
what I'm supposed to call you.

305
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,140
I'm pretty sure
he said his name is Li.

306
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,810
You.

307
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,580
Come here.

308
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,780
Oh...

309
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,480
Thank you, thank you

310
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,980
for taking such good care
of my son.

311
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,180
Your son?
Now, hold on just a minute.

312
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,070
How do we know this stranger
is even related to you?

313
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,760
Look at that.

314
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,190
- Our bellies could be brothers!
- That is so cool.

315
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,230
Hey, son, let me teach you
how to belly gong.

316
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,960
- All right. Belly gong.
- They jiggle the same!

317
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,780
Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle.

318
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:55,340
It's like looking
in a fat mirror.

319
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,750
I can't believe we're taking
a picture together.

320
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,100
Huh?

321
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,490
But I still
don't understand.

322
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,910
I thought Po was
the only panda left.

323
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,580
No.
There's a whole bunch of us.

324
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,550
- Where?
- Here.

325
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,620
A secret panda village
in the mountains.

326
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,030
- A secret panda...
- Shhh, shhhh...

327
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,960
Whoa.

328
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,500
But how did you know
where I was?

329
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:22,490
I received a message
that led me here.

330
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,350
How could you receive
a message

331
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,730
if no one could find you?

332
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,420
Sounds suspicious to me.

333
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,300
Hmm?

334
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,040
No, it was a message
from the universe.

335
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,470
- Whoa!
- Whoa.

336
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:34,460
Rats!

337
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:37,720
Now, what's all
this about a dragon warrior?

338
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,740
How did you know
i was a dragon warrior?

339
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:42,020
Did the universe
tell you that, too?

340
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,120
No, the poster did.
And the gift shop.

341
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,850
I bought a tiny cup.

342
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,490
Oh, right, of course!

343
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:52,340
You have no idea.
There's so much to show you.

344
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:54,230
You're gonna be
so awesomely proud.

345
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,890
Come on, come on!

346
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,240
I'm already awesomely proud.

347
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,700
Oh.

348
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,040
- Couple more steps.
- Give me a minute.

349
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,910
Feeling the burn.

350
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,110
Do you have panda asthma, too?

351
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,700
Does that run
in the family?

352
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:14,580
Dad, you're gonna love this.

353
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,960
It's, like,
the coolest thing ever.

354
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:20,050
This is
the hall of heroes.

355
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:23,090
Home of the most priceless kung
fu artifacts in all of China!

356
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:26,160
Whoa!
This place is...

357
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,490
Awesome?
Were you gonna say...

358
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,530
You were gonna say "awesome,"
right? Because it totally is!

359
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:32,400
Totally! But be super careful.
Everything's very fragile here.

360
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,480
Like the urn
of whispering warriors.

361
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,140
Someone broke that once.

362
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,840
- Who?
- Some idiot.

363
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,570
Wow!

364
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,520
This is master Flying Rhino's
battle armor!

365
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:44,090
I wonder
if I could fit in that.

366
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,720
Get out of my head, Dad!
I've wondered the same thing!

367
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,980
If I could fit in it?

368
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,180
If you could?
No, if I could fit.

369
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,330
Oh.
Dad, check it out!

370
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:54,000
Master ram's crossbow,
the infamous gate smasher.

371
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,290
Dad, look at this!

372
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,890
The battle helmets
of master rat's army.

373
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,920
They're so tiny!

374
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,570
Master dolphin's
waterproof armor!

375
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,810
This is my favorite.

376
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,410
Check it out.
It's the legendary

377
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:05,570
battle rickshaw
of emperor hawk.

378
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,150
- Sweet ride.
- Ahh!

379
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,340
Dad, what are you doing?

380
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,670
We're not supposed
to touch anything!

381
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:14,400
Oh, sorry, sorry.
Should I put it back?

382
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,410
Yeah, you probably should.

383
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,480
You look so cool, though.

384
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,080
Hoo hoo hoo.
How does it feel?

385
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,620
Do the hinges hinge?
Does it smell like rhino?

386
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,480
Does it feel like
you're impenetrable?

387
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,500
Does it feel like you could
take on like a thousand warriors...

388
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,560
And rant...
And emerge unscathed?

389
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,590
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

390
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:33,660
Ooh!

391
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,090
I wonder what this does.
I should pull it.

392
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,620
I think I just
peed a little.

393
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,630
Anything else
we should try in here, son?

394
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,390
Hmm?

395
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:01,960
Charge!

396
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,860
Faster, faster, faster!

397
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,660
Thumb war!

398
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,200
- Reinforcements!
- Ooh. Ooh.

399
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,430
No fair.
No fair.

400
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,080
- Ha ha ha!
- Yeah!

401
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,770
This is so much fu...

402
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,170
Here we go!
Go, go, go!

403
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,390
Awesome!
Faster, faster, faster.

404
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:23,280
- There, there.
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

405
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,930
There you go.

406
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,050
Dolphin-style attack!

407
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:30,110
You got me.
Dolphin-style retreat!

408
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:33,180
Go long, son!

409
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,390
Whoa! I wasn't ready!

410
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,320
- Coming back at you.
- I got it.

411
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,990
- I'm going high!
- There you go.

412
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,930
Come on, throw it!

413
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,100
I'm coming for you.

414
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,700
Bring it on, master Rhino.

415
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,470
Here I come!

416
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,970
Oh!

417
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,150
I'm gonna get you.
I am gonna get you!

418
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,820
I'm gonna get you,
I'm gonna get you!

419
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,020
- Psst. Psst. Psst.
- I'm gonna get you.

420
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,320
Who's got you?
Who's gonna get you?

421
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,810
Who's gonna get you?
Yeah. Who's gonna get you?

422
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,090
Master Rhino.

423
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,700
What?
What's wrong?

424
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,930
Hello.

425
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,180
Guys, guys.

426
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,310
You're never gonna guess
who just showed up.

427
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,140
Not in a million years.

428
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,310
You just try.

429
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,610
- Your father!
- Your father!

430
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,620
Whoa!
How did you just guess that?

431
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:32,910
Oh, wait a second.
Oh, yeah, of course.

432
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:34,010
We look exactly the same.

433
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:35,790
Dad, say hi to my friends.

434
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:39,320
Mantis, Tigress,
Monkey, Crane, and Viper.

435
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,080
- Oh, Viper, was it?
- Monkey, sir.

436
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,600
They're kind of my best friends.
And this...

437
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:46,430
This is master Shifu.
Legend.

438
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:49,660
Uh... it is an honor
to meet you, master Panda.

439
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,400
Perhaps your father
would care to join us

440
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,000
in the training hall.

441
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,870
Your son will be
teaching the class.

442
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:55,980
- Uh!
- Uh!

443
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,600
- Oh, ho, ho!
- I'm sure he's tired.

444
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,160
I'm sure you're tired.
He's tired.

445
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,760
I'm gonna show him
to the chrysanthemum suite.

446
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,880
What, tired?
No, I'm fine.

447
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,580
I would love
to watch you teach.

448
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,820
Trust me, it'll be more fun
just to watch me...

449
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:08,590
- Fight!
- What-What is that?

450
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:10,650
The valley's under attack.

451
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,190
Son?
Under attack?

452
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,420
This is perfect!

453
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,310
Now you can see what being the
dragon warrior's all about!

454
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,230
Follow me!

455
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,170
Enemies of justice,
prepare for war!

456
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,440
Are you kidding me?
Whoa!

457
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,040
Ow!

458
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:42,130
What's the deal
with the green guys?

459
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,150
Some kind of Jade zombies.

460
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,850
Jade zombies?

461
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,120
- Jombies! Jinx!
- Jombies! Jinx!

462
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,390
Ow!

463
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:50,290
Lotus, be careful!

464
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:53,120
It's okay, dad,
I do this every day!

465
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,430
Whoa!
I recognize these guys.

466
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,940
The master Badger twins,

467
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,830
with their crushing
double-gong technique!

468
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,070
Ow!

469
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,070
Yeah, that's the one!

470
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:06,870
And that guy is... No!
Master porcupine!

471
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,440
I thought he died
a hundred years ago.

472
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,880
These guys are legend!

473
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,800
Get a quick sketch of us.

474
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:24,320
Did you get it?
Did you get it?

475
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,030
Oh, I blinked.

476
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,990
Can we get another one?
Ooo!

477
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,870
I'm being choked
by master porcupine.

478
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,530
This is so cool.

479
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,340
Oh! Oh, look.
It's you!

480
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,440
Po, focus!

481
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,990
"Message from the universe."

482
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,600
I'll give you a message
from the universe.

483
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:45,110
Stay away from my son!

484
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,610
Sorry, dad.
I'll clean up later.

485
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,210
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Not my good pan!

486
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,110
Uh, take this one.

487
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,140
Lotus!
Watch out!

488
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,320
- Whoa!
- Ah!

489
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,990
Dad, check out
my dumplings of doom.

490
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,160
Gotcha.

491
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,480
Eh ha ha ha...!

492
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,980
I see you.

493
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,540
<i>Your chi will soon be mine.</i>

494
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,810
- Is he talking to me?
- Which one?

495
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,910
They're all talking.

496
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,990
Whoa, you're right.
That's so scary.

497
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,260
We should try that, too.
Maybe it'd be scary back at them.

498
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,910
Okay, but we gotta plan
what we're gonna say first.

499
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,750
Otherwise, it won't be scary.
It'll just be stupid.

500
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,180
<i>It's not them talking,
you idiots!</i>

501
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,330
<i>It's me talking
through them. Kai!</i>

502
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,460
- Who?
- Who?

503
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,830
Okay, okay, okay.
Enough.

504
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:48,440
Did you see that?
What just happened?

505
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,510
The green smoke, just poof!
And then poof!

506
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,310
Shifu, what was that?

507
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:55,580
Kai... Kai... Kai...

508
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,520
Nope, never heard of him.

509
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,790
Kai... Kai...

510
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:00,900
Where is it?

511
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,380
There's so much wisdom in here,
I can't find anything.

512
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:05,230
Yes!

513
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,760
Behold.

514
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:11,360
All the answers
will be found within.

515
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:15,730
What?
It's blank?

516
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:19,280
Are you kidding me?
Not again.

517
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:22,280
Wait, wait, hold on.
Sorry.

518
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,280
Oh, okay.
Here we go.

519
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,080
It is written
in Oogway's hand.

520
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:30,420
"Long ago,
I had a brother..."

521
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,090
Oogway had a brother?

522
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,720
"In arms. In arms." Sorry.
He says, "brother-in-arms."

523
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,190
Maybe you should just
unroll it all at once?

524
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:43,760
"I was an ambitious young warrior
leading a great army."

525
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:48,740
<i>And fighting
by my side was Kai...</i>

526
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,670
<i>My closest friend.</i>

527
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:57,040
<i>One day,
we were ambushed.</i>

528
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,980
<i>I was badly wounded.</i>

529
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:03,830
<i>My friend carried me</i><i> for days,</i>
<i>looking for help...</i>

530
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:06,620
<i>Until we came
to a secret village...</i>

531
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,760
<i>High in the mountains.</i>

532
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,620
<i>An ancient place of healing.</i>

533
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,630
<i>A village of pandas.</i>

534
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,460
- Huh!
- Pandas?

535
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,810
<i>Yes, pandas.</i>

536
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:23,560
<i>Pandas who used</i><i> the power of chi</i>
<i>to heal me.</i>

537
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:29,670
<i>They taught me how to give chi.</i>

538
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:39,220
<i>Oh, but Kai wanted
the power all to himself.</i>

539
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:44,460
<i>He saw that what could be
given could also be taken.</i>

540
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:50,690
<i>I had to stop him.</i>

541
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:57,400
<i>Our battle shook the earth...</i>

542
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,510
<i>Until, finally...</i>

543
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:02,770
<i>I banished Kai
to the spirit realm.</i>

544
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,640
<i>Should he ever return
to the mortal realm...</i>

545
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:10,190
<i>He can only be stopped
by a true master of chi.</i>

546
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,930
"True master of chi"?

547
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,080
Like you!

548
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,190
Me? I can barely
make a flower bloom.

549
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,590
I need at least 30 more years,
and a cave.

550
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,830
We need a chi master.

551
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,320
He will continue stealing

552
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,010
the chi of masters
until he has consumed it all.

553
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,350
- We have to think of a way to stop him!
- He'll get more and more powerful

554
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,960
with every master he defeats.

555
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,570
- There is no choice.
- We fight.

556
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,540
I can teach you, son.

557
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,700
Huh!

558
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,210
You can do this?

559
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:37,440
Of course.
I'm a panda.

560
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,440
That must be why
the universe sent you here!

561
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,720
Okay, so what do I have to do?

562
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,650
You have to come home with me.

563
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,750
What?

564
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:48,250
- To the secret village?
- Yes, son.

565
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:52,300
You must rediscover
what it is to be a panda.

566
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,290
You have to learn
to live like a panda,

567
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:56,010
sleep like a panda...

568
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,610
Eat like a panda.

569
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:01,370
Those 103 dumplings?

570
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:03,520
I was just warming up.

571
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,100
I've always felt like
I wasn't eating up

572
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,130
to my full potential.

573
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:09,120
No, you can't take po
away from me.

574
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,270
No, no.
I want a second opinion.

575
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:14,290
Shifu, open another scroll
or something.

576
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,650
I think he should go.

577
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,480
Fine, a third opinion.

578
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,820
Monkey? Viper?
Tigress?

579
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,510
Dad, you heard what Shifu said,
Oogway said.

580
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:25,370
This guy can only be stopped
by a master of chi.

581
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:28,860
And I can only master chi
by knowing who I really am.

582
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:31,960
Well, I'm a panda.

583
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:38,230
I'll pack you a lunch
for the road.

584
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:47,020
Do you really think
Po can master chi in time?

585
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,680
It doesn't matter what I think.

586
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,780
It only matters
what the universe thinks.

587
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,750
So, that's a "no"?

588
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,620
Master, what are we going to do?

589
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,690
You are going to find out
where Kai is.

590
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:58,520
Follow the trail
of those Jade creatures.

591
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,110
But do not engage...

592
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:03,640
For with every foe he faces,
Kai becomes stronger.

593
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:06,170
Why me?
Is it because I asked?

594
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:09,390
No. It is because you can fly.
Go!

595
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,470
Should have kept your beak shut.

596
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,770
And take Mantis.

597
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:14,290
What? Oh, man.
Is it because I...?

598
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,920
Yes.

599
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,100
Oh! Lunch break.

600
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,370
Oh.

601
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:46,610
- You don't need to ask me twice.
- Ow...

602
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,640
Dad?

603
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,680
- Yes?
- Dad?

604
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:50,780
Yes?

605
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,310
What are you doing here?

606
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:54,890
What am I doing?
Getting a backache.

607
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,920
Did you have to step
on every rock?

608
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,760
No, I mean,
why are you here?

609
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,590
What was I supposed to do, huh?

610
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:02,690
What if the pandas
don't have food you like?

611
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,630
You're never gonna be able
to save the world

612
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,690
on an empty stomach.

613
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:09,160
I consider my presence
mission critical.

614
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,630
Oh... yes, about that...

615
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:15,040
We can't share the location of the village
with others. So...

616
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:17,740
Well, you think I can't
keep a secret, huh?

617
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,760
I raised Po for 20 years

618
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:22,210
before I finally told him
he was adopted.

619
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:24,150
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

620
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:27,910
Okay. I guess it would be
cruel to make you fly back.

621
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,620
You can fly?

622
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,720
I'm a bird, Po.

623
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,020
We're here.

624
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,540
Sure looks like a long
ways up there.

625
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,680
And my son hates stairs.

626
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,450
So, let's go home.

627
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:04,150
We're pandas.
We don't do stairs.

628
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,810
I've waited my whole life
to hear those words.

629
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,760
Rats.

630
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:23,260
Whoa... huh?

631
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,150
This is the secret
panda village?

632
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:39,420
No wonder you keep it a secret.

633
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:42,620
If I lived here,
I wouldn't tell anyone either.

634
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,190
Now you can "whoa."

635
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,560
Whoa!

636
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:54,900
- Let's go!
- Over here! Come on!

637
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,710
Look over there!

638
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,690
Oh...

639
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:23,980
- My turn! My turn!
- Come on, faster, faster!

640
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,510
Li?

641
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:28,330
Everyone!
Li's back!

642
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,370
They're both back!
He found his son!

643
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:31,660
He made it!
They're back!

644
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:33,240
- Li?
- He found his son!

645
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,210
Everyone!
Li's back!

646
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:37,450
Hang on, we're coming!

647
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,230
He made it!
Whoo-hoo!

648
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,310
They made it!
Why are we running?

649
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,850
- Here we come!
- He's back!

650
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,750
They made it!

651
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:47,630
Li shan is back!

652
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,830
Hi!

653
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,070
Everyone!

654
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:01,670
Everyone, gather around!
This is my son!

655
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:02,940
- Hello, hi.
- He's here!

656
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,440
- You're here!
- Triplets!

657
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:07,280
- Hi, I'm Ku Ku! - I'm Meng Meng.
- I'm Shuai Shuai.

658
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:09,280
- Your fur is soft.
- He smells like cookies.

659
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,720
He's so handsome,
just like his father.

660
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,050
Thank you.

661
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,990
Son, these are your cousins.

662
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,620
Dim and sum.

663
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,750
I have cousins!

664
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:19,950
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

665
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:21,720
Whoa!
Buns on a string.

666
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,450
- We call it a snacklace.
- That's right.

667
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,220
Uh... we'll make you
another one.

668
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,360
Oh!

669
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,890
It's you!

670
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,460
So... That's nice.
Yeah, hi!

671
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,360
I don't know who you are.

672
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:36,950
Oh, stripey baby.
So beautiful.

673
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:39,270
Oh! Okay, careful with that.
That's my action figure.

674
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:40,780
Can I keep her?
Can I?

675
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:44,450
No... problem.
Of course.

676
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,600
Yeah.
That's why I brought her.

677
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,910
Take good care of her.

678
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:49,510
Yes!
Stripey baby.

679
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:54,740
You look just like me,
but a baby.

680
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:59,990
You're like me, but old.

681
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:03,060
You're like me, but fatter!

682
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,900
You're like me, but...

683
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,860
woooo...
with a hat.

684
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,300
He does wear a hat!

685
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,640
You all look like me.

686
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:16,910
Let's feast in my son's honor.

687
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,220
What the...?

688
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:23,280
Pandas don't walk.
We roll!

689
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:30,210
Have you ever seen anyone
look so ridiculous?

690
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,710
Po, what are you doing?
Po!

691
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,870
Ohh!
Ow!

692
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:50,770
You're right,
that is better than walking.

693
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,580
Mmm!

694
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,100
- Yeah, that's the good stuff.
- Have some dumplings.

695
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,450
What kind of panda
doesn't know how to roll?

696
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,990
Well, I'm kind of new at this
whole "being a panda" thing.

697
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:02,790
Hey, what kind of panda are you?

698
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,390
You have a funny neck.

699
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:05,620
I'm not a panda at all.

700
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,930
- What's that? What's that?
- My hat. My beak.

701
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:07,990
- What's that?
- My wing.

702
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,760
- What's that?
- My dumplings.

703
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,100
No more questions!
Go away, kid.

704
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,670
Here, son.
I packed your chopsticks.

705
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:14,930
- Thanks, dad.
- Wow.

706
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,440
- Oh, my.
- What?

707
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,900
What are those for?

708
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,110
These?
These are chopsticks.

709
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,140
They're for picking
up dumplings.

710
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:24,640
You mean you only eat
one at a time?

711
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:28,210
- Yummy.
- Yeah, yummy.

712
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,820
I knew I wasn't eating
up to my potential!

713
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,970
Huh?

714
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:50,140
I am Mei Mei.

715
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:53,510
Wow, she's amazing.
She's so beautiful.

716
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,140
That's sweet, Po.

717
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,580
But please, try to save
all other compliments

718
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:00,320
until after the performance.

719
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,420
Me?
No, I didn't say...

720
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,450
Shhh. Shhh.
Shut it.

721
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,120
After the performance.

722
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,580
Huh!
Has it started yet?

723
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:15,760
Best ribbon dancer in the world!

724
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,160
At least, that's what she said.

725
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,960
Look away.
Look away.

726
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,440
No.
You can't, can you?

727
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:23,900
Dad, why does she
keep staring at me like...

728
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,000
That!

729
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:27,190
Try to keep up.

730
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,040
I don't really know
how to dance!

731
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:34,060
Of course you do.
All pandas dance.

732
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,130
- I know what you were thinking.
- You do?

733
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:39,480
"How can one
panda be so beautiful?"

734
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,090
For me?
Oh!

735
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:47,230
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Po.

736
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:49,240
- Help me, Dads.
- Yeah, no, you're on your own.

737
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:51,200
You're doing great, son.

738
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,540
Your turn.

739
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,580
Oh!

740
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,530
Huh?

741
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:09,180
Yay, po!

742
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:13,100
Don't worry.
You'll get the hang of it.

743
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,890
I have so much to learn.

744
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,700
Wings of surveillance!

745
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,450
- Why do you do that?
- Do what?

746
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:30,280
Just because you say
"wings of" before something...

747
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,020
It doesn't mean that you're
doing a special move.

748
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:34,540
It's like me saying
"antenna of power"

749
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:37,680
or "thorax of making sandwiches."

750
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,260
Wings of disagreement.

751
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:41,350
Whoa!
There.

752
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:44,250
Master Bear,
master Chicken, master Croc!

753
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,920
What are you doing out here?

754
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,890
Jade creatures
attacked our villages.

755
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,990
- We've tracked them here.
- Stop!

756
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:55,490
They must be in there.

757
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,480
Master Shifu strongly
advised us...

758
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,040
Not to engage.

759
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,570
- We've gotta get in there.
- But master Shifu said...

760
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:06,010
You're seriously afraid?

761
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,640
Even master Chicken's going in there!
And he's a chicken.

762
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,180
That's it.
I'm going in.

763
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,320
- Mantis! We have orders not to...
- They need our help!

764
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,330
Come on.
I'll go high, you go low.

765
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,990
No, wait.

766
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,660
Fear the bug!

767
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,410
All right, you little...

768
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,560
Uh-oh!

769
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,900
Hold on, buddy.
I'm coming!

770
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:33,210
Antenna of power!
Ah! It didn't work!

771
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,240
Mantis!

772
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,210
Mantis?

773
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:43,780
Mantis.

774
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,910
Huh!

775
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:58,090
Your chi is strong.

776
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:00,160
Just like your friend...

777
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,990
The bug.

778
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:04,230
Huh!
Mantis.

779
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:14,610
Don't worry, little birdie.

780
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:17,610
I'll put your chi to good use...

781
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:22,390
Destroying the Jade palace
and everyone in it.

782
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:24,090
No!

783
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:33,010
Wings of regret!

784
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,330
Hmm.
Oh, yeah.

785
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:42,800
First day of panda training!

786
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,640
All right, flower.

787
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,940
I'm gonna make you bloom.

788
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,840
Whoo-hoo!

789
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:50,140
Dad.
Dad.

790
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,590
What? What?
What is it?

791
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:53,250
I'm ready for my first day
of panda training.

792
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,750
What?
You know, learn to be a panda,

793
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,680
master chi,
save the world!

794
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,220
Pandas sleep till past noon.

795
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:02,090
So lesson number one is,
"go back to bed."

796
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:04,320
Oh!
Of course!

797
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:09,330
Nobody said this was
gonna be easy.

798
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:16,030
Did I oversleep?

799
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,140
You sure did.

800
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,370
Yes!

801
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:19,740
Yeah!
Show him, kids!

802
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,710
- Can you do this? Can you do that?
- Heh!

803
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:22,940
How about this?
How about that?

804
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,780
- Am I doing it? Is this good?
- Whoa!

805
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,010
I got it!
Ka-blam!

806
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,380
Whoa!

807
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,350
- Uh. Grandma panda, heads up!
- Hello! Ow!

808
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,280
Oh.
Uh-oh.

809
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,180
We better roll.

810
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,920
Po, lunch time.

811
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,560
Oh!

812
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,400
Po?

813
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,460
You gotta let the hill
tell you where to roll.

814
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,100
Oh!
Rookie mistake.

815
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,400
Dim, sum, let's show him
how we go uphill!

816
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,240
Whoo-hoo!

817
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,940
It's beautiful.

818
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:56,510
- Snack time. Po!
- Whoo-hoo!

819
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:58,240
You can fly?

820
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,010
- I'm coming in hot!
- Oh oh.

821
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:03,490
Get them while they're cold.
Hmm.

822
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,110
Yeah!

823
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:06,720
What are you doing there?

824
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,120
That food is for Po!

825
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,900
Throw it in!

826
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,980
There, there.
That's it.

827
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:17,030
- Feeling relaxed?
- Totally.

828
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:19,510
Just let yourself fall into it.

829
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:21,180
Got it.

830
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:26,570
I'm fine.
I just...

831
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,510
There we go.
Just let it all out.

832
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,460
That's my boy.

833
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,510
Get out of there!

834
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,690
Oh! My noodles!

835
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,720
Leave my noodles alone.

836
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,960
Subtle, Po.
Very subtle.

837
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,790
Let me get some of that.

838
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,360
Oh!

839
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:50,700
Hey, leave my hat alone!

840
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:55,770
We love noodles!

841
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:56,970
More noodles!

842
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:59,440
Oh!
Just like my Po.

843
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:05,700
What are you guys looking at?

844
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:15,280
That's how we roll!
Cannonball!

845
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,660
Whoo-hoo!
Yeah!

846
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,800
Here, bring it up here.

847
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,790
Mom, look it!
Whoa!

848
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,930
How was that?

849
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,680
Whoa!

850
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:46,920
Now, you try again.
But don't try so hard.

851
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,220
Okay.
Okay.

852
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,460
Much better.

853
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:04,870
Thanks, dad.

854
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,370
For what?

855
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:08,410
You know, just for,
you know,

856
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:10,930
showing me what it feels like...

857
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,220
To be a panda.

858
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:15,990
So, when do you think
I'll be ready?

859
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:16,920
Ready?

860
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,950
You know, to learn
how to master chi.

861
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:21,520
Soon.
Real soon.

862
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,410
Come on, I wanna show you
something else.

863
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:24,970
Come on.

864
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:31,960
Sorry about the mess.
I don't usually get visitors.

865
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:45,610
Is this my mom?

866
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:54,180
I had this done
on your 100th day.

867
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,020
Hmm.

868
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:58,620
Your momma couldn't
hold you still.

869
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,770
You nearly ate the paper.

870
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,390
It's true.

871
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,940
What was she like?

872
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,600
Oh!

873
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:10,430
She was the total package.

874
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:14,410
Smart, beautiful...

875
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:16,890
Tremendous appetite.

876
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:20,480
She was the love of my life.

877
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,670
And then, just when I thought
I couldn't get any luckier...

878
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:28,810
Along you came.
My little Lotus.

879
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,490
I really had it all...

880
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:38,800
Until that one moment...

881
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:46,750
When I lost everything.

882
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:24,820
Dad.

883
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:28,780
You don't have to worry
about losing me ever again.

884
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:30,870
Okay?

885
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,850
Let me get some of that.

886
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:53,240
It's from the eastern province!

887
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:58,220
Master Lizard, master
Ox, master Eagle.

888
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,720
All of them.

889
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,800
In every village
from the sea to here...

890
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:05,680
Every master in China...
has vanished.

891
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:08,130
- Maybe they are all at a party.
- Monkey.

892
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:09,600
I didn't get invited either.

893
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:12,060
Kai has taken their chi.

894
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:14,660
We are all that stand
between him...

895
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:18,600
and the knowledge
Oogway left in our care.

896
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,460
The villagers, evacuated?

897
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:21,920
Done, master.

898
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:24,040
- Crane, Mantis?
- Still nothing.

899
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:26,510
Ha!
Wait. It's them!

900
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,750
No!

901
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:47,390
Kai.

902
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,020
Nice.

903
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,340
Very tacky.

904
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:58,170
How dare you set foot
on these grounds!

905
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:00,940
Look at you pathetic fools.

906
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,820
Groveling at the feet of Oogway,
the magnificent.

907
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:07,320
You are not fit
to speak his name.

908
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:10,610
I am not fit, little kitten?

909
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:14,350
I fought by his side.

910
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:16,820
I loved him like a brother.

911
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:21,420
And he betrayed me.

912
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,370
Well.

913
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:29,130
Now I will destroy
everything he has created!

914
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,810
Go!

915
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,090
How's that for a little kitten?

916
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:12,780
I will not let you
destroy Oogway's memory.

917
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:15,620
Why not?
He destroyed mine.

918
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:19,620
Mantis.
It is me, your bestie!

919
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:25,290
Sorry, Tigress!

920
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:28,210
Sorry! Sorry!
Sorry!

921
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:29,940
Sorry!

922
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,240
Shifu.

923
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,710
Bring them to me.

924
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,050
Heh, ha ha ha ha!

925
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,220
No.

926
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:00,000
- You must warn Po.
- Master, please.

927
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:12,690
I will show you the true
power of chi, brother.

928
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:15,290
No.

929
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:54,250
Oogway, forgive me.

930
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:57,720
Hmm.
What do you say, Oogway?

931
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,980
Do you forgive him?

932
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:02,800
You may have destroyed
the Jade palace...

933
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:05,690
But you will never succeed.

934
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:09,590
There will always
be someone to stop you.

935
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,660
Who?
The panda?

936
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:14,540
His chi is strong, but...

937
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,540
it won't be enough.

938
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:20,960
He will meet
the same fate as you.

939
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:26,130
- No.
- And so will every panda in that village.

940
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:33,600
Yes.

941
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:40,060
Huh.
Po, I hope you're ready.

942
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,060
Dance, Lotus. Dance.

943
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:49,090
He's so handsome.

944
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,400
Ooh!

945
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,300
Hi!

946
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:54,100
That's a panda hug!

947
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,990
Hey.

948
00:51:58,110 --> 00:52:00,600
Woo.
Eh Ha ha ha.

949
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:02,590
Po.

950
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:39,810
Tigress?

951
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,720
Who's she?

952
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,690
Who is that?

953
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:48,860
Huh!
Big stripey baby!

954
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:50,050
Hmm.

955
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,930
- What are you doing here?
- Kai attacked the valley.

956
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:55,870
He's taken every master in China,
including Shifu and the others.

957
00:52:55,870 --> 00:52:58,820
It's-It's all gone, Po.
Everything. Everyone.

958
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,060
Everyone?

959
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:01,510
Everyone.

960
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:03,800
How's my restaurant?

961
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:06,110
We'll talk later.

962
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:07,850
And now he's on his way here.

963
00:53:07,870 --> 00:53:10,010
He's after you, Po.

964
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,380
He's after all pandas.

965
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:14,850
- How long do we have?
- Not long.

966
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:16,990
Please, tell me
you've mastered chi.

967
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:18,560
- Here, take the baby.
- Dad! Dad!

968
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:19,890
Okay, who belongs to this one?

969
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:21,760
You need to teach me
the secret chi technique now!

970
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,880
No, no, I'm afraid
you need more time.

971
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:25,850
Everyone, go get your things!

972
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:28,080
- Let me help you with that.
- I don't have more time. I need to learn it now!

973
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:29,930
Sorry, you're not ready.

974
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,570
Okay, pack everything!

975
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:33,080
- I am ready.
- Not quite.

976
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,260
What are you talking about?
I've done everything you've asked.

977
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:37,150
I've mastered napping,
sleeping in,

978
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,780
hammocks, hot tubs.

979
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:40,710
I am totally at one
with my panda parts.

980
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,160
Now why won't you show me?

981
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:44,510
Because I don't know it!

982
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,420
You what?

983
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,880
I don't know it, okay?
No one does.

984
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,980
Maybe we used to.
But...

985
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:54,890
But not anymore.

986
00:53:54,890 --> 00:53:57,890
- You lied?
- No, I...

987
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:00,500
Yes.

988
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,630
Wh... why?

989
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,530
To save your life!

990
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:07,970
I find out some blade-swinging maniac
is coming for you.

991
00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:11,380
What am I supposed to do?
Just let that happen?

992
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:16,020
Yes! I'm the dragon warrior.
Facing maniacs, that's my job!

993
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:19,210
But because of you,
I left the valley unprotected.

994
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:21,190
I left my friends unprotected!

995
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:23,450
And now they're all...

996
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:26,760
- They're all...
- And you would have been, too.

997
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:29,890
I lost you once.

998
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:32,800
I am not going
to lose you again.

999
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,940
I can't.

1000
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:42,870
You just did.

1001
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:55,820
Mom!
Pick me!

1002
00:54:57,510 --> 00:55:00,020
- Oh.
- Oh!

1003
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:04,230
Po, I'm so worried for you...

1004
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,860
That I can't even enjoy
being right about everything.

1005
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,840
Now run, run, run, as fast as
those chubby legs can go!

1006
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:11,600
Run?
There's nowhere to run.

1007
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,170
But what are you going to do?

1008
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:16,080
I'm gonna stay,
and fight that monster.

1009
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:19,550
Po, he may be a monster,
but he's still your father.

1010
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:21,180
Not him.
Kai!

1011
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:23,680
HUH!
No!

1012
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,090
Hungry?

1013
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:11,640
No, I... not really.

1014
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:14,140
Well, maybe just one.

1015
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:18,380
You know, you weren't
the only one who was lying.

1016
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:19,700
Oh?

1017
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,210
I didn't really come along

1018
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:23,790
because I was worried Po
would go hungry.

1019
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:26,050
Ha ha ha.
I was worried about you.

1020
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:27,680
Worried that I'd go hungry?

1021
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,180
No.

1022
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:31,620
I was worried
you'd steal Po from me.

1023
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:32,880
I'd what?

1024
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:36,050
I know.
That was crazy.

1025
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:41,900
But I realize having you in
Po's life doesn't mean less for me.

1026
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:44,640
It means more for Po.

1027
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:45,970
Oh.

1028
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:49,740
Well, I'm not in his life.

1029
00:56:49,770 --> 00:56:51,240
Not anymore.

1030
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,840
Your son got mad at you.

1031
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,710
Welcome to parenthood.

1032
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:58,910
You don't understand.
I lied to him.

1033
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:00,560
He'll never forgive me.

1034
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:03,050
I lied to him for 20 years.

1035
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:05,730
He still thinks
he came from an egg.

1036
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:11,120
Sometimes, we do the wrong things
for the right reasons.

1037
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:21,260
Look.
He's hurt.

1038
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:23,670
He's confused.

1039
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:26,950
And he still has
to save the world.

1040
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:30,470
He needs both his dads.

1041
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:49,730
This isn't going to work.

1042
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:51,030
It has to.

1043
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:52,100
You're not thinking straight.

1044
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:53,670
- I am!
- You're not.

1045
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:54,700
- I am!
- No.

1046
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,590
- Yes, I am.
- No.

1047
00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:58,160
I've seen Kai.

1048
00:57:58,190 --> 00:57:59,660
I've seen what he can do.

1049
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,680
But he hasn't seen
what I can do.

1050
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,780
The wuxi finger hold?

1051
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:08,980
It's my best move.

1052
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:10,350
I just have to get to Kai,

1053
00:58:10,350 --> 00:58:12,020
grab his finger
and then skadoosh!

1054
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:13,720
Back to the spirit realm.

1055
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,380
- He has an army of Jade warriors.
- Oh.

1056
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:17,260
Everything they see, he sees.

1057
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,080
So there's no
sneaking up on him.

1058
00:58:19,110 --> 00:58:22,470
- You will never get close enough.
- It's gonna work!

1059
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:26,620
He can only be stopped
by a master of chi.

1060
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:29,200
Oh, you sound just like Shifu
with the, "chi, chi, chi."

1061
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,170
"Chi this. Chi that."
"Chi, chi, chi!"

1062
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:33,470
I'm not a master of chi, okay?

1063
00:58:33,470 --> 00:58:35,010
I don't know if
I'm the dragon warrior.

1064
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:36,520
I don't even know
if I'm a panda!

1065
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:38,850
I don't know who I am!

1066
00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:41,860
You're right.

1067
00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:44,910
There's no way
I can stop him and his army.

1068
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,300
Unless you had
an army of your own.

1069
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:55,490
You?

1070
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,480
Not just me.

1071
00:58:57,510 --> 00:58:58,900
Us.

1072
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:00,670
All of us.

1073
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:14,190
I finally found my son,
after all these years.

1074
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:16,850
It's going to take a lot more
than the end of the world...

1075
00:59:16,850 --> 00:59:18,150
To keep us apart.

1076
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:20,080
But you don't even know kung fu.

1077
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:22,450
Then you will teach us.

1078
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,450
What?
I can't teach you kung fu.

1079
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:30,650
I couldn't even teach Tigress.
And she already knows kung fu!

1080
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:36,840
Po, I know I'm the last guy
you wanna trust right now.

1081
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:38,360
But you gotta believe me.

1082
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:40,070
We can do this.

1083
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:42,240
We can learn kung fu.

1084
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:45,700
We can be just like you!

1085
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:48,150
- What did you just say?
- Uh...

1086
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:49,920
- "We can do this"?
- No!

1087
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:51,870
- "We can learn kung fu"?
- After that!

1088
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:53,460
Uh... I...
"We can be just like you"?

1089
00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:54,980
- Yes!
- We can?

1090
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:58,030
No! You can't!
Ho ho ho ho ho.

1091
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:00,500
But you don't have to be!

1092
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,230
That's what Shifu meant.

1093
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:03,750
I don't have to
turn you into me.

1094
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:06,270
I have to turn you into you!

1095
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:08,070
That doesn't make any sense.

1096
01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:10,030
I know!

1097
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,570
Thanks, Dads.

1098
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:13,440
- You're welcome?
- You're welcome?

1099
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:16,140
I'm gonna do something
I never thought I'd be able to do.

1100
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:19,040
I'm gonna teach kung fu.

1101
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:23,080
You guys, your real strength
comes from being

1102
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,320
the best "you" you can be.

1103
01:00:24,350 --> 01:00:25,850
So who are you?

1104
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:28,550
<i>What are you good at?
What do you love?</i>

1105
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:32,100
- <i>What makes you, "you"?</i>
- Whoo-hoo!

1106
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:36,130
Yes, good. Good.
Again.

1107
01:00:38,310 --> 01:00:40,540
Good.
Again.

1108
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:42,720
Good, good, good.
Again.

1109
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:43,950
Huh?

1110
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:47,180
Stripey baby!
Stripey baby!

1111
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:50,050
Faster, faster!
Twirl those ribbons!

1112
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,410
Hug that log, you!

1113
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:53,120
Hug that log
like it's the last time

1114
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:55,150
you're ever gonna hug it
goodbye forever.

1115
01:00:55,170 --> 01:00:56,990
Higher! And a little more
to the left this time.

1116
01:00:57,010 --> 01:00:59,580
- You can do it!
- Whoo-hoo!

1117
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:01,350
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1118
01:01:01,350 --> 01:01:03,940
I don't wanna see
any of these hit the ground!

1119
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:17,260
Wait, wait, stripey baby!

1120
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:20,250
Good!
Try it with this.

1121
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,490
Now try it with these!

1122
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:30,830
Good!
Now try it with these.

1123
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:34,130
Oh!

1124
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,830
- Ow!
- Oh!

1125
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:37,200
Ow!

1126
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:04,150
Whoo!

1127
01:02:04,450 --> 01:02:06,750
They are ready.

1128
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,620
Baby, hehehe.

1129
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,380
What?

1130
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:12,670
Okay, pay attention because
I'm only gonna go over this

1131
01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:14,360
10 more times.

1132
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:17,090
The only entrance
to the village is here.

1133
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:19,490
The dumpling squadron
will take position here...

1134
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:22,030
While the cookie squadron
will take position here.

1135
01:02:22,050 --> 01:02:25,200
Now, on my signal,
the two squadrons will...

1136
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:28,970
Right, okay.

1137
01:02:28,990 --> 01:02:31,090
The noodle squadron will...

1138
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,350
Ha ha ha ha.

1139
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:37,770
Alright. Okay.
Anyway, the important thing to remember

1140
01:02:37,790 --> 01:02:40,380
is that this is the spot
where...

1141
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:44,390
Okay, I saw that coming.

1142
01:02:44,390 --> 01:02:47,240
If you only remember one thing,
it's distract the jombies...

1143
01:02:47,270 --> 01:02:50,300
Until I get close enough to
put a wuxi finger hold on Kai.

1144
01:02:50,330 --> 01:02:51,400
You got it?

1145
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:53,190
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1146
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:55,330
Pandas on three!
One, two three, Pan...!

1147
01:02:55,350 --> 01:02:59,290
You guys... never mind,
I'll teach you that later.

1148
01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:37,460
I wish I could have
taught you this, son.

1149
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,930
It's okay, dad.
I'm...

1150
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:43,480
- Huh!
- Huh!

1151
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:47,710
He's here.

1152
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:14,190
Wow!

1153
01:04:14,210 --> 01:04:17,080
That's what I call
a dramatic entrance!

1154
01:04:20,210 --> 01:04:23,560
Ha-ha!
You must be the dragon warrior.

1155
01:04:23,590 --> 01:04:26,470
And you must be Kai!

1156
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:30,040
Beast of vengeance,
maker of widows!

1157
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:33,600
Yes! Finally!
Thank you!

1158
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,610
Almost makes me wanna
spare your life.

1159
01:04:35,630 --> 01:04:37,270
Oh, you wanna spare me?

1160
01:04:37,270 --> 01:04:39,300
How about you spare me
the chit-chat?

1161
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:41,370
All right?
Let's do this.

1162
01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:43,540
I'm going to take your chi...

1163
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:46,140
Then the chi
of every panda in the...

1164
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:47,580
Oh!
Chit-chat!

1165
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:49,250
- In this...
- Chitty-chitty chat-chat.

1166
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:51,180
- In...
- Chat, chat, chat.

1167
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:52,550
- In the...
- Chit-chat!

1168
01:04:52,550 --> 01:04:55,620
Oh, you pudgy little...

1169
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:02,150
Round them all up.

1170
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:17,410
Oh, no.
It's true.

1171
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:19,720
You guys have all been
turned green!

1172
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:23,360
Except for you, Mantis.
You were already green.

1173
01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:26,770
- Now?
- Wait for the signal.

1174
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,260
HAAAA!

1175
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:30,430
Here we go!

1176
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:41,800
Dumpling squad!

1177
01:05:41,830 --> 01:05:43,810
- Ready?
- Go time!

1178
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:46,270
- Belly!
- Gong!

1179
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:48,200
Whoo!

1180
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:50,190
Seriously?

1181
01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:52,180
- Yeah! Whoo!
- We did it! Whoo-hoo!

1182
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:54,020
Sorry, Crane.

1183
01:06:01,690 --> 01:06:05,020
Spring roll squad!
Time for some takeout!

1184
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:12,740
Yoo-hoo!

1185
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:15,050
Over here, Mr. jombie!

1186
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:22,490
I don't know
who you are, either.

1187
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:24,380
Noodle squad!

1188
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:30,620
Get ready to dance...
with danger!

1189
01:06:30,650 --> 01:06:32,560
Waaahhh!

1190
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:36,570
Oh, sweet!

1191
01:06:47,630 --> 01:06:49,960
- Stripey baby!
- Huh! Oh, no.

1192
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:51,550
Weeee!

1193
01:06:54,290 --> 01:06:56,570
- Do it.
- You're mean!

1194
01:07:01,890 --> 01:07:04,160
Fire!

1195
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,350
Fire in the hole!

1196
01:07:10,370 --> 01:07:11,380
Oh!

1197
01:07:11,410 --> 01:07:12,460
Yes!

1198
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:14,330
All right, kids!

1199
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:16,360
You got it, guys!

1200
01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:21,890
Oh, no!
Master Shifu!

1201
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:24,490
I can't hit Shifu!

1202
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:27,100
I can!

1203
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:29,630
And so can I.

1204
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:32,410
- Double-dad defense!
- Double-dad defense!

1205
01:07:32,410 --> 01:07:33,610
- Left, Dad!
- Right, Dad!

1206
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:36,310
- Thanks, dad!
- Back at you, dad.

1207
01:07:36,330 --> 01:07:38,220
We've got this, son!

1208
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:39,550
Ho ho!
Go, Dads!

1209
01:07:39,550 --> 01:07:41,080
Yeah!

1210
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:45,660
Yeah!
Ha ha!

1211
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:47,140
We got them now.

1212
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:50,730
Stop. Stop!
Enough!

1213
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:54,180
Get out...

1214
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:57,240
Eeeee!

1215
01:07:57,270 --> 01:07:59,540
Let's finish this.

1216
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,730
That's our boy!

1217
01:08:17,490 --> 01:08:20,670
Sorry, buddy. Gotta send you
back to the spirit realm.

1218
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:22,810
Skadoosh!

1219
01:08:24,050 --> 01:08:26,970
Okay, that didn't work.
Let me try one more time.

1220
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,600
Skadoosh! Skadoosh. Skadoosh.
Skadoo... what the...?

1221
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,740
Hold on, wait!
It's working.

1222
01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:34,880
No.
No!

1223
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:41,600
No, it's not.

1224
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:44,000
Did Oogway teach you
that little trick?

1225
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:45,480
Too bad.

1226
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:47,690
It only works on mortals.

1227
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:51,570
And I am a spirit warrior.

1228
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,330
Come!

1229
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:23,120
Whoa!

1230
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:39,600
Son!

1231
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:41,430
Po!

1232
01:09:43,190 --> 01:09:44,580
I was wrong.

1233
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:48,020
I'm sorry.
Run. Run!

1234
01:09:59,490 --> 01:10:01,280
So, Oogway...

1235
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:05,140
This was the one
destined to stop me?

1236
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:07,760
I will have his chi...

1237
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:11,100
And then all of theirs!

1238
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:28,650
And you...
Heh heh heh heh.

1239
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:33,720
You really thought you could send
me back to the spirit realm?

1240
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:42,210
You are just a stupid mortal.

1241
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:45,370
It only works on mortals.

1242
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:50,290
You're right.
I can't send you there.

1243
01:10:50,670 --> 01:10:52,620
But I can take you there.

1244
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,280
What's that?

1245
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:56,630
What?

1246
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:58,600
- Po!
- Son!

1247
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:00,030
Skadoosh.

1248
01:11:00,050 --> 01:11:02,330
- Huh! Son!
- Son!

1249
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,290
No!

1250
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:26,710
What happened?
Where...

1251
01:11:26,710 --> 01:11:28,510
Where's po?

1252
01:11:28,510 --> 01:11:31,580
He took Kai away.
He saved us.

1253
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:33,580
No.

1254
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:38,220
He saved us,
but who's saving him?

1255
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:43,760
Whoa!

1256
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:46,000
The spirit realm.
It worked!

1257
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:48,870
- Awww!
- Get off me, you...

1258
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:51,970
You brought me back?

1259
01:11:51,970 --> 01:11:54,610
Don't blame me. I tried to finish
this in the regular realm.

1260
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:57,190
Then we'll finish it here!

1261
01:12:04,730 --> 01:12:06,480
Whoa!

1262
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:33,990
Come on, son.
Fight!

1263
01:12:40,510 --> 01:12:42,690
We have to help him.

1264
01:12:42,690 --> 01:12:44,020
We have to help him!

1265
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:45,520
Okay.
Everyone gather around.

1266
01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:47,640
That's it.
Come in close. Come on.

1267
01:12:47,670 --> 01:12:50,130
We can do this.

1268
01:12:57,150 --> 01:12:58,740
<i>Po...</i>

1269
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:02,340
You taught us who
we were meant to be.

1270
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:07,850
A father.

1271
01:13:11,110 --> 01:13:13,120
A friend.

1272
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:14,690
A dumpling kicker.

1273
01:13:14,690 --> 01:13:16,150
A lethal fighting machine.

1274
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:18,220
A hugger.

1275
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:21,620
A nunchuck chick.

1276
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:24,290
Stripey baby.

1277
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:27,240
A family.

1278
01:13:56,170 --> 01:13:58,050
Sweet!

1279
01:13:58,070 --> 01:13:59,360
AHH!

1280
01:14:05,670 --> 01:14:08,470
Whoa...

1281
01:14:12,910 --> 01:14:14,750
Who are you?

1282
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:17,380
I've been asking
the same question.

1283
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:23,390
Am I the son of a panda?

1284
01:14:23,390 --> 01:14:25,160
The son of a goose?

1285
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:27,060
A student?

1286
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:29,320
A teacher?

1287
01:14:29,630 --> 01:14:31,930
Turns out...

1288
01:14:31,930 --> 01:14:33,860
I'm all of them.

1289
01:14:41,970 --> 01:14:46,240
I am the dragon warrior.

1290
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:48,920
Get it?
See the giant dragon?

1291
01:14:48,950 --> 01:14:50,260
Ha ha ha!

1292
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:52,880
Get ready to feel the thunder.

1293
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:55,320
This is awesome!

1294
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:58,080
Ho ho ho ho.
Ha ha!

1295
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:03,320
Whoo-hoo!

1296
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:06,780
Hmm.

1297
01:15:12,790 --> 01:15:14,760
Uh-oh.

1298
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:22,580
Belly gong.

1299
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:24,960
Butt slap.

1300
01:15:27,290 --> 01:15:30,680
Perhaps a bit of lunch.
'cause I'm starving.

1301
01:15:33,590 --> 01:15:35,560
Mmm.

1302
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:51,390
Let's do this!

1303
01:15:51,410 --> 01:15:52,710
Yaahh!

1304
01:15:55,550 --> 01:15:57,550
Heads up!

1305
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:15,630
It took me 500 years
to take Oogway's chi.

1306
01:16:15,660 --> 01:16:19,200
I will have yours
if it takes me 500 more.

1307
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:20,540
Chitty-chitty chat-chat.

1308
01:16:20,570 --> 01:16:22,960
Chit-chat.

1309
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:35,180
You want my chi
so bad...

1310
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:37,120
Then take it.

1311
01:16:43,230 --> 01:16:45,030
Yes.

1312
01:16:45,030 --> 01:16:48,360
The power is mine.

1313
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:52,740
Wait.
No. It's too much.

1314
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:55,640
That's too much!
No!

1315
01:16:58,940 --> 01:17:01,310
No!

1316
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:12,670
Oh!

1317
01:17:12,690 --> 01:17:14,760
Hoo haa.
Where did he go?

1318
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:20,710
Oh!

1319
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:24,300
- We're back!
- Bestie!

1320
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,070
I'm still green!
It didn't work!

1321
01:17:26,090 --> 01:17:28,530
Oh, wait.
That's my normal green.

1322
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:29,710
Greeny baby!

1323
01:17:29,730 --> 01:17:32,090
Not a baby.
Not a baby!

1324
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:33,770
Antenna of fear!

1325
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:35,110
What about Po?

1326
01:17:35,110 --> 01:17:38,460
- Have you seen Po?
- No. He's not here?

1327
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:41,120
Po?
Po?

1328
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,530
Why isn't he back?

1329
01:17:53,430 --> 01:17:55,300
Dragon warrior.

1330
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:58,600
Oogway?
Whoa!

1331
01:18:00,830 --> 01:18:02,210
I can't believe it.

1332
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:03,670
- Heh heh heh heh.
- Whoa!

1333
01:18:03,670 --> 01:18:06,300
- You are extra shiny.
- As are you.

1334
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:08,430
I know, right?
It's like the best cape ever.

1335
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:10,760
When I run with it,
then it looks really cool.

1336
01:18:10,790 --> 01:18:13,120
It suits you.
You've grown.

1337
01:18:13,150 --> 01:18:15,020
Yep. I gotta lay off
the panda buffet.

1338
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:17,610
Grown up...

1339
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:22,090
As I hoped you would when I sent
the message to your father.

1340
01:18:22,110 --> 01:18:25,660
Huh! You sent the universe mail.
Whoa!

1341
01:18:25,690 --> 01:18:27,400
Yes.

1342
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:30,130
Because the universe needed you.

1343
01:18:30,130 --> 01:18:31,800
Me?

1344
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:36,950
You finally became the panda
you were always meant to be.

1345
01:18:36,970 --> 01:18:39,250
But, how'd you know I could?

1346
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:41,510
On the first day we met...

1347
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:45,570
I saw the future of kung fu.

1348
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:50,410
<i>And the past.</i>

1349
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:56,270
<i>I saw the panda
who could unite them both.</i>

1350
01:18:56,290 --> 01:18:59,260
<i>That is why I chose you, Po.</i>

1351
01:18:59,260 --> 01:19:03,060
Both sides of a yin and Yang.

1352
01:19:03,460 --> 01:19:07,830
And my true successor.

1353
01:19:09,530 --> 01:19:12,080
Me?
I can't take that.

1354
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,810
Just take it.

1355
01:19:13,810 --> 01:19:16,100
I have a bigger one.

1356
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:20,290
I mean, you're enlightened
and everything. I'm just...

1357
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,770
Oh!

1358
01:19:22,790 --> 01:19:23,890
Really?

1359
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:25,760
Yes.

1360
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:37,200
Now what do we do?

1361
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:40,100
Hmm.
You tell me.

1362
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:42,700
No.
Oogway, don't go!

1363
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:46,110
I'm not going anywhere.
I live here.

1364
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:48,470
Oh, right.

1365
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:52,590
It's you who must decide
whether to stay or go.

1366
01:19:52,810 --> 01:19:54,680
Wait.
I can go back?

1367
01:19:54,710 --> 01:19:58,340
Who knows?
I've never tried.

1368
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:14,130
Wow!

1369
01:20:24,580 --> 01:20:26,580
- Po!
- Oh!

1370
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:29,480
You can fly!
Oh!

1371
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:33,510
Ahhhhhh!
Oh!

1372
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:36,090
Dad.
Dad.

1373
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:37,450
Dads!

1374
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:39,380
- Son!
- Son!

1375
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:44,170
Don't you go disappearing
in petals ever again.

1376
01:20:44,170 --> 01:20:45,840
We thought we lost you.

1377
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:48,770
No, you saved me.

1378
01:20:48,790 --> 01:20:50,900
You all did.

1379
01:20:52,130 --> 01:20:54,830
Now, come on over here!

1380
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:56,700
Hugs!

1381
01:20:59,420 --> 01:21:01,320
Master Shifu!

1382
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:04,150
The student has truly
become the tea...

1383
01:21:04,170 --> 01:21:05,760
Wait.
Where did you get that?

1384
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:06,880
Oh, this.

1385
01:21:06,910 --> 01:21:09,070
Oogway gave it to me
in the spirit realm.

1386
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:11,230
Oh... of course he did.

1387
01:21:11,230 --> 01:21:13,790
I think I mastered chi.

1388
01:21:14,180 --> 01:21:17,670
Oh...
Of course you did.

1389
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:20,950
Can you teach me?

1390
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:25,610
Ready!

1391
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:46,500
Whoa!

1392
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:47,690
Ow!

1393
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:50,120
Ow!

1394
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:54,470
Monkey, help me!

1395
01:21:54,470 --> 01:21:56,000
Greeny baby!

1396
01:21:56,020 --> 01:21:58,020
Get her off me!

1397
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:06,880
Mmm!
Hello.

1398
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:08,700
Yah!

1399
01:22:08,730 --> 01:22:09,870
Yah!

1400
01:22:16,340 --> 01:22:18,040
Skadoosh.

1401
01:22:25,170 --> 01:22:27,220
Panda asthma.

1402
01:22:27,730 --> 01:22:29,240
Ha ha.
