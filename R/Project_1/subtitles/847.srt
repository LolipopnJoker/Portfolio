1
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,186
It had to be a cow.

2
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:20,024
Couldn't be like a dog or something
that isn't 10,000 pounds.

3
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,830
- Come on! Can you just help me, dude?
- I'm doing all the work here, man.

4
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,345
- Push! Push! Come on!
- Jason, it stepped on my foot.

5
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,546
Pull yourself together.

6
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,666
Just tie it to the bench

7
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,707
- and let's get out of here, please.
- Cow seems unhappy, huh?

8
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,259
Well, it shouldn't be unhappy,
because I just milked her.

9
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,427
Him.

10
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,502
- You just milked him.
- This is a him?

11
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,309
- Was it one udder?
- Yeah.

12
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,585
Yeah, that's not an udder, dude.

13
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,899
I was gonna say,
it was actually kinda weird.

14
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,549
It was really big,
and I had to use two hands.

15
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,542
- It didn't...
- Stop. We will never discuss this again.

16
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,620
That'd be great.

17
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,740
Cops!

18
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,264
The cops are coming.

19
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,669
Beefcake, hide!

20
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,990
What? I'm sorry, Beefcake!

21
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,823
Whoo!

22
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,820
Yeah!

23
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,939
Damn!

24
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,106
Whoa!

25
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,346
Okay.

26
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,106
Come on.

27
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,944
Whoo! Yeah!

28
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,386
Whoa!

29
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,029
Whoa!

30
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,306
You know, I don't think we're ever gonna
understand each other.

31
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:33,065
Just when I think you've done
the dumbest thing you could possibly do,

32
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,948
you find something
even dumber and you do it.

33
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,942
Thank you.

34
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,465
I promise you, this is not the moment
to be a wiseass.

35
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,820
And I know you think it's noble
that you didn't rat out your friends.

36
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,708
I acted alone.
Beefcake and I had a connection.

37
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,588
Yeah, that's funny.
You know what's not funny?

38
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,388
This was supposed to be your season.

39
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,462
I had scouts coming to every game.

40
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,940
You could have written your own ticket.
Now it's all gone.

41
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,987
Now you gotta come here every Saturday

42
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,710
for the rest of the year
just so you can graduate!

43
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,425
With all these other weirdos
and criminals.

44
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,749
Yeah.

45
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,948
Like you said,
we'll never understand each other.

46
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,147
One play left in the entire game.

47
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,586
Can Angel Grove do it?
They're down by five.

48
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:23,139
Jason Scott takes his position
at quarterback. Here comes the snap.

49
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,023
Wide receiver Marty Borne
looks like he's open.

50
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,703
He's getting ready for a pass.

51
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,066
Jason Scott makes...
no, no, wait, he doesn't make a pass!

52
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,307
What a pump fake!
He's running with the ball.

53
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,667
He's at the 20, the 15, the ten.
Jason Scott scores!

54
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,582
Touchdown!

55
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:40,550
Jason Scott singlehandedly
brings the team home for the championship!

56
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,459
Moo!

57
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,507
That's so funny.

58
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,946
Hey, you sure you're in the right room?

59
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,145
Oh, big tough guy.

60
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,665
This one goes here. That one goes there.

61
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,826
Primary colors go on this side,
this one goes...

62
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,424
I'm sorry.

63
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,580
Here, let me help you.

64
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,829
You're a freak. You know that?

65
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,663
I've had to watch you play
with these for weeks.

66
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,786
Are you crazy?

67
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,304
No? What if you had an extra one?

68
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,983
Freak.

69
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,982
Why don't you cut this little act
and do something?

70
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,424
Why don't you stop me? Huh?

71
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,263
- Are you gonna stop...
- Hey!

72
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,507
How old are you? Five?

73
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,100
Hi, I'm Jason. It's my first time here.
It's exciting.

74
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,870
And you must be the bully of detention.

75
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,509
How dumb can you be?

76
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,945
Oh!

77
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,619
Did you just slap me?

78
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,430
I did. Weird, right?

79
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,069
Now I'm gonna be here every day

80
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:11,143
for what seems like the rest of my life,
and I'm sure that you are, too.

81
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,823
So let's make a deal.

82
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,663
Don't sit near me,

83
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,740
or him,

84
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,025
and we'll be okay.

85
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,301
Okay!

86
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,944
Uh, approved homework,

87
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,386
or working on the Better Choices workbook.

88
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,348
- These should be out and in progress.
- I need to go to the ladies' room.

89
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:33,582
Uh... Okay. And good morning.

90
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,025
Oh, my God.

91
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,579
I got your text and I was like,
"Where are they?"

92
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,902
So, this is where you come every Saturday
instead of practice.

93
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,346
- God, this must suck.
- It does.

94
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,422
Well, then you shouldn't have
sent Ty that picture of me.

95
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:55,184
That's not exactly how it happened.
I mean, he's a liar.

96
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,785
- You punched his tooth out.
- They put it back.

97
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,066
Water under the bridge now. Let's move on.

98
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,267
Oh, thank God.

99
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,070
We're moving on. Without you.

100
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,426
Cutting you out. Literally.

101
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,548
You can show up for cheer practice
if you want,

102
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,383
but I wouldn't.

103
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,424
Damn, girl!

104
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,582
Oh, my God, what have you done?

105
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,700
Kimberly, what have you done to your hair?

106
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,906
You cut off your hair?

107
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,221
- Hey... door!
- Kimberly what...

108
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,983
Hey, thanks for that in there.

109
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,505
Ah, no worries. I hate guys like that.

110
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:30,266
Yeah. Oh... so, hey, we should,
uh, hang out sometime, huh?

111
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:33,224
Not that we have to.
But I think tonight we should.

112
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,069
- What's your name again?
- Billy.

113
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,709
Billy Cranston.

114
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,065
Or William Cranston.

115
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:41,149
You remember kids used to call me
Billy Crams-tons as a third-grade joke?

116
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,142
Like Billy crams tons of crayons
in his butt.

117
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,260
Which I didn't! But it's really impossible
to cram a ton of crayons in a butt.

118
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,386
- No, no, I'm sorry, I shouldn't say that.
- Okay, Billy,

119
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:51,542
I would honestly hang out with you,
but I have a date every night

120
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,189
with the Angel Grove Sheriff's Department.

121
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,545
So... I'm sorry.

122
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,906
Wait... no, no, no.
Don't leave, don't leave, hey.

123
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,028
All right, so I don't really expect
for us to hang out.

124
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,625
Truth is I need to get somewhere tonight,
and I could really use your help.

125
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,225
Billy, I hear you, but as I told you,
I have house arrest.

126
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,302
There's nothing I can do about it.
I'm sorry.

127
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,746
Well, like, I mean, I can fix that.

128
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:12,140
I know how to trick the SIM.
I have, uh... I have tools.

129
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,301
I have to be in my house before 7:00.

130
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,020
Well, if you come to my house before
7:00, then I can fix it for you.

131
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,705
Oh! I also have a car. Or access to a car.

132
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,703
And if you decide to help me,
you can have the car for a few hours.

133
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,987
Come on, honey. Let's go.

134
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,950
Don't be so hard on him.

135
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:55,226
How do you think he feels
walking around town now?

136
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,819
How do you think I feel
walking around town now?

137
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,105
Let's not do this tonight.

138
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,380
What's the plan, huh?

139
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,507
What's he gonna do with his life?

140
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,990
He could've been so much more.

141
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,783
Get out of the way!

142
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,224
Oh, my God, is that Jason Scott?

143
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,947
Oh, my God! Jason Scott!

144
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,625
- Billy?
- Yeah.

145
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,860
- Billy!
- Yes?

146
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,430
- It's 6:56...
- 6:56, I know.

147
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,910
You got four minutes. Grab that chair.

148
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,983
- What's all this stuff?
- It's objects that I found with my dad.

149
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,629
Most of it is his.

150
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:48,350
- Hey.
- Where's the cage? Where's the cage?

151
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,944
Here. Here it is.

152
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,584
- Put your foot in this.
- What is it?

153
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,105
It's a Faraday cage. It should stop
the cell signal if we're lucky.

154
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,340
That's the three-minute warning.

155
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:58,025
- Come on, bud. If the signal goes off...
- My dad's been dead

156
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,740
now seven years,
four months, and two days?

157
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,583
- Yeah, two days.
- Um, okay, um...

158
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,986
That's a long time.
He used to work at the mine.

159
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,426
Billy, I really don't think
that we have time...

160
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,189
You still live at 4455 Old Wharf?

161
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,420
- Yes... yes, I do.
- Great house.

162
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,826
- Okay.
- So, yeah, about my dad.

163
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,469
We used to go and find objects together.

164
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,779
Some really, really old.

165
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,020
I'm gonna get in trouble, Billy.

166
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,669
Oh! Almost like that show
American Pickers.

167
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,900
Billy, the signal's gonna go off.

168
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:21,980
We should've definitely
had our own TV show.

169
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,504
That would've been so crazy.

170
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,229
What are you doing?

171
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,983
Dude, come on, seriously!

172
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,385
It's gonna go... Billy, come on!

173
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,462
What?

174
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,470
Thank you.

175
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,946
Mmm-hmm. Can you stop touching me now?

176
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,949
It's so cool you actually showed up.

177
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,669
Well, you are giving me the van.

178
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,549
Lending you the van. But, yeah.

179
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,700
How much further is it?

180
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:01,181
Just 44 minutes and 52 seconds.

181
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,744
Uh... Okay.

182
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,150
Thank you for helping me today.

183
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,262
That's okay, Billy.

184
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,669
Uh... Okay, this is the entrance

185
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,390
to the gold mine, and clearly,
Billy, the sign says...

186
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,541
Keep driving.

187
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:18,060
Okay.

188
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,267
If we find something cool,
then you can keep half.

189
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,740
- It's a rule that me and my dad made.
- Thanks, Billy.

190
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,789
They're gonna blow this whole thing.

191
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,145
It'll all be gone in a week.

192
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:31,143
Billy, can I be honest? The deal was
I drop you somewhere,

193
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,903
and I get the van for a few hours, okay?

194
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,390
This is weird.

195
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,944
Like, we don't know each other at all.

196
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,783
I don't know what we're doing here.

197
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,987
- And you seem kinda...
- Wait, I gotta tell you something, okay?

198
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,060
I'm on the spectrum.

199
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,503
Well, is that like a workout program?

200
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,706
Like Tae Bo?

201
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:49,022
No. It's a diagnosis. Excuse me.

202
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:52,268
I know. It was a joke. I was kidding.

203
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,148
See, that's the thing.
I didn't get the joke.

204
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:57,223
Like my brain doesn't work the same
as yours does, you know?

205
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:00,109
Yeah, well, consider that a good thing.

206
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:03,024
It's just that I can't read
humor or... or sarcasm.

207
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,339
- Oh! But I do remember things.
- Okay.

208
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,625
- I remember everything.
- Okay.

209
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,740
Billy, let me stop you.

210
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,025
Okay.

211
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:11,740
You don't need to tell me all this.
We're cool.

212
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,986
Okay. Well, we're almost there.

213
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,345
Which is good news, so...

214
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:19,264
take my spare flashlight now,
'cause it's gonna be dark

215
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,784
- when we get back.
- Bye, Billy!

216
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,985
Okay!

217
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,946
Ah, she's back again.

218
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,546
Oh, crazy girl.

219
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:46,020
Just like clockwork.

220
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,902
Who are you?

221
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:38,025
No way!

222
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,906
Uh... hello?

223
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,465
Hey!

224
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,990
Hey!

225
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:57,344
No, no, no, no. Kimberly!

226
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,579
Kimberly!

227
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,787
Okay. Okay.

228
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,709
- It's strange to hear you say my name.
- What?

229
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,510
What did you say?

230
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,980
I said, it's strange
to hear you say my name.

231
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,060
Like we know each other.

232
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:14,143
We... we do know each other.

233
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,462
Oh, we know who each other are,
but we don't really know each other.

234
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,149
I know you used to date Ty Fleming.

235
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,790
Oh. Then you know I punched his tooth out.

236
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,144
I know they put it back.

237
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:38,423
Dad, I hope you're watching.
Gonna make you proud.

238
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,619
Dad, I forgot to tell you, uh,

239
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,350
I took the van without
asking Mom's permission.

240
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,740
Well, I'm telling you,
so I think that's okay.

241
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,748
Anyways, I gotta focus. Okay.

242
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:53,102
So what are you doing up here?
Did you follow me?

243
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,944
I, uh, came with... Billy.

244
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:59,740
Billy Cranston? Weird.
But I've seen him up here before.

245
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,901
My house is on the other side
of the mountain.

246
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,186
I hike these trails sometimes,
clear my head,

247
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:08,502
and I stare down at Angel Grove and wonder

248
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,424
how such a small, crap town
could cause me such misery.

249
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,582
That funny to you?

250
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,542
No, I just... I feel the same way.

251
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:21,385
Yeah. Jason Scott, star quarterback,
crashes and burns.

252
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,541
Destroys his career
and destroys our season.

253
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,905
Go Tigers.

254
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,386
Yeah, now I walk around town
and everyone's looking at me

255
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,348
like I ran over their dog.

256
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,943
So why don't you leave? You know, just go.

257
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,909
- I could leave here, you know?
- Where?

258
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,219
God, anywhere.

259
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,869
So let's go.

260
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,589
What?

261
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,468
- You'd never do it.
- Try me.

262
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,183
Oh, what, you and me? You got a car?

263
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,626
- I have a van.
- Ooh, that's creepy.

264
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,905
It's not that kind of van.

265
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,470
Every van is that kind of van.

266
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,870
So, let's go.

267
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,981
Are you daring me? 'Cause I'll go.

268
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,580
Okay.

269
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,180
Dad, get ready.

270
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,105
That didn't work.

271
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:22,264
Whoa! Whoa!

272
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,830
- That really rung my bell.
- Hey, hey, hey!

273
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,026
Go, go, go, go, go!

274
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,863
- Oh! Wow!
- Hey!

275
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,020
What are you doing, dude?

276
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,510
I been digging up here for some years.

277
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:33,025
Hey! Easy, guy. Let's sort this out, huh?

278
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,942
- I seen him up here before.
- Hey, Jason.

279
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,306
Dude cannot be walking around
blowing stuff up!

280
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,347
I was just trying to dig a little deeper!

281
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,420
Maybe I dug too deep, huh?

282
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,945
Billy, you don't have to yell.
We can hear you, okay?

283
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,181
- Okay!
- Hey!

284
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:47,227
You guys looking
to get busted or something?

285
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,063
This place is a restricted area!

286
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,267
Oh, really, Einstein? Restricted?

287
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,990
As in, we shouldn't be standing
on crazy rocks

288
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,550
doing Karate Kid moves, right?

289
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,984
Uh... Guys...

290
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,060
Yeah. I see you.

291
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:01,268
Yeah, or camping out on old trains.
I see you, too, homeboy.

292
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,545
Uh, guys...

293
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,309
There's a lotta mine security out tonight.

294
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,665
- Who is she?
- I don't know.

295
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,979
I've never seen her before.

296
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,743
Oh, no.

297
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,179
Whoa!

298
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,910
Are you okay?

299
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,788
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

300
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,260
Whoa.

301
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,302
What is it?

302
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,585
Whoa.

303
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,862
I've never seen glass like this before.

304
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,350
Oh, my God.

305
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,827
What is it? What is that?

306
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,822
There's something in there.

307
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,220
Move.

308
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,779
- All right, watch out, watch out. Look!
- What are you doing?

309
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,782
- Wait, no, no, no! No, no!
- Seriously?

310
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,264
- What are you doing?
- Oh, yeah!

311
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,665
My dad always knew the right spots.

312
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,588
There's gotta be more. Let's get it!

313
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,144
- Get out of the way.
- That doesn't mean keep banging!

314
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,220
Oh!

315
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,426
What is it?

316
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,910
What is that?

317
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,305
- What? No, no! Don't break it.
- No. No, no, no!

318
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,706
Don't break it! Don't break it!
Don't break...

319
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,383
You broke it. Okay.

320
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,700
Wow. What?

321
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,550
- Oh, my God.
- What is that?

322
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,781
Yo, look, we all found these.

323
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,947
- If they're worth any money...
- No, he found them.

324
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,180
Now chill out.

325
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,307
- Chill out?
- Guys, guys, do you hear that?

326
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:05,268
Mine security. Peace.

327
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,785
Somebody should have pointed
that out. Wait, I did.

328
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,748
Billy!

329
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,583
- Wait, okay, okay.
- Run!

330
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,024
Billy! Just run to the... come on!

331
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,544
Billy, let's go!

332
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:17,110
- Haul ass, dude!
- I'm coming!

333
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,908
Are you kidding me?

334
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,065
Ja... Jason! Jason!

335
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,140
- What are you doing?
- You gotta open the doors!

336
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,340
Open the door!

337
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,547
- Yes, okay, just get in.
- What are you doing?

338
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:29,984
Did you see them? Are they down the road?

339
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,100
- I don't know.
- Okay.

340
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,540
Okay, what about the others?

341
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:37,065
- You gonna leave the others?
- Hold on.

342
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:41,541
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Jason!

343
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,628
Whoo!

344
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,383
- Oh, my mom's gonna kill me.
- Stop right there!

345
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,668
- Shit! Put your seat belt on.
- I got my seat belt on!

346
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,503
- Jason! Somebody's gonna die.
- Whoa!

347
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,343
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoo-hoo!

348
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,744
Whoa!

349
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,430
- There they are!
- Okay, so...

350
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,183
- Up the hill. Come on!
- Get 'em!

351
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,505
Okay!

352
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,422
- Okay, you drive.
- No, I... I really don't drive.

353
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:11,981
Okay, then really don't drive,
so I can pull them in.

354
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,624
I don't drive!

355
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,110
Get your foot!

356
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,829
- I got it.
- Wait, it says that the door's open.

357
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:18,663
That's because it's open, Billy.

358
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,424
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

359
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,788
- Go, go, go!
- Okay. Okay.

360
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,021
There they are! Get closer to them.

361
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,100
Get in!

362
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,186
Gotcha.

363
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,386
- I gotcha!
- I'm in!

364
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,630
What about the other guy?

365
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,549
- Just go!
- Go! Go!

366
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,349
Billy, look out!

367
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,503
Let's go downhill! Go to the lights below!

368
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,944
- You wanna drive now?
- Keep going, Billy,

369
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:52,226
- we're almost there.
- Guys! Guys, there's a train.

370
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,903
We got it.

371
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:00,700
Okay.

372
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,110
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

373
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,624
Hey!

374
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,700
Hey, what do you want me to do?

375
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,105
- Hey!
- Keep going! I'll pull him in!

376
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,943
Okay.

377
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,980
Are you crazy?

378
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,550
Yeah, I am.

379
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,704
Yo, it's catching up.

380
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,267
Look, there's the railroad crossing.
That's the way out, Billy.

381
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,659
- You got it.
- You got it!

382
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,945
I hope he has it.

383
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:32,386
- He definitely doesn't have it.
- I got it! I got it!

384
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:06,383
Storm's turned. It's gotten bad.
We're getting out of here.

385
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:13,030
Let's go!

386
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,669
Let's go!

387
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:16,940
Pull it port!

388
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:21,108
Pull up the net!

389
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:23,261
Let's go, boys! Pull!

390
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,069
A little more starboard!

391
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:27,267
Let her go!

392
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:32,940
What the hell is that?

393
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,908
Get back!

394
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,100
- Wide to the port!...now!
- Yeah!

395
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:27,305
Okay.

396
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:35,860
Billy! What's happening down there?

397
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,140
What?

398
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,267
- Where's your bodyguard?
- What are you doing?

399
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:51,707
I'm just gonna quietly snap your wrist,
you little bitch.

400
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,301
Oh, no, no, no. Oh... Okay.

401
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:09,859
Billy Cranston

402
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,744
just knocked Colt Wallace
out cold! Damn, Billy!

403
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,702
What happened? What happened?

404
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,822
- I didn't see it!
- Hi, Billy.

405
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,381
Hey. Come on, come on.

406
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:26,705
- Am I crazy or this is crazy, right?
- It's crazy.

407
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,861
We got hit by a train
and we're standing here.

408
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:29,986
How is that possible?

409
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:32,824
I don't remember getting home
from the mine at all.

410
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,708
I slept all day yesterday.

411
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,309
We gotta find Billy.

412
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:40,144
You know I wasn't trying to start
any trouble or anything like that.

413
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,660
And I say, "Hey, man, look,
I'm not a violent person.

414
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:45,390
But if you must come at me,
come at me, bro."

415
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:46,460
- Sweet!
- Yeah!

416
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,223
Boom! Down goes douchebag.

417
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:51,030
- Down goes... I... I can't say that word.
- Billy.

418
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:55,266
Hey, Kimberly... Kimberly Hart.

419
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,750
We need to talk.

420
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,628
How... what?

421
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,459
- Since when does he know Kimberly Hart?
- Billy's awesome.

422
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,150
Nice hair.

423
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,023
- Billy, look at me.
- Huh?

424
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,590
Do you feel weird?

425
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:14,662
You mean like weirder than usual?

426
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,821
Yeah. Different.

427
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:17,946
Oh.

428
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:24,301
Listen, we know something
happened up there, okay?

429
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,426
I'm not the same.

430
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,739
Me either. Oh! I'm strong.

431
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:29,220
- How strong?
- Like, insanely strong.

432
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:32,303
I feel like we need to go back up there.

433
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:38,945
The counter's boiling.

434
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,110
We're going back today.

435
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,180
Yeah.

436
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:03,221
Come on up.

437
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:06,381
Oh, she's down here.

438
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,699
So you're sure it's a woman?

439
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:11,830
Not a great-looking woman.
Come see for yourself.

440
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:15,425
Oh, that smell is... it's intense.

441
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,990
You should make a note of that.

442
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:20,142
Smell inside an old fishing boat
that holds tons of dead fish

443
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,664
doesn't smell so good.

444
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:22,780
Freaky, right?

445
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,190
- Look, do you need us?
- No.

446
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,784
All right, 'cause I need to get to bed.

447
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:29,624
Lock up when you're done.
There's beers in the fridge.

448
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,859
Jesus.

449
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,260
Jesus.

450
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,659
Unit two, this is Meinen.

451
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,707
I have a body. A deceased female.

452
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:15,063
Let's just keep going.

453
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:21,190
Guys, look. Look, it's that guy again.

454
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,784
Find anything interesting?

455
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,588
If I do, I'm keeping it!

456
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:27,707
- We know why you're here.
- Oh, yeah?

457
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:32,665
You guys wake up surprised to be alive
and jump over a house?

458
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:35,345
Yeah. Kinda. Well... no.

459
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:37,581
Look, we're different, all right?
Everything's different.

460
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,468
Uh, you're Zack, right?

461
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:41,030
Yup.

462
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:43,102
You still go to Angel Grove?

463
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,943
Ha! Sometimes!

464
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:49,228
You know, the other girl was here too,
about an hour ago.

465
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:51,745
Hey, you mean that girl right there?

466
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,344
Hey! Come on down!

467
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:56,150
We should figure this out together!

468
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:02,503
- Whoa.
- Oh, screw this.

469
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,263
- Okay, let me handle this.
- She got up there pretty fast.

470
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,427
No, no, no!

471
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,949
Yo, keep up.

472
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,740
Stop!

473
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,024
Just... just talk to me.

474
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,543
You have a coin. We have a coin.

475
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:37,139
We should just talk about this.
I mean, we don't know what this...

476
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,261
- Whoa! Whoa!
- What is wrong with you?

477
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,460
Whoa.

478
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:48,146
Oh, you're crazy! But so am I.

479
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,863
- Whoa, Zack.
- No, I got this.

480
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:51,066
- Wait, wait.
- No, I got this.

481
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,823
- What are you doing?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

482
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:05,583
Hey!

483
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:08,060
- I got her!
- Get off of me.

484
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,300
Just jump over.

485
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:11,382
Let's go. Jump with me. Yeah.

486
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,586
- No, no, no! Don't... don't jump.
- Okay.

487
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:14,463
- Don't jump. Don't jump.
- I'm gonna jump across with her,

488
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,870
and then you jump, okay?

489
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:16,986
- Piece o' cake.
- No, no, no!

490
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,266
Don't, don't! Jason! Hey!

491
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,182
That's not a piece o' cake!

492
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,548
- You all right?
- Yeah, no problem.

493
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,270
You got this, Billy!

494
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,625
No, I don't!

495
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:40,066
- It's fun.
- It's such a far jump.

496
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:41,140
- Come on, let's go, dude.
- Billy, come on.

497
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:44,069
- We all did it.
- Yeah, you'll be fine, I promise. Just jump.

498
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,220
Come on, do it, dude. Let's go.

499
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:48,464
The drop is probably more than
100 feet, which means death is imminent.

500
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,621
Okay, so if you die, Billy,
what's gonna happen?

501
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:51,985
Okay, your mom'll be alone.

502
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,868
But it's okay 'cause
she could find somebody else.

503
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,179
But she couldn't, 'cause you love your mom

504
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,465
- and you won't really...
- He's scared.

505
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,540
He'll come across, he's fine.

506
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,150
Okay. Okay.

507
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:01,301
Visualize jumping across!

508
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:02,983
- And then do it!
- Come on, you got this!

509
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,299
Okay!

510
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,460
Billy, you got this!

511
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,665
Whoa! Oh, shit!

512
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:17,979
Whoa!

513
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:20,745
- Are you okay?
- I got it.

514
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:21,820
- Come on, climb up. Climb up.
- I did it.

515
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:22,946
- Billy, you got it.
- I did it!

516
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,868
See, what'd we tell you, Billy?
You got it!

517
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:26,344
Told you. See?

518
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:27,830
- Whoo!
- Yes!

519
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:29,509
Billy, right! Yeah!

520
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:30,944
- Whoa!
- Billy!

521
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,020
- Oh, my God!
- Billy!

522
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:34,625
Billy!

523
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:36,343
Billy!

524
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:38,501
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Billy!

525
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,706
- We just kill that dude?
- What do we do?

526
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,828
No, no, no, no, no, no.

527
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:47,630
Hey, guys, you gotta come down here!

528
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,429
It's water! You gotta see this!

529
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:55,989
Yo, all right!
I'll see you guys down there.

530
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,550
Uh... bring that crazy girl.

531
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:03,504
Come on, you guys, let's go! Whoo!

532
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:04,626
Whoa!

533
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:14,544
Uh, hey... could I get a sip
of your water?

534
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,620
I'm dying.

535
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:22,707
Okay. Just don't finish it.

536
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:25,180
Thanks. And I'm really sorry.

537
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:27,023
Sorry for what?

538
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,226
Whoa!

539
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,742
Yeah!

540
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,468
Welcome to the club!

541
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,502
'Sup, crazy girl?

542
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:51,389
We gotta do that again.

543
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,300
Oh, thank goodness.

544
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:59,942
- Hey, guys. Guys!
- What?

545
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,783
- Check out how we glow.
- Cool.

546
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:04,226
- Oh, yeah!
- I like this.

547
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:06,142
I'm blue!

548
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,744
That's not my favorite color,
but it's cool.

549
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:09,786
I'm black!

550
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,463
- What?
- I am.

551
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,507
No, you're not.

552
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:28,064
Hey, guys. There's something down there.
Follow me.

553
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:00,062
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

554
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,789
Jason, I'm sliding!

555
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:12,149
- Hi.
- Again?

556
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,707
Well, that is unusual.

557
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:24,626
This just gets better and better.

558
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:26,666
Do you feel that?

559
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:31,583
There's something out here.

560
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,309
The walls are shaking.

561
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:35,620
Come on.

562
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,584
That's impossible.

563
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:17,464
This must have been here
for millions of years.

564
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:20,145
I mean, look how the rock
has grown around it.

565
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:23,219
I don't like this place.

566
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,786
Hey, guys.

567
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,704
Check it out.

568
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:44,022
- Okay.
- Okay.

569
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:57,347
- Holy sh...
- Shh!

570
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:00,787
- What? Think there's aliens in here?
- Just be quiet, Zack.

571
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,549
It's so cold in here.

572
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,309
Jason, is this real?

573
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:08,347
Like, are we really in a spaceship
right now?

574
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:10,740
I think so. Just... just breathe, okay?

575
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:11,900
Okay.

576
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:15,586
Hey. We've all seen enough.
Right? We should go now?

577
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:17,309
What? We're gonna be famous!

578
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:19,461
- What is wrong with you?
- Quiet!

579
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:22,189
There's something here.

580
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:28,348
Whoa!

581
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,420
- Ah!
- What was that?

582
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,060
Whoa.

583
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:37,946
What's going on?

584
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,663
- The stairs!
- Oh, my God!

585
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,025
There's no way out.

586
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:43,989
- Guys, guys, guys!
- Let's go! That way! Let's go! Let's go!

587
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:45,868
- I'm going!
- Run!

588
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:57,830
Come on, come on.

589
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,070
Didi, I'm coming!

590
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:16,670
You're real!

591
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:19,265
Leave her alone!

592
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:23,186
We will kill you.

593
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:24,829
Kill me? How?

594
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:27,020
There's five of us.

595
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,339
Yes, I know! I've been waiting for you.

596
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:32,060
Wait, where's the other guy?
One, two, three, four... oh! There he is.

597
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:34,426
Oh, no, no, no!

598
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,864
All of you.

599
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:41,943
In a spaceship buried underground?
How long have you been waiting?

600
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:44,226
- What's today? Monday?
- Yeah.

601
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:45,869
Then 65 million years.

602
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:49,102
I've been very lonely.

603
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:53,309
You're all so young-looking.

604
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:55,063
This has to do with the coins?

605
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,306
Yes, yes, the coins!

606
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:57,506
Different colors. Different kids.

607
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,263
Different-colored kids!

608
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,387
I'm so excited you're here!

609
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,346
Turn around.

610
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,345
Go on.

611
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,270
No way.

612
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,389
Proceed.

613
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:19,143
Think this'll work.

614
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:21,381
One, two, three, four, five.
Different colors.

615
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:24,542
Guys, let's focus on getting out of here.

616
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:26,542
Stay together,
and then when we see a chance...

617
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:29,782
- We run like hell.
- Okay. And if we don't get a chance?

618
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:31,020
Then we kill it.

619
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:35,350
Shouldn't hurt, but let's see.

620
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:37,149
Please, step into the footprints.

621
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:38,346
No. We are not going to do that.

622
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,820
Hey, question. Um, what are you?

623
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:44,142
I'm Alpha 5,
an alphormic lorcaid persona android.

624
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:46,745
- What? Yeah, I know.
- He said he's a Alpha 5...

625
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:50,506
I'm a talking robot. You can trust me.

626
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:55,306
Billy!

627
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:08,504
What the hell?

628
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:14,625
Okay.

629
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:22,864
Why do you keep looking at each other?

630
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:24,384
Is that, like, a human thing?

631
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:25,540
Fascinating.

632
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:46,703
Oh, it's working!
This is great! It's working!

633
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,270
Zordon, are you there? Zordon!

634
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:03,340
Okay. Okay.

635
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:11,467
Come on! Let's go! Move!

636
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:16,946
Go, go, go!

637
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:27,507
Come forward, please!

638
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:29,547
Do we have a choice?

639
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:30,859
Don't think so.

640
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:40,306
Look! It's Zordon!

641
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:41,665
What?

642
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:44,629
Zordon, they don't know who you are.

643
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:46,190
Come in! Come in!

644
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:48,830
These are them? They're so small.

645
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:50,629
Funny, I said the same thing, actually.

646
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:53,145
You mean to tell me
that the fate of the universe

647
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:56,029
is placed in the hands
of these... these children?

648
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,341
The universe? That's a big place.

649
00:44:58,430 --> 00:44:59,910
They're teenagers.

650
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:02,221
Somewhere between infancy
and full maturity.

651
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:05,428
- It's hard to explain, really. I don't...
- Show me the coins.

652
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,981
The morphing grid is never wrong.

653
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:12,949
If the power coins
have returned to the ship with these...

654
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:14,020
Teenagers!

655
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:15,829
With these teenagers,

656
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:19,381
then these teenagers
are the Power Rangers.

657
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:20,745
Power Rangers!

658
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:23,420
What?

659
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:25,627
Okay, quick question.

660
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:27,508
Hello. Hate to interrupt.

661
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:30,150
Did I just hear you say
we're Power Rangers?

662
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:33,621
Yes. Yes. You are the Power Rangers.

663
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:34,985
Any other questions?

664
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:36,868
- No, I think I'm good.
- Good.

665
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:39,909
I got a question. Um... Hi, how you doing?

666
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:42,824
Oh, okay... um, my name is Billy.
Billy Cranston.

667
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:46,699
- Kids used to call me Billy Crams-tons...
- Billy! Stop.

668
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:50,545
I'm sorry.
Uh... the images here in this sphere

669
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:52,701
tell a history of the Power Rangers.

670
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:56,625
Looks like the Power Rangers
were a team that protected life.

671
00:45:56,710 --> 00:46:00,340
And life is a bright light.
Or... a piece of light?

672
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:02,501
Yes. Yes, very good, Billy.

673
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:04,309
It is called the Zeo Crystal.

674
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:05,904
Oh, I love this part. This is good.

675
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:08,630
And every planet
in the universe that has life

676
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:11,020
has a piece of the crystal
buried inside it.

677
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:12,339
Sixty-five million years ago,

678
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:16,902
Zordon's team died defending the crystal
here in what is now Angel Grove.

679
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:19,505
- The coins have chosen you five.
- Yes! I knew it!

680
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:24,426
Now you must protect the Zeo Crystal
and life on earth.

681
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:27,230
Because... we... are the Power Rangers?

682
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:29,188
He's smart!

683
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:31,626
I'm sorry, um, is this some kind of joke?

684
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:33,588
Like, I'm standing here with a wet wedgie.

685
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:35,980
My socks are soaked.
We're squishing around in here.

686
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:37,789
We're talking to a wall. I mean, guys...

687
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:39,827
Silence!

688
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:05,900
Dig! Dig, Goldar!

689
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:35,146
Sir, I'm detecting elevated heart rates.

690
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:37,062
They're... they're very scared.

691
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:38,709
I don't understand.

692
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:40,429
Why would you show us that nightmare?

693
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:42,581
It's not a nightmare. It's the future.

694
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:44,627
- Was that for real?
- Felt like it.

695
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:47,589
- And who was that woman?
- Her name is Rita Repulsa.

696
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:49,542
She will create Goldar,

697
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:52,742
a huge monster who will rip the crystal
from the earth,

698
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:55,789
and all life on your planet will die.

699
00:47:55,870 --> 00:48:00,228
With the crystal, Rita will have the power
to create and destroy worlds.

700
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:02,427
So, let me guess.

701
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:05,230
You want us to kill this woman? R... Rita?

702
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:06,466
Ay, ay, ay! Rita!

703
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,950
She must be stopped.

704
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:09,589
When is she coming?

705
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:10,786
She's already here.

706
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:12,668
My best guess is we have 11 months.

707
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:15,948
Oh, I'm sorry, days. Days, 11 days.

708
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:18,301
If we're the Power Rangers
and this is our ship,

709
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:20,621
if I walk through that door right now,
will it open for me?

710
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:22,064
Yes, of course.

711
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:23,789
Let's go.

712
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:25,060
Whoa, what you doing?

713
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:28,029
No, no, no, come back!
No. No, please, don't leave.

714
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:32,184
Jason, my ranger team died
defending the crystal from Rita.

715
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:34,102
That's why I'm in this wall.

716
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:37,068
How'd you know my name?

717
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:40,348
Because it's you, Jason Scott.

718
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:44,749
You are the leader.
You are the Red Ranger.

719
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:51,187
Rita was a ranger, too. And my friend.

720
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:54,182
But she betrayed us.

721
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:56,387
Wanted more power.

722
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:57,745
She lost her way.

723
00:48:57,830 --> 00:49:02,143
Now she is just pure evil.

724
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:05,143
You must bring them back.
All of the rangers.

725
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:07,620
You must train your team to stop Rita

726
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:10,020
before she has the strength
to find the crystal.

727
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:13,023
Okay. I'm leaving.

728
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:17,343
- And I only speak for myself when I...
- No! You speak for all of them.

729
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:20,628
You know that, deep down,
what I'm saying is true.

730
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:22,542
You were born for this.

731
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:30,140
You all waited.

732
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:32,220
Even you.

733
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:35,382
Who... exactly are you?

734
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:37,223
Really? Now you're gonna ask me who I am?

735
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:39,302
- Look, her name is Didi.
- Trini.

736
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:41,541
She's new at school.
Transferred in a month ago.

737
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:42,746
We have English together, right?

738
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:44,742
I've been at Angel Grove
for over a year now.

739
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:47,345
We have biology together. Good talk.

740
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:49,069
Wait, look...

741
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:51,426
none of us really know each other, okay?

742
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:52,500
But somehow...

743
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:56,706
we were all in the same place at the
same time when Billy found those coins.

744
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:59,180
- And...
- Wait, wait, wait! Can I ask a question?

745
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:01,385
Are we really superheroes?

746
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:04,230
Like are we more like
Iron Man or Spider-Man?

747
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:07,059
'Cause I feel like I been bit by a spider,
but I feel really good, you know, not as...

748
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:10,461
All right, look, bro,
trust me, you're not a superhero.

749
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:12,542
Why are you talking to us
like you're the boss now?

750
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:15,702
Hey, hold up.
Can any of this Rita stuff be real?

751
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:17,144
Can any of it be true?

752
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:18,425
I don't know.

753
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:21,230
But I know that the answer
to what's wrong with us

754
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:23,222
and to what's happening to us...

755
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:25,425
is here.

756
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:30,541
So what are you saying?

757
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:32,349
I think we gotta come back.

758
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:35,024
I can't make you come back here.

759
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:39,150
But 4:00 tomorrow... I'll be here.

760
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:41,709
Hey, Jason, we don't... we don't...

761
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:45,790
- That makes sense. That makes sense.
- Of course.

762
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:48,903
I don't know why I didn't think
about that one in the first place.

763
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:33,429
So where were you today?

764
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:35,741
Were you with friends?
Do you have any friends?

765
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:37,503
- Why are you so tired...
- Okay, this is the problem.

766
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:39,582
You ask her four questions before
she's even answered the first.

767
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:43,141
Because she's like a ghost around here.
She needs to start communicating.

768
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:45,506
- June...
- Say something.

769
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:47,183
- Speak! I just...
- Relax.

770
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,262
Okay. Relax.

771
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:52,549
Okay, Trini, let's start over.

772
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:55,462
Please tell us one thing you did today.

773
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:01,787
Me and four kids from Angel Grove
found a spaceship buried underground.

774
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:03,099
What?

775
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:06,621
I'm pretty sure I'm a superhero.

776
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:09,185
Cool.

777
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:10,545
Not cool.

778
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:12,747
Pee in that cup!

779
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:20,379
This to remind me of my screw-up?

780
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:24,510
No. Wrecking yard
only offered me 300 bucks for it and...

781
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:29,625
you know, the frame's straight
and the engine still runs.

782
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:33,743
Figure I'd leave it up to you to decide
if you wanted to fix it.

783
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:41,304
Oh, shit.

784
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:46,622
Mr. Scott,
there's been an incident on your boat.

785
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:50,181
It's a terrible situation.
You gotta come with me.

786
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:53,547
A series of grisly crime
scenes has the sleepy fishing hamlet

787
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:55,622
of Angel Grove reeling.

788
00:52:56,830 --> 00:52:59,026
- Bodies were discovered...
- I'm building Goldar for you....

789
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:02,069
This rash of violence
has the town on edge.

790
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:10,105
Goldar's coming. Goldar's coming.

791
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:14,070
Goldar's coming. Goldar's coming.

792
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:15,630
What the hell you doing?

793
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:21,229
I need gold.
I will build my beautiful Goldar.

794
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:25,543
Goldar takes the Zeo Crystal.
I take the universe.

795
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:29,386
Me, too!

796
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:05,864
- What's up, crazy girl?
- Hey.

797
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:07,304
Shall we do this?

798
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:10,108
You need to follow the three rules

799
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:11,863
to being a Power Ranger.

800
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:14,590
You must never use your powers
for personal gain.

801
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:18,903
You must never escalate a fight,
unless your enemy forces you to.

802
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:22,267
And you must never reveal
your identity. Ever.

803
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:25,502
To assume your ranger identities,
you need to morph.

804
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:27,661
Have any of you morphed before?

805
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:30,822
Yes. But only in the shower.

806
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:33,744
Okay, okay. Let's step
into the footprints, please.

807
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:35,105
Let's try this.

808
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:39,943
Standing in this circle as a team,

809
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:42,067
you can easily connect
to the morphing grid.

810
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:44,062
- Do you feel it?
- Yeah, they do.

811
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:46,062
No. Not feeling it.

812
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:48,221
You need to morph to get your armor.

813
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:51,667
I knew it! We do get armor.

814
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:54,026
Jason! We get armor! Oh, we get armor.

815
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:56,341
Cool. When do you give us the armor?

816
00:54:56,470 --> 00:54:58,780
You already have it inside of you.

817
00:54:58,870 --> 00:55:02,701
You bring it out by connecting to each
other and connecting to the morphing grid.

818
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:06,420
Clear your minds and focus.

819
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:11,665
Power Rangers were a legion of warriors
sworn to protect life.

820
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:12,786
Yes!

821
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:15,510
You must become those warriors.

822
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:17,229
Become the warriors!

823
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:27,501
What?

824
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:29,468
What? What, did it... did it work?

825
00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:31,382
Alpha 5, why didn't they morph?

826
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:34,907
Yeah, I don't... I don't know, sir.
It's... it's disturbing.

827
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:37,141
Very disturbing.
This might take some time.

828
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:38,505
We don't have time.

829
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:41,344
If they can't morph,
what are we supposed to do?

830
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:42,750
They'll have to train without armor.

831
00:55:42,830 --> 00:55:46,426
- They need to prepare.
- Without armor?

832
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:47,705
Sir, that'll be very painful.

833
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:49,349
Take them down to the pit.

834
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:53,590
All right, follow me.
We're going to the pit!

835
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:55,502
Jason, I don't wanna find out
what the pit is.

836
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:58,469
So this is the pit. It's nice, right?

837
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:00,382
Alpha 5, begin the exercise.

838
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:01,950
Uh... sorry, guys.

839
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:03,942
- What exercise?
- Chill out, dude.

840
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:10,746
These creatures before you

841
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:12,503
are a simulation of Rita's army.

842
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:13,905
They're called Putties.

843
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:16,300
You must get through them to get to her.

844
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:17,619
No, no, no, no, Jason.

845
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:20,862
Cool. Look, relax, guys. It's a hologram.

846
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:22,862
Like a video game. Look.

847
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:24,543
Whoa!

848
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:26,701
That's a strong-ass hologram.

849
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:29,869
Not a video game.

850
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:32,545
This is why you must morph
into your armor.

851
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:35,543
If Rita becomes strong enough
to build her army,

852
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:37,781
it'll be the beginning of the end.

853
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:40,305
Rangers, welcome to training.

854
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:42,109
I'm so excited you guys are back.

855
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:44,659
Aim for the center mass.

856
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:45,900
One more time.

857
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:47,947
Come on, duck the punches.
Find their weak side.

858
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:50,147
Oh...

859
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:52,506
Let's go a couple o' hits, okay?
Hit one...

860
00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:53,626
No, let's try it again.

861
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:54,860
Now this is exciting.

862
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:57,666
Yeah, Trini!

863
00:56:59,310 --> 00:57:00,505
Hai!

864
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:01,626
Ready, master Billy?

865
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:05,945
You need to learn the element of surprise.

866
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:08,147
Ready? Let's go again.

867
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:10,023
All right, Billy, lighter on your feet.

868
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:12,740
Hands up.

869
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:25,625
Play with some energy now! Let's go!

870
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:32,465
Focus! Focus! Everybody just focus!

871
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:37,106
Lucky shot.

872
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:41,507
You guys all know
you could be murdered, right?

873
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:56,546
No.

874
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:04,184
You must shed
your masks to wear this armor.

875
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:06,739
I don't feel anything.

876
00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:09,823
Take them down to the pit.

877
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:11,139
Now watch me...

878
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:14,268
slip, grab, lift.

879
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:15,340
Yeah!

880
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:17,626
Slip, grab, lift!

881
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:20,660
Yes!

882
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:42,150
Think only of each other,

883
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:44,187
and the morphing grid will open to you.

884
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:46,465
Is it working?

885
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:47,700
No, it's not.

886
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:49,190
Come on! Try harder!

887
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:51,790
Let's just concentrate.

888
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:53,623
I've been concentrating though, Jason.

889
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:56,420
'Cause we haven't been concentrating...
all we need to do is just concentrate.

890
00:58:56,510 --> 00:58:57,944
Don't tell me to concentrate.

891
00:58:58,030 --> 00:58:59,146
Just follow my lead.

892
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:00,346
Let's not fight with each other.

893
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:02,103
Zack, now is not the time.

894
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:07,221
Come on. Let's go train.

895
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:10,508
The information we need to triangulate

896
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:13,867
the location of the crystal
was lost in the battle. So...

897
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:15,669
Billy, are you listening to me?

898
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:16,740
Billy, what are you doing?

899
00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:19,186
Billy!

900
00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:23,105
Where's the crystal?
Find it, Billy, find it.

901
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:24,909
Where's the crystal?

902
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:26,180
There.

903
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:29,422
One, two... Okay, 17 degrees north...

904
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:31,502
Hey, idiot, watch where you're going!

905
00:59:31,590 --> 00:59:32,865
- One, two, three...
- Wake up!

906
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:44,222
Two fishermen were laid
to rest today at Saint Andrew's Cemetery.

907
00:59:44,310 --> 00:59:47,109
Residents of Angel Grove
are feeling the shock.

908
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:49,659
Fear has the town on edge.

909
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:52,265
This series of murders has police baffled

910
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:55,747
as police have linked the loss of gold
to each crime scene.

911
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:58,743
What is now being dubbed
"Angel Grove's Gold Killer"

912
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:00,059
is still on the loose.

913
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:04,184
...Rita manages to create Goldar...
Are you listening to me?

914
01:00:04,270 --> 01:00:06,262
And he rips the crystal from the ground,

915
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:09,787
it'll be like 10,000 nuclear bombs
washing over Earth.

916
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:11,139
Supposed to freak us out?

917
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:13,347
You keep making this harder.
We're busting our asses.

918
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:15,069
Feel free to throw us a bone
at some point.

919
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:17,824
Yes, I see you busting your "asses."

920
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:20,470
So I've decided
to give you some inspiration.

921
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:24,908
What you will find beyond this wall
will forever change your lives.

922
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:26,219
Come on.

923
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:32,263
The Zords!

924
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:33,870
- Pretty cool, right?
- Yeah.

925
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:34,940
They take on the form

926
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:36,987
of the most powerful organism
on the planet.

927
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:41,189
When these Zords formed,
dinosaurs reigned supreme.

928
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:43,660
They will be an extension of you.

929
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:46,743
And their power... is all but limitless.

930
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:53,306
But you're not ready for this power.

931
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:54,380
When you morph,

932
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:57,269
your armor will make you one
with the Zords.

933
01:00:57,350 --> 01:00:59,228
So come on, let's go train.

934
01:00:59,310 --> 01:01:02,189
Today's the day you become rangers!
I can feel it!

935
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:07,020
- Okay.
- Let's go.

936
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:09,500
Yeah. Let's go.

937
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:18,140
This was a bad idea.

938
01:01:18,270 --> 01:01:20,546
Okay, okay, uh, signals, brakes.

939
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:21,780
Brakes, I need brakes!

940
01:01:21,870 --> 01:01:23,827
Manual. Man-u-al.

941
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:27,062
Where are the brakes... Alpha 5!

942
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:30,189
Ahh! Oh, crap!

943
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:32,626
Hey! Move! Move!

944
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:33,939
Out of the way!

945
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:39,381
@ Go tell it on the mountain @

946
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:45,230
You have to remember that in today's
training lesson the important thing is to...

947
01:01:45,310 --> 01:01:47,950
- Wait. Where's Zack?
- Seriously?

948
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:52,747
Run, run, run! Run!

949
01:01:54,030 --> 01:01:55,987
Run! Run!

950
01:01:57,550 --> 01:02:00,304
It's bad!

951
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:09,100
You all right?

952
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:13,343
Ay, ay, ay!

953
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:16,389
All right, my bad, my bad.
That's on me, right there.

954
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:17,790
What's your problem?

955
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:19,947
You could've killed yourself. Or us.

956
01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:21,589
- Back off, bossman.
- Hey!

957
01:02:22,590 --> 01:02:25,025
Oh, come on, guys. Wow.

958
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:26,544
- Guys, guys, guys, come on!
- Watch it!

959
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:28,263
Wait. What are you doing?

960
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:34,269
Just stop fighting, please!

961
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:44,425
What?

962
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:47,422
That's dope.

963
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:49,502
What? I got something on my f...

964
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:51,707
- Yeah!
- Whoa!

965
01:02:51,790 --> 01:02:54,624
Okay, now that's cool! Oh, yeah!

966
01:02:54,710 --> 01:02:56,110
- Hold still.
- Don't touch it. Zack, don't touch it.

967
01:02:56,190 --> 01:02:57,510
Zack, do not touch it.

968
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:00,670
Whoa!

969
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:02,946
Where'd it go? Bring it back.

970
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:05,181
Bring it back, dude.

971
01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:06,260
Get out.

972
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:09,422
Training is over for today. Go home.

973
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:11,866
I'm sorry, he just morphed.

974
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:13,270
He did it. You saw it, right?

975
01:03:13,350 --> 01:03:14,500
Do it again.

976
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:16,900
All of you. Any of you.

977
01:03:16,990 --> 01:03:20,381
- Billy. How'd you do it, Billy?
- Come on, Billy, let's do it.

978
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:21,984
- Show us what you did.
- Come on. Do it again.

979
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:28,229
- Do it again!
- I'm trying, I'm trying! I can't focus!

980
01:03:28,310 --> 01:03:31,348
Billy, how'd you do it? Show us.

981
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:34,703
Okay, we don't know how.

982
01:03:34,790 --> 01:03:36,224
That's what I thought.

983
01:03:36,310 --> 01:03:40,065
If you can't morph, you are not rangers.

984
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:42,346
Go home. All of you.

985
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:45,140
Now what?

986
01:03:45,230 --> 01:03:46,266
Damn.

987
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:48,103
Seriously?

988
01:03:55,510 --> 01:03:56,660
Hey, guys...

989
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:59,822
guys, look, uh...
I'ma stay up here tonight.

990
01:03:59,910 --> 01:04:04,109
Make a fire. I got some food
if you guys wanna stay.

991
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:06,825
I'm down.

992
01:04:08,270 --> 01:04:10,501
All right. Cool.

993
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:14,664
Jason's team is failing.
I shall destroy Rita myself.

994
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:17,470
There must be a way to free me
from this wall.

995
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:22,386
Yes, but the irony is,
is that you need these rangers to morph.

996
01:04:22,470 --> 01:04:24,462
If they morph, you can harness that energy

997
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:26,940
to regenerate your body
and come back through.

998
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:29,261
There's got to be another way! I can't...

999
01:04:29,350 --> 01:04:31,581
What, Zordon? You can't what?

1000
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:35,386
Wait for us dumb kids to morph
so that you can come back to life?

1001
01:04:35,470 --> 01:04:37,268
That's what all this
has been about, right?

1002
01:04:37,350 --> 01:04:39,023
You coming back?

1003
01:04:39,110 --> 01:04:42,148
This has only ever been
about protecting the crystal.

1004
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:44,142
Rita could be building Goldar as we speak.

1005
01:04:44,230 --> 01:04:47,826
- Don't underestimate me or my team.
- You can't stop him.

1006
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:53,030
She will have him dig up the crystal
and life on earth will die.

1007
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:54,140
And we need you.

1008
01:04:55,150 --> 01:04:57,267
Because you were so successful
at stopping her last time.

1009
01:04:57,350 --> 01:05:00,309
I died burying those coins

1010
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:03,747
in hopes that they would find
the next real rangers.

1011
01:05:03,870 --> 01:05:05,987
Those who are worthy.

1012
01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:07,823
Well, sorry to disappoint you.

1013
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:10,823
I don't need to stand here
and have you tell me what I did wrong.

1014
01:05:10,910 --> 01:05:15,826
- I can go home and get that.
- Jason, you need me out of this wall.

1015
01:05:15,910 --> 01:05:17,663
To help lead this team!

1016
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:19,867
Your team's dead.

1017
01:05:20,870 --> 01:05:23,101
And you're just as scared as we are.

1018
01:05:28,670 --> 01:05:32,903
These... are all 24 karat gold bands.

1019
01:05:32,990 --> 01:05:34,663
Hello, I'll be right with you.

1020
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:37,424
They're at the top of your budget...

1021
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:41,026
I'll get you anything you want.

1022
01:05:41,110 --> 01:05:43,944
Aw. You're so sweet.

1023
01:05:44,030 --> 01:05:45,749
Get my cookie anything she wants.

1024
01:05:48,310 --> 01:05:50,063
I'll be right back.

1025
01:05:52,830 --> 01:05:55,026
Uh... can I help you?

1026
01:05:56,470 --> 01:05:57,745
Gold.

1027
01:05:59,110 --> 01:06:00,942
I'm interested...

1028
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:02,020
in gold.

1029
01:06:03,070 --> 01:06:04,060
Yeah.

1030
01:06:09,390 --> 01:06:12,110
We have some very nice pieces here.

1031
01:06:25,710 --> 01:06:28,828
Come closer.

1032
01:06:28,910 --> 01:06:31,106
- Closer. Closer. Closer.
- Oh...

1033
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:40,981
- This. Give it to me!
- Of course!

1034
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:42,424
Okay. Here you go.

1035
01:06:46,150 --> 01:06:47,504
Ah...

1036
01:06:52,350 --> 01:06:53,340
Grow.

1037
01:06:54,830 --> 01:06:56,230
Grow.

1038
01:06:59,830 --> 01:07:00,900
More!

1039
01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:05,990
Police! Don't move!

1040
01:07:06,070 --> 01:07:09,620
Drop your... weapon,
and put your hands on your head.

1041
01:07:09,710 --> 01:07:10,746
Do it now!

1042
01:07:10,870 --> 01:07:12,463
Do what I say, lady!

1043
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:16,100
Lady... I like the sound of "lady."

1044
01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:17,909
Get on the ground and you won't get hurt.

1045
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:33,110
Unit five, I need backup
at Fenix Jewelers.

1046
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:35,705
Shots fired. I repeat, shots fired.

1047
01:07:37,110 --> 01:07:38,180
Get down!

1048
01:07:46,510 --> 01:07:50,220
It's been too long
since I raised my beautiful creatures.

1049
01:07:52,510 --> 01:07:54,706
Did you miss me?

1050
01:08:03,030 --> 01:08:04,623
Oh, my God.

1051
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:06,508
Kill him!

1052
01:08:10,590 --> 01:08:11,740
All right.

1053
01:08:11,830 --> 01:08:13,230
If I weren't stuck in this wall,

1054
01:08:13,350 --> 01:08:15,581
I would eat that junk food!

1055
01:08:17,790 --> 01:08:19,509
What happened back there?

1056
01:08:19,590 --> 01:08:21,468
Nothing. Don't worry about it.

1057
01:08:24,550 --> 01:08:26,143
Billy, how'd you do it?

1058
01:08:27,150 --> 01:08:28,504
How'd you morph?

1059
01:08:28,590 --> 01:08:30,263
I don't know.

1060
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:33,388
What are you guys thinking about
when we're trying to morph?

1061
01:08:33,470 --> 01:08:37,146
You must shed
your masks to wear this armor.

1062
01:08:39,910 --> 01:08:41,742
Think only of each other

1063
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:43,867
and the morphing grid will open to you.

1064
01:08:43,950 --> 01:08:45,020
Yeah, that's better.

1065
01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:49,030
Well, maybe it's because
we don't know each other.

1066
01:08:49,110 --> 01:08:50,749
Maybe that's why we can't morph.

1067
01:08:53,150 --> 01:08:54,504
Okay.

1068
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:57,901
No, I'm serious. Let's do this. For real.

1069
01:08:57,990 --> 01:08:59,549
- What?
- I'm Zack.

1070
01:08:59,630 --> 01:09:01,940
And I am a Power Ranger.

1071
01:09:04,190 --> 01:09:06,659
Hi, Zack.

1072
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:11,870
Truth: I live
in the Melody Mobile Home Park.

1073
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:13,185
It's just me and my mom.

1074
01:09:14,190 --> 01:09:15,863
And my mom?

1075
01:09:15,950 --> 01:09:17,828
My mom is the best!

1076
01:09:22,190 --> 01:09:24,102
But my mom, she's sick.

1077
01:09:25,110 --> 01:09:26,669
I do what I can, but...

1078
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:29,020
but I'm scared.

1079
01:09:30,190 --> 01:09:32,989
Sometimes I get too scared
to stay there at night, 'cause...

1080
01:09:34,190 --> 01:09:36,830
'cause I'm afraid she can't make it.

1081
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:40,303
And if she goes...

1082
01:09:42,230 --> 01:09:43,710
when she goes,

1083
01:09:45,190 --> 01:09:46,829
I got nobody else.

1084
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:55,861
Look, I think
being with you guys is good for me.

1085
01:09:58,310 --> 01:09:59,300
Let's do that.

1086
01:09:59,390 --> 01:10:01,461
Let's tell our secrets.
It'll... it'll help us.

1087
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:03,746
Okay, I got a secret.

1088
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:08,069
- I like country music.
- What?

1089
01:10:08,150 --> 01:10:09,869
No, matter of fact, I love country music.

1090
01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:13,505
And I don't...

1091
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:15,910
I don't miss my dad as much.

1092
01:10:18,710 --> 01:10:20,747
I mean, coming to the mine
with him was all I had.

1093
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:26,587
But coming to the mine
with you guys is just as good.

1094
01:10:26,670 --> 01:10:28,389
Yeah.

1095
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:30,701
Bigger secret is why
were you in detention?

1096
01:10:30,790 --> 01:10:32,827
- I blew up my lunchbox.
- What?

1097
01:10:32,910 --> 01:10:35,186
What, it was a accident, okay?

1098
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:38,104
- Of course.
- My lunchbox was in my locker.

1099
01:10:38,190 --> 01:10:40,580
Boom goes the lunchbox,
in detention goes Billy.

1100
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:44,584
But let's not forget that Kimberly Hart
was also in... in detention, too, so...

1101
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:48,945
Not tonight.

1102
01:10:50,110 --> 01:10:51,260
Skip me.

1103
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:55,620
What about you, dude?

1104
01:10:56,630 --> 01:10:58,781
Why don't you tell us who you really are?

1105
01:10:58,870 --> 01:11:01,180
Because everyone knows exactly who I am.

1106
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:03,745
Okay.

1107
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:04,946
What about you, crazy girl?

1108
01:11:05,030 --> 01:11:08,148
I could tell you anything
and you'd have to believe me.

1109
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:15,386
Okay, um...

1110
01:11:15,470 --> 01:11:18,622
I'm the new girl. Always.

1111
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:22,302
Three schools in three years.

1112
01:11:23,310 --> 01:11:27,509
What's crazy is I like it that way.
You know, it's just easier.

1113
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:30,025
Nobody ever has to get to know me and uh,

1114
01:11:30,110 --> 01:11:33,581
my parents don't have to worry
about my relationships.

1115
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:36,750
Boyfriend troubles?

1116
01:11:36,830 --> 01:11:40,824
Yeah. Boyfriend troubles.

1117
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:45,024
Girlfriend troubles?

1118
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:54,581
My family is so normal.

1119
01:11:54,670 --> 01:11:55,820
Too normal.

1120
01:11:59,030 --> 01:12:00,623
They believe in labels.

1121
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:07,547
They'd like for me to, um...
dress differently.

1122
01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:10,190
Talk more.

1123
01:12:12,150 --> 01:12:14,824
Have the kind of friends
they want me to have.

1124
01:12:16,710 --> 01:12:20,226
It's just... I don't know how to tell them
what's really going on with me.

1125
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:27,430
And I've never said any of this out loud.

1126
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:30,662
Well, it's cool. You're with us now.

1127
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:34,380
Am I?

1128
01:12:36,230 --> 01:12:37,550
What does that mean?

1129
01:12:37,630 --> 01:12:39,303
When all this is over.

1130
01:12:40,710 --> 01:12:42,463
Are we Power Rangers or...

1131
01:12:44,830 --> 01:12:46,503
are we friends?

1132
01:13:12,230 --> 01:13:13,903
Do you know who I am?

1133
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:17,264
Yes.

1134
01:13:18,590 --> 01:13:20,741
I was once just like you.

1135
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:24,345
So pretty.

1136
01:13:24,430 --> 01:13:26,865
Innocent.

1137
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:31,149
Are all the rangers on Zordon's new team
as young as you?

1138
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:34,344
Delightful!

1139
01:13:36,150 --> 01:13:37,789
Have you morphed yet?

1140
01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:41,789
Trick question.

1141
01:13:41,870 --> 01:13:43,987
If you could morph,

1142
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:48,223
we'd be having
a very different conversation.

1143
01:13:48,350 --> 01:13:52,663
Mmm. The Yellow Ranger.

1144
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:54,707
Should I kill you?

1145
01:13:54,790 --> 01:13:58,545
I killed the Yellow Ranger... before.

1146
01:13:58,630 --> 01:14:01,350
And I loved it!

1147
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:04,150
Oh, you want your armor.

1148
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:08,270
I'll show you mine, if you show me yours.

1149
01:14:23,110 --> 01:14:27,389
No, please, you're hurting me!
You're so strong!

1150
01:14:27,470 --> 01:14:30,747
I'm just kidding.

1151
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:34,825
You've got spunk, little Yellow.

1152
01:14:34,910 --> 01:14:36,424
I see myself in you.

1153
01:14:36,510 --> 01:14:40,424
I was an outsider on Zordon's
team just like you.

1154
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:45,301
All I need to know is,
where is the Zeo Crystal?

1155
01:14:45,390 --> 01:14:47,507
I don't know.

1156
01:14:48,510 --> 01:14:49,910
Sadly, I believe you.

1157
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:54,109
Tomorrow, I am going to destroy
Angel Grove.

1158
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:56,705
But, in exchange for your life,

1159
01:14:56,790 --> 01:15:00,864
you will find out where that crystal is,
and you will come to me.

1160
01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:02,589
We can have a little deal,

1161
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:04,707
Didi, my friend.

1162
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:19,627
- Shh! It's me.
- Kim.

1163
01:15:20,870 --> 01:15:22,463
How did you get in here?

1164
01:15:22,550 --> 01:15:25,668
I'm a superhero.
And you left your window open.

1165
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:27,230
Is everything okay?

1166
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:31,221
I think I'm the reason we can't morph.

1167
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:35,222
I haven't really been honest.

1168
01:15:35,310 --> 01:15:38,223
Okay. I punched Ty Fleming in the face

1169
01:15:38,310 --> 01:15:42,224
because he told everyone
I was the meanest person he'd ever met.

1170
01:15:42,310 --> 01:15:43,426
And he was right.

1171
01:15:43,550 --> 01:15:44,870
Well, that can't be true.

1172
01:15:44,950 --> 01:15:46,589
Okay.

1173
01:15:48,030 --> 01:15:49,828
Whoa.

1174
01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:52,061
- You took that picture?
- No.

1175
01:15:52,150 --> 01:15:55,348
Amanda Clark took that picture.
Of herself.

1176
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:59,663
But she shared it with me.
Privately. She trusted me.

1177
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:02,185
And you sent that pic to... to Ty?

1178
01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:04,785
With a text that said,

1179
01:16:04,870 --> 01:16:06,782
"Is this the girl you wanna
bring home to your mom?"

1180
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:08,384
Oh.

1181
01:16:08,470 --> 01:16:11,622
I didn't realize how mean
it was until I saw her face.

1182
01:16:11,710 --> 01:16:14,828
Kim, there's literally thousands of photos
going around school.

1183
01:16:14,910 --> 01:16:18,950
I don't care about them.
I care about this. I did this.

1184
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:21,864
I had to sit in Mr. Detmer's
office with Amanda's father

1185
01:16:21,950 --> 01:16:24,943
and watch as they showed him
that photo of his daughter.

1186
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:30,626
In his eyes, for the first time,
I could see who I'd become.

1187
01:16:30,710 --> 01:16:34,465
You know, so I lied.
I blamed everyone else.

1188
01:16:35,630 --> 01:16:37,508
I wanted to die, that's why...

1189
01:16:37,590 --> 01:16:40,628
that's why when you asked me to run away,
I was ready.

1190
01:16:40,710 --> 01:16:44,624
Okay, listen. Start over.
Erase that picture right now.

1191
01:16:44,710 --> 01:16:47,623
- Jason, it can't be erased.
- Then live with it.

1192
01:16:47,710 --> 01:16:50,350
You did an awful thing.
It doesn't make you an awful person.

1193
01:16:54,950 --> 01:16:57,101
Just be the person you wanna be.

1194
01:17:07,870 --> 01:17:10,465
So, we all got the same text.
So where is she?

1195
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:14,990
I'm here.

1196
01:17:16,990 --> 01:17:19,869
Look, Rita came to my house tonight.

1197
01:17:19,950 --> 01:17:21,589
- What?
- Yeah. She's real...

1198
01:17:22,790 --> 01:17:24,429
insane.

1199
01:17:24,510 --> 01:17:26,263
She nearly killed me.

1200
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:28,819
She was trying to get me to join her.

1201
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:31,061
She said she'd spare my life,
if I could keep a secret.

1202
01:17:31,150 --> 01:17:32,140
What secret?

1203
01:17:32,230 --> 01:17:35,348
At dawn, the destruction
of Angel Grove begins.

1204
01:17:35,430 --> 01:17:37,547
This is real. This is the end.

1205
01:17:37,630 --> 01:17:38,780
No, it's not. Where is she?

1206
01:17:38,870 --> 01:17:40,941
She said to meet her
where the dead ships live.

1207
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:43,864
Okay. That's the boatyard
by the docks, right?

1208
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:44,986
- Let's go.
- What?

1209
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:52,746
Are you serious? No one?

1210
01:17:52,830 --> 01:17:54,549
Jason, we're not even Power Rangers yet.

1211
01:17:54,630 --> 01:17:56,269
I say we go back to Zordon.

1212
01:17:56,390 --> 01:18:00,100
Okay, the only reason Zordon
wanted us to become Power Rangers

1213
01:18:00,190 --> 01:18:01,909
is so that he can come back to life.

1214
01:18:01,990 --> 01:18:03,106
What makes you say that?

1215
01:18:03,230 --> 01:18:04,789
Because he told me.

1216
01:18:04,870 --> 01:18:06,509
Wait, so this all is a lie?

1217
01:18:06,590 --> 01:18:08,388
Of course it was a lie, Billy.

1218
01:18:08,470 --> 01:18:09,699
We failed.

1219
01:18:09,790 --> 01:18:13,670
Let's stop being delusional
about being a team of superheroes.

1220
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:16,219
We're all screw-ups.

1221
01:18:16,310 --> 01:18:19,621
And as much as I hate this scrubby,
bullshit town,

1222
01:18:19,710 --> 01:18:22,828
I don't wanna just sit around
and watch it die, okay?

1223
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:26,630
Let's go and do the one thing
that's been asked of us

1224
01:18:26,710 --> 01:18:28,064
and kill Rita.

1225
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:34,219
You know this is a really bad idea, right?

1226
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:35,664
The worst.

1227
01:18:36,830 --> 01:18:39,504
Let's vote. Show of hands.

1228
01:18:56,110 --> 01:18:57,385
Let's do it.

1229
01:19:27,030 --> 01:19:30,990
Okay. Okay, let's go.

1230
01:19:33,790 --> 01:19:35,224
Take the left, I'll take the right.

1231
01:19:35,310 --> 01:19:36,790
Okay. Got it.

1232
01:19:42,230 --> 01:19:43,983
- We'll, untie him. Hold this.
- No, no, no.

1233
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:46,380
Let's just think about this, okay?

1234
01:19:46,470 --> 01:19:47,699
Oh, shit!

1235
01:19:52,430 --> 01:19:54,342
Right on time.

1236
01:19:55,350 --> 01:19:57,546
I was beginning to think you were too dumb

1237
01:19:57,630 --> 01:19:59,861
to know where the dead ships live.

1238
01:20:02,150 --> 01:20:03,379
Let's play.

1239
01:20:29,150 --> 01:20:33,906
Five little rangers tied up like fish.

1240
01:20:35,550 --> 01:20:40,261
The leader? Oh, hello, Red.

1241
01:20:40,350 --> 01:20:42,819
Oh!

1242
01:20:42,910 --> 01:20:45,425
You're not entirely disappointing.

1243
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:49,345
Oh, look at you.
Trying to figure out my plan.

1244
01:20:49,430 --> 01:20:50,625
I'll just tell you.

1245
01:20:50,710 --> 01:20:54,101
Yellow has led you to your deaths.

1246
01:20:54,190 --> 01:20:56,830
Because I'm going to kill you,

1247
01:20:57,830 --> 01:21:02,063
one by one, until you tell me,

1248
01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:03,664
where is my crystal?

1249
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:05,104
We don't know.

1250
01:21:05,190 --> 01:21:08,342
No, Red. You don't know!

1251
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:10,308
But guess what?

1252
01:21:10,390 --> 01:21:12,222
One of you does.

1253
01:21:13,230 --> 01:21:15,062
Who could it be?

1254
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:17,745
Eenie, meenie, miney...

1255
01:21:18,870 --> 01:21:20,065
Blue.

1256
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:24,982
Blue, so loyal.

1257
01:21:25,070 --> 01:21:26,220
Pure of heart.

1258
01:21:26,350 --> 01:21:29,422
Tell the class what you know!

1259
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:31,979
Where's my crystal?

1260
01:21:33,710 --> 01:21:36,464
You can tell me now, Blue,

1261
01:21:36,550 --> 01:21:40,544
or you can tell me after I kill
all of your friends.

1262
01:21:42,190 --> 01:21:44,500
Let's start with Black.

1263
01:21:44,590 --> 01:21:46,661
No! Stop!

1264
01:21:46,750 --> 01:21:47,786
No.

1265
01:21:49,110 --> 01:21:52,945
He dies in three, two...

1266
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:55,669
Okay! Okay!

1267
01:21:57,110 --> 01:21:58,180
Don't hurt my friends, all right?

1268
01:21:58,270 --> 01:22:00,227
It's at a dining establishment.

1269
01:22:00,310 --> 01:22:02,870
Where? What does that mean?
What's it called?

1270
01:22:03,950 --> 01:22:05,179
It's a Krispy Kreme.

1271
01:22:05,270 --> 01:22:07,944
- Krispy Kreme?
- Krispy Kreme.

1272
01:22:08,030 --> 01:22:09,305
This is a special place?

1273
01:22:09,390 --> 01:22:11,666
- Very special.
- It must be.

1274
01:22:11,750 --> 01:22:14,265
The source of life itself is buried there.

1275
01:22:14,350 --> 01:22:17,900
Thank you, Blue, for being so weak.

1276
01:22:17,990 --> 01:22:22,223
Zordon would lose all respect
for me if I don't kill you.

1277
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:24,142
- At least one of you.
- What?

1278
01:22:26,110 --> 01:22:27,703
No! Billy!

1279
01:22:31,350 --> 01:22:32,579
- Billy!
- Billy!

1280
01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:35,663
- Jason, we gotta help him!
- Billy! Billy!

1281
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:41,708
You're not ready to kill me.

1282
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:44,946
Ha! You're not worthy.

1283
01:22:47,870 --> 01:22:49,509
Quick! Get the rope!

1284
01:22:54,350 --> 01:22:55,340
Billy!

1285
01:23:04,070 --> 01:23:05,060
Billy?

1286
01:23:05,150 --> 01:23:06,345
He's gonna be okay, right?

1287
01:23:07,870 --> 01:23:09,270
Come on.

1288
01:23:09,350 --> 01:23:12,502
Hey, hey. You got this, big guy. Come on.

1289
01:23:14,190 --> 01:23:15,419
He's dead.

1290
01:23:24,270 --> 01:23:25,624
He's dead.

1291
01:23:25,710 --> 01:23:26,939
No.

1292
01:23:44,070 --> 01:23:45,345
Pick him up.

1293
01:23:47,070 --> 01:23:48,789
Help me pick him up!

1294
01:23:51,390 --> 01:23:52,540
Come on!

1295
01:24:15,990 --> 01:24:20,940
Okay. Okay. Come on, Billy.
We got you, buddy.

1296
01:24:21,030 --> 01:24:22,987
Take him. Take him.

1297
01:24:24,590 --> 01:24:25,706
Yeah.

1298
01:24:46,030 --> 01:24:47,862
- Let's just put him down.
- Okay.

1299
01:24:48,870 --> 01:24:50,862
- Slow, slow, slow.
- Master Billy.

1300
01:24:51,950 --> 01:24:53,623
Do something, okay?

1301
01:24:53,710 --> 01:24:55,144
There must be something
you can do for him.

1302
01:24:55,230 --> 01:24:57,620
I told you that you were not ready.

1303
01:24:57,710 --> 01:25:01,863
Zordon, please help us, okay? Please.

1304
01:25:01,950 --> 01:25:03,942
There's nothing that I could do for him.

1305
01:25:05,150 --> 01:25:07,745
We were both reckless with our teams.

1306
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:15,425
No.

1307
01:25:18,510 --> 01:25:19,910
I'm sorry.

1308
01:25:25,510 --> 01:25:26,626
I'm sorry, guys.

1309
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:30,861
He's dead because of me.

1310
01:25:32,150 --> 01:25:33,903
No, Jason, it was all of us.

1311
01:25:33,990 --> 01:25:36,585
No, I pushed it.

1312
01:25:36,670 --> 01:25:39,265
And as usual I made the wrong decision.

1313
01:25:39,350 --> 01:25:41,307
Out of... out of fear, anger...

1314
01:25:43,070 --> 01:25:45,539
I don't know, I was just so angry.

1315
01:25:48,470 --> 01:25:50,666
He's... he's a great kid, you know?

1316
01:25:52,510 --> 01:25:54,103
And he loved us.

1317
01:25:54,190 --> 01:25:57,149
He loved... being a ranger.

1318
01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:01,389
I'm sorry, Billy.

1319
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:05,699
I'd trade my life for yours if I could.

1320
01:26:15,430 --> 01:26:17,706
Maybe he traded his life for us.

1321
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:20,548
Yeah. Probably did.

1322
01:26:26,830 --> 01:26:28,230
I would.

1323
01:26:30,910 --> 01:26:32,185
Me too.

1324
01:26:33,550 --> 01:26:35,030
Yeah. Me too.

1325
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:39,025
Me too.

1326
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:43,384
It's just the four of us now.

1327
01:26:48,790 --> 01:26:50,019
The truth is,

1328
01:26:51,230 --> 01:26:54,029
whatever we've said to each other,

1329
01:26:54,110 --> 01:26:55,180
it doesn't matter.

1330
01:26:56,910 --> 01:27:00,620
This. This is the only thing that matters.

1331
01:27:04,270 --> 01:27:05,704
She's right.

1332
01:27:11,390 --> 01:27:13,825
Zordon! Zordon! Look at the grid!

1333
01:27:13,910 --> 01:27:16,630
This is your time! Do... do you see it?

1334
01:27:16,710 --> 01:27:18,622
The grid is open! Step through!

1335
01:27:18,710 --> 01:27:21,544
Yes, I see it. I see it.

1336
01:27:24,150 --> 01:27:26,585
Step through, Zordon!

1337
01:27:26,710 --> 01:27:29,066
- Hey!
- What's happening?

1338
01:27:29,150 --> 01:27:30,869
The morphing grid is open!

1339
01:27:31,950 --> 01:27:33,828
What's going on?

1340
01:27:43,470 --> 01:27:46,463
Zordon? Master?

1341
01:27:48,470 --> 01:27:49,540
Where is he?

1342
01:27:49,630 --> 01:27:51,747
He must have stepped through the grid.

1343
01:27:51,830 --> 01:27:53,310
Alpha, where'd he go?

1344
01:27:53,390 --> 01:27:54,790
I don't know where he is.

1345
01:27:57,830 --> 01:28:00,664
Zordon, what? Why didn't you step though?

1346
01:28:00,750 --> 01:28:02,264
That was your only chance.

1347
01:28:02,350 --> 01:28:03,420
I know.

1348
01:28:04,430 --> 01:28:07,104
But only one can come back.

1349
01:28:12,510 --> 01:28:13,944
Billy!

1350
01:28:17,270 --> 01:28:19,068
- Billy!
- Oh, my God! Hey!

1351
01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:22,785
Are you okay?

1352
01:28:27,670 --> 01:28:29,070
- Did I die?
- Yes.

1353
01:28:29,190 --> 01:28:30,419
- No.
- Little bit.

1354
01:28:30,510 --> 01:28:32,229
And you guys brought me back to life.

1355
01:28:33,790 --> 01:28:35,543
I told you we were superheroes.

1356
01:28:36,630 --> 01:28:39,270
There can only be one Red Ranger.

1357
01:28:40,270 --> 01:28:44,105
Jason, this is your time.

1358
01:28:44,190 --> 01:28:46,910
This is your team.

1359
01:28:46,990 --> 01:28:48,026
Thank you.

1360
01:28:48,110 --> 01:28:52,502
Dude. That was loopy.

1361
01:28:52,630 --> 01:28:54,144
Seein' my dad.

1362
01:29:09,710 --> 01:29:11,429
Welcome back, my friend.

1363
01:29:12,750 --> 01:29:16,266
- Oh, we gotta go to Krispy Kreme, Jason.
- What?

1364
01:29:16,350 --> 01:29:17,545
Not for donuts.

1365
01:29:19,550 --> 01:29:21,030
Okay. Let's try this.

1366
01:29:22,550 --> 01:29:23,984
Thank you, Zordon.

1367
01:29:45,670 --> 01:29:47,627
It's morphin' time.

1368
01:31:20,110 --> 01:31:22,102
Who is that?

1369
01:31:28,350 --> 01:31:29,579
Oh, my God!

1370
01:31:31,790 --> 01:31:33,190
Yes.

1371
01:31:34,230 --> 01:31:36,984
Come back to me, Goldar.

1372
01:31:38,750 --> 01:31:40,582
Come back.

1373
01:31:53,150 --> 01:31:55,221
Hold up. Look.

1374
01:32:06,710 --> 01:32:08,827
All right. Let's do this.

1375
01:32:42,470 --> 01:32:43,745
Yes!

1376
01:32:45,270 --> 01:32:47,705
Yee-haw!

1377
01:32:47,790 --> 01:32:49,622
Whoa, this is so much better with armor.

1378
01:32:53,070 --> 01:32:55,301
Come on! Bring it on!

1379
01:32:56,790 --> 01:32:58,065
Hey, heads up!

1380
01:33:08,270 --> 01:33:10,102
Guys, they just keep coming.

1381
01:33:10,190 --> 01:33:11,863
There's too many of them.

1382
01:33:11,950 --> 01:33:14,709
- You guys hold them off.
- Zack, where are you going?

1383
01:33:14,790 --> 01:33:15,826
Whoo-hoo!

1384
01:33:18,670 --> 01:33:21,947
Make my monster grow!

1385
01:33:28,190 --> 01:33:30,705
I've missed you, my friend.

1386
01:33:35,590 --> 01:33:37,149
They're gonna push us off the edge!

1387
01:33:37,230 --> 01:33:38,869
Incoming!

1388
01:33:46,430 --> 01:33:49,980
Let's kill everyone.

1389
01:33:51,630 --> 01:33:53,144
Did you guys see that?

1390
01:33:54,310 --> 01:33:57,030
All right, who wants me
to pimp their ride, too?

1391
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:03,987
Uh, guys? We're too late.

1392
01:34:07,390 --> 01:34:08,460
Oh, man.

1393
01:34:08,550 --> 01:34:12,021
That's... that's a lotta gold.

1394
01:34:12,110 --> 01:34:14,670
We're gonna protect the crystal, right?

1395
01:34:16,190 --> 01:34:18,705
- We're going to Angel Grove.
- Let's get the Zords.

1396
01:34:20,150 --> 01:34:22,142
This is a lot different than the van.

1397
01:34:28,390 --> 01:34:30,143
Whoo!

1398
01:34:30,230 --> 01:34:32,267
Yippie-kay-yay, motherfu...

1399
01:34:32,350 --> 01:34:34,023
Mother's good. Mother's good.

1400
01:34:34,110 --> 01:34:35,703
Go, go, Power Rangers!

1401
01:34:43,870 --> 01:34:45,429
I'm not going the right way! What?

1402
01:34:45,510 --> 01:34:46,830
Jason, I'm going backwards.

1403
01:34:51,390 --> 01:34:55,669
Guys... our town. She's destroying it.

1404
01:34:57,750 --> 01:34:59,867
Krispy Kreme!

1405
01:35:02,950 --> 01:35:04,509
Not there.

1406
01:35:05,510 --> 01:35:08,344
Rita and her golden boy
haven't found Krispy Kreme yet.

1407
01:35:08,430 --> 01:35:09,750
Okay, Kim, you hold them there.

1408
01:35:09,830 --> 01:35:12,823
Zack, Billy, you circle the Krispy Kreme
and make sure it's safe.

1409
01:35:12,910 --> 01:35:14,105
I'm headed straight for Goldar.

1410
01:35:14,190 --> 01:35:15,340
Copy! I'll hold her off.

1411
01:35:16,350 --> 01:35:17,579
Kim, I'll go with you.

1412
01:35:17,670 --> 01:35:19,104
Let's go, boys.

1413
01:35:19,190 --> 01:35:20,590
Billy, just the two of us.

1414
01:35:20,670 --> 01:35:22,309
I'm right behind you.

1415
01:35:23,670 --> 01:35:24,660
Oops.

1416
01:35:27,750 --> 01:35:28,866
Surprise.

1417
01:35:40,910 --> 01:35:42,469
How cute.

1418
01:35:42,550 --> 01:35:46,385
The rangers found their costumes
and their dino-cars.

1419
01:35:46,470 --> 01:35:49,383
Well, let's give them something else
to play with.

1420
01:36:00,070 --> 01:36:01,584
Crush them!

1421
01:36:05,830 --> 01:36:07,423
How many does she need?

1422
01:36:07,510 --> 01:36:08,739
This is insane.

1423
01:36:11,510 --> 01:36:12,500
Take that!

1424
01:36:16,710 --> 01:36:18,781
Okay. Let's try this!

1425
01:36:21,990 --> 01:36:24,425
Sorry, Bumblebee! Whoo!

1426
01:36:24,510 --> 01:36:25,500
Yeah!

1427
01:36:33,670 --> 01:36:35,229
I can't get 'em off!

1428
01:36:35,310 --> 01:36:37,063
Turn your head. Trust me.

1429
01:36:39,950 --> 01:36:43,102
Okay. Thanks, Kim.

1430
01:36:43,190 --> 01:36:44,465
That's all right.

1431
01:36:49,750 --> 01:36:51,070
That's what you get.

1432
01:36:55,270 --> 01:36:56,499
Whoo!

1433
01:37:09,470 --> 01:37:11,109
The crystal.

1434
01:37:13,790 --> 01:37:14,906
She just found the crystal.

1435
01:37:14,990 --> 01:37:17,186
Okay, come on, let's move!

1436
01:37:28,430 --> 01:37:29,989
I'll take Goldar from the right.

1437
01:37:30,070 --> 01:37:31,982
J! I'm right behind you.

1438
01:37:32,070 --> 01:37:33,390
Come on!

1439
01:37:38,870 --> 01:37:39,986
Jason, it's your dad.

1440
01:37:40,070 --> 01:37:41,663
I'm looking for you. I'm downtown.

1441
01:37:41,750 --> 01:37:43,787
I'm at Mariner Bay and Reefside.

1442
01:37:43,910 --> 01:37:45,947
Call me back soon as you get this.

1443
01:37:47,390 --> 01:37:48,540
How's that feel?

1444
01:37:48,630 --> 01:37:51,828
We got this. Come on!

1445
01:37:51,910 --> 01:37:53,185
- No!
- No!

1446
01:37:55,790 --> 01:37:56,906
I'm coming!

1447
01:38:07,070 --> 01:38:08,424
Ahh!

1448
01:38:43,470 --> 01:38:44,824
Help!

1449
01:38:48,830 --> 01:38:49,980
Give me your hand.

1450
01:38:50,070 --> 01:38:51,265
Help!

1451
01:38:51,350 --> 01:38:55,310
- Sam! Look at me.
- Huh?

1452
01:38:55,390 --> 01:38:57,109
It's okay.

1453
01:38:58,310 --> 01:38:59,744
Give me your hand.

1454
01:39:06,790 --> 01:39:10,466
Dig. Dig, Goldar.

1455
01:39:11,870 --> 01:39:14,783
Me and Zack are gonna try
to push Goldar to the water.

1456
01:39:25,510 --> 01:39:29,140
We're okay. I'm okay. Go.

1457
01:39:32,550 --> 01:39:33,700
Guys, help!

1458
01:39:33,790 --> 01:39:36,589
Billy, I have an idea. Ready?

1459
01:39:36,670 --> 01:39:39,139
Uh... Yeah? For what exactly?

1460
01:39:40,950 --> 01:39:42,430
Oh-ho-ho!

1461
01:39:49,910 --> 01:39:51,549
I don't know what to press, okay?

1462
01:39:56,110 --> 01:39:58,306
Open wide, Rita.

1463
01:39:58,390 --> 01:40:02,145
Let me try...

1464
01:40:32,430 --> 01:40:34,228
Hey, Billy, you okay?

1465
01:40:34,310 --> 01:40:35,426
Yeah, I'm okay.

1466
01:40:35,510 --> 01:40:36,785
That was crazy brave, dude.

1467
01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:38,304
Did we do it?

1468
01:40:38,390 --> 01:40:40,700
Did we... did we win?

1469
01:40:40,790 --> 01:40:42,019
Yeah!

1470
01:41:11,950 --> 01:41:13,543
I feel the crystal.

1471
01:41:15,790 --> 01:41:16,906
She's back.

1472
01:41:32,590 --> 01:41:33,865
That's incredible.

1473
01:41:33,950 --> 01:41:35,703
Oh, my God.

1474
01:41:36,790 --> 01:41:37,906
Come on, let's go!

1475
01:41:43,950 --> 01:41:44,940
Okay, everyone.

1476
01:41:47,510 --> 01:41:49,149
Hold the line.

1477
01:42:01,870 --> 01:42:03,429
Okay.

1478
01:42:03,510 --> 01:42:04,864
We got this.

1479
01:42:04,950 --> 01:42:06,430
Come on!

1480
01:42:09,070 --> 01:42:10,743
Crush them!

1481
01:42:10,830 --> 01:42:12,344
Okay, fire!

1482
01:42:17,950 --> 01:42:19,145
Yeah!

1483
01:42:20,670 --> 01:42:22,229
Come on, guys!

1484
01:42:28,870 --> 01:42:30,020
Ohh!

1485
01:42:32,670 --> 01:42:36,505
If you must come at me... come at me, bro!

1486
01:42:36,590 --> 01:42:37,944
Watch out! Billy!

1487
01:42:43,510 --> 01:42:44,660
Okay.

1488
01:42:46,710 --> 01:42:48,622
Yes!

1489
01:42:51,070 --> 01:42:53,062
Jason, I'm coming in.

1490
01:42:53,150 --> 01:42:55,062
Kim! I got your back.

1491
01:42:58,790 --> 01:42:59,780
I got you.

1492
01:43:11,550 --> 01:43:13,906
I'm burning.

1493
01:43:14,030 --> 01:43:16,750
I can't... I can't breathe.

1494
01:43:26,190 --> 01:43:28,147
He's crushing me!

1495
01:43:28,230 --> 01:43:30,267
Push them into the pit!

1496
01:43:32,310 --> 01:43:33,505
Guys, we're sliding!

1497
01:43:33,590 --> 01:43:36,901
- Come on, everybody, hold the line!
- Fight back!

1498
01:43:41,390 --> 01:43:42,460
It's getting too hot, guys.

1499
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:44,109
I don't know how much longer
I can hold it.

1500
01:43:47,910 --> 01:43:49,185
No one dies alone.

1501
01:43:49,270 --> 01:43:50,784
I'm okay with that.

1502
01:44:02,790 --> 01:44:05,430
Hold the line. Hold the line.

1503
01:44:06,470 --> 01:44:07,699
Hold the line.

1504
01:44:07,790 --> 01:44:09,782
Zack! Zack, stay with me, Zack. Come on.

1505
01:44:26,150 --> 01:44:27,948
Thank you for being my friends.

1506
01:44:31,030 --> 01:44:32,783
Hold on to each other.

1507
01:44:52,350 --> 01:44:54,262
Get my crystal!

1508
01:45:35,830 --> 01:45:37,150
We're alive.

1509
01:45:38,670 --> 01:45:40,502
Guys, we're alive!

1510
01:45:40,590 --> 01:45:43,503
We're like one big, uh... one big Zord.
Like a mama Zord.

1511
01:45:43,590 --> 01:45:46,628
- What?
- No, no, no. That sounds lame. Um...

1512
01:45:46,710 --> 01:45:47,700
a Megazord!

1513
01:45:51,910 --> 01:45:52,980
How?

1514
01:46:13,310 --> 01:46:14,346
Whoa.

1515
01:46:24,230 --> 01:46:25,220
What?

1516
01:46:31,870 --> 01:46:33,827
Oh, shit.

1517
01:46:33,910 --> 01:46:35,469
Bring it on.

1518
01:46:35,550 --> 01:46:37,428
Everyone, let's go!

1519
01:46:43,670 --> 01:46:45,389
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1520
01:46:47,190 --> 01:46:49,182
Whoa, whoa, no, no, no, no!

1521
01:46:50,470 --> 01:46:52,427
That might
have been my fault. I'm sorry, y'all.

1522
01:46:52,510 --> 01:46:53,864
I think Kimberly needs to move our feet.

1523
01:46:53,950 --> 01:46:56,545
- No, I've got the arm.
- Uh, no, I do. I've got the leg.

1524
01:46:56,670 --> 01:46:58,468
- You're a leg, too?
- I have the arm.

1525
01:46:58,590 --> 01:47:00,149
We all have to move together.

1526
01:47:00,230 --> 01:47:01,584
I'll lift us.

1527
01:47:04,670 --> 01:47:06,741
All together on three.

1528
01:47:06,830 --> 01:47:10,619
One, two, three!

1529
01:47:10,710 --> 01:47:11,780
We got this! Come on!

1530
01:47:15,110 --> 01:47:16,669
Zack, catch us.

1531
01:47:22,590 --> 01:47:25,059
Let's go again!

1532
01:47:25,150 --> 01:47:27,506
Kimberly, throw a hook! Now!

1533
01:47:30,350 --> 01:47:31,340
Whoo!

1534
01:47:35,030 --> 01:47:36,100
Oh, I wish I could punch.

1535
01:47:40,750 --> 01:47:42,628
Nice one, Billy!

1536
01:47:49,470 --> 01:47:52,224
Jason, we got anything for that?

1537
01:47:52,350 --> 01:47:54,148
Remember the pit?

1538
01:47:54,270 --> 01:47:55,750
Yeah.

1539
01:47:55,830 --> 01:47:56,820
Hey, I hate the pit!

1540
01:48:01,190 --> 01:48:02,510
- Ready?
- Ready.

1541
01:48:02,590 --> 01:48:04,468
- Ready.
- Ready.

1542
01:48:04,550 --> 01:48:06,348
Ready.

1543
01:48:06,430 --> 01:48:07,420
Now!

1544
01:48:09,350 --> 01:48:10,420
Slip!

1545
01:48:12,190 --> 01:48:13,783
Grab!

1546
01:48:14,790 --> 01:48:16,588
Lift!

1547
01:48:25,990 --> 01:48:28,425
Kim, Trini, pull back on the arms.

1548
01:48:28,510 --> 01:48:30,263
We've got swords.

1549
01:48:42,670 --> 01:48:43,865
Ha!

1550
01:48:45,230 --> 01:48:47,222
Wait!

1551
01:48:48,230 --> 01:48:49,550
Guys...

1552
01:48:53,350 --> 01:48:55,182
Look at me.

1553
01:48:57,750 --> 01:48:59,389
You think you've won?

1554
01:49:01,710 --> 01:49:03,144
I came for the crystal.

1555
01:49:03,230 --> 01:49:05,699
Others will come!

1556
01:49:06,710 --> 01:49:10,670
What you have... it can't last.

1557
01:49:12,510 --> 01:49:14,342
You know I'm right!

1558
01:49:14,430 --> 01:49:17,468
- No.
- No.

1559
01:49:17,550 --> 01:49:20,224
I don't know. But for now,

1560
01:49:20,310 --> 01:49:22,950
I need you to give your staff
and your coin to us.

1561
01:49:23,030 --> 01:49:26,660
And we'll take you to Zordon
and let him be the judge.

1562
01:49:26,750 --> 01:49:30,710
Zordon? Judge me?

1563
01:49:32,750 --> 01:49:34,628
Never!

1564
01:49:35,870 --> 01:49:38,260
No matter what Zordon says,

1565
01:49:38,350 --> 01:49:42,310
I know I am worthy!

1566
01:49:45,230 --> 01:49:46,664
Trini! Now!

1567
01:50:02,550 --> 01:50:05,349
Jason, did you just slap her?

1568
01:50:05,430 --> 01:50:08,070
I did. Weird, right?

1569
01:50:10,670 --> 01:50:12,150
That's cool.

1570
01:50:12,230 --> 01:50:13,380
I guess the bully...

1571
01:50:13,470 --> 01:50:17,225
you guys don't get...
It's the... I got it, buddy.

1572
01:50:17,310 --> 01:50:19,347
Oh, that was scary.

1573
01:50:24,390 --> 01:50:27,144
We did it.

1574
01:50:46,430 --> 01:50:47,864
I told you we'd be famous.

1575
01:50:47,950 --> 01:50:49,270
Is that Principal Feig?

1576
01:50:51,070 --> 01:50:54,222
Hey. No, I... I don't think he can see me.

1577
01:51:14,590 --> 01:51:16,980
Oh, let's wiggle, Jason.

1578
01:51:18,630 --> 01:51:21,065
I call this the algebra. Woo!

1579
01:51:21,150 --> 01:51:22,550
How do you even do that?

1580
01:51:29,550 --> 01:51:31,507
You should keep that.

1581
01:51:33,150 --> 01:51:34,504
You've earned it.

1582
01:51:35,750 --> 01:51:37,309
I'll come back for it.

1583
01:51:37,390 --> 01:51:40,383
That was terrifying. See you, buddy.

1584
01:51:54,390 --> 01:51:55,983
Jeremy Franklin told everyone at school.

1585
01:51:56,070 --> 01:51:58,266
The blue was the best one.
That's who I wanna be.

1586
01:51:58,390 --> 01:51:59,665
Hey, no, I wanna be the blue one!

1587
01:51:59,750 --> 01:52:01,025
I wanna be blue one.

1588
01:52:01,110 --> 01:52:03,944
Hey, how about one of you guys
try to be the yellow one?

1589
01:52:04,030 --> 01:52:07,341
Oh, yeah, the yellow one!
Oh, he's so cool!

1590
01:52:08,350 --> 01:52:10,103
How do you know it's a he?

1591
01:52:32,790 --> 01:52:34,270
Checkmate.

1592
01:52:41,150 --> 01:52:43,710
Billy! Jason Scott is here

1593
01:52:43,790 --> 01:52:46,100
and Kimberly Hart and Zack Taylor

1594
01:52:46,230 --> 01:52:48,028
and some girl named Didi.

1595
01:52:48,110 --> 01:52:50,500
Mom, it's Trini! I'm coming! I'm coming!

1596
01:52:53,950 --> 01:52:57,148
This ranger team
did what my team could not.

1597
01:52:58,470 --> 01:53:01,907
You will humbly walk amongst your peers,

1598
01:53:01,990 --> 01:53:04,346
but heroes you all will be.

1599
01:53:04,430 --> 01:53:07,150
- Attention! Attention in detention.
- Each of your names

1600
01:53:07,230 --> 01:53:10,667
will be etched alongside
the great ranger teams before you.

1601
01:53:13,190 --> 01:53:16,945
I will always owe a debt
of gratitude to you all.

1602
01:55:30,550 --> 01:55:33,463
Oh, we have a new detention student.

1603
01:55:33,550 --> 01:55:35,542
"Tommy Oliver."

1604
01:55:36,990 --> 01:55:38,026
Tommy Oliver?

1605
01:55:40,310 --> 01:55:41,824
Tommy Oliver!

1606
01:55:43,510 --> 01:55:45,069
Tommy Oliver?

1607
01:55:46,110 --> 01:55:47,624
Tommy Oliver!

1608
01:55:51,510 --> 01:55:52,546
Cranston.

1609
01:55:52,630 --> 01:55:53,666
That might have been my fault.

1610
01:55:53,790 --> 01:55:55,429
That might have been my fault,
I'm so sorry.
