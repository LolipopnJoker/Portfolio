00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:49,717
* Come, my lady
Come, come, my lady *

2
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,985
* You're my butterfly
Sugar, baby *

* Come, my lady
Come, come, my lady *

4
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:56,424
* You're my butterfly
Sugar, baby *

5
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,859
* Such a sexy, sexy
Pretty little thing *

6
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:00,027
* Fierce nipple pierce

7
00:01:00,094 --> 00:01:01,495
* You got me sprung
With your tongue ring *

8
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,497
* And I ain't gonna lie 'cause
Your lovin' gets me high *

9
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:04,865
* So to keep you by my side

10
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:06,434
* There's nothin'
That I won't try *

11
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,502
* Butterflies in her eyes
And looks to kill *

12
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,871
* Time is passin' I'm asking
Could this be real? *

13
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:12,606
* 'Cause I can't sleep
I can't hold still *

14
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:14,975
* The only thing I really know
Is she got sex appeal *

15
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:17,178
* I can feel
Too much is never enough *

16
00:01:17,245 --> 00:01:18,612
* You're always there
To lift me up *

17
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:20,614
* When these times get rough

18
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:22,183
* I was lost now I'm found Ever
since you've been around *

19
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,652
* You're the woman that I want
So yo, I'm puttin' it down *

20
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:26,854
* Come, my lady
Come, come, my lady *

21
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,190
* You're my butterfly
Sugar, baby *

22
00:01:29,257 --> 00:01:31,192
* Come, my lady
You're my pretty baby *

23
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:34,094
* I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy *

24
00:01:34,162 --> 00:01:36,164
* Come, my lady
Come, come, my lady *

25
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,466
* You're my butterfly
Sugar, baby *

26
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:40,534
* Come, my lady
You're my pretty baby *

27
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:43,237
* I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy *

28
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:45,439
* Come, my lady

29
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:47,908

32
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,148
* Come, my lady
Come, come, my lady *

33
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:55,749
Ah...

34
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:58,552
The sweet, uncomplicated
satisfaction

35
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,421
of the younger woman.

36
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:01,955
That fleeting age

37
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:04,625
when everything just falls
right into place.

38
00:02:04,692 --> 00:02:07,528
It's magic time,
and it can render any man

39
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:10,931
anywhere,
absolutely helpless.

40
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:13,867
Some say I'm an expert
on the younger woman.

41
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:17,538
Guess that's because I've been
dating them for over 40 years.

42
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:26,680
So, baby,
you're rich?

43
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:29,116
Well, my mother is.

44
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:30,884
Sort of.
I mean, not really.

45
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:34,121
If she lives within a mile
of here, she's rich.

46
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:37,191
Well, I guess a hit play will
buy you a house in the Hamptons.

47
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:39,360
I'd like to meet your mother.
No, you wouldn't.

48
00:02:39,427 --> 00:02:41,729
I mean she's great.
She's totally brilliant,

49
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,063
but she's not your type.

50
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:46,467
You're overlooking one of
the great things about me.

51
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:48,902
I don't have a type.

52
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:50,103
She's over 30.

53
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:52,406
Oh, what?

54
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:55,343
Like you don't know you have
a slight reputation for...

55
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:57,110
For?

56
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,813
For never dating
anyone over 30.

57
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,649
It just so happens,
my dear,

58
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:04,985
that women of a certain age
don't date me.

59
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:07,020
You ever think
of it that way? No.

60
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:09,089
It's always me.

61
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:11,325
Hey.

62
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:13,694
Uh-huh.

63
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:15,663
I'll call back Monday.

64
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,731
Say you couldn't find me.

65
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,667
Who?

66
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,004
I'll, uh, call her later.

67
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,806
No, no, I have the number.

68
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:26,974
Yeah.

69
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:37,585
Make a right.
It's the second driveway on the left.

70
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:39,453
Right.

71
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:45,726
Wow.

72
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:48,228
It's the perfect
beach house.

73
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,532
So,

74
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,000
what are we
gonna do out here,

75
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,470
just the two of us,
for two whole days?

76
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:58,171
Tell me the truth.

77
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,873
Are you at all glad
we waited?

78
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,108
Truth?

79
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,910
No.

80
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:06,013
But I'm extremely glad
we're finally gonna do...

81
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,717
Wanna go for a swim?

82
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:12,286
How long will it
take you to change?

83
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:14,121
Thirty seconds.
Really?

84
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,723
That long?

85
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:18,125
Oh, Har, by the way,
no smoking in the house.

86
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:19,960
My mom doesn't allow it.

87
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:23,697
But she allows you to
strip in the front yard?

88
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,433
Bring guys you're
dating here to...?

89
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:26,934
She doesn't
know everything I do

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,503
or when I do it
or where I do it.

91
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:37,745
Okay. The fabulous
two-story living room,

92
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,880
which, I predict,
we will spend

93
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:42,650
absolutely no time in
whatsoever.

94
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:46,086
It's a knockout.
Thank you.

95
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:48,155
I'm very good at giving
this tour, by the way,

96
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:49,923
although I've never
actually done it

97
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,825
while taking
off my clothes.

98
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:53,193
Uh-huh...

99
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,895
Behind me, the requisite
Hamptons deck

100
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:57,264
complete with
pool and ocean view.

101
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:59,066
Your pants, please.

102
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:02,570
Ladies first.

103
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,938
* You know
it drives me crazy *

104
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:06,374
* Then I think of you

105
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,241
* I just go
Ooh, ooh *

106
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,377
Ooh.

107
00:05:10,378 --> 00:05:13,080
* I won't deny you baby

108
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:18,619
You know, when I first started auctioneering,
someone told me

109
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:20,521
if I was nervous,

110
00:05:20,588 --> 00:05:23,391
I should just picture the
audience in their underwear.

111
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:25,793
This gives that
a whole new meaning.

112
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:28,662
You're not nervous now,
are you?

113
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:31,198
I'm always
a little nervous.

114
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:32,733
So put on your bathing suit.

115
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,735
I brought us some champagne.
I'll put it on ice.

116
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,061
No, I know.
I can't do anything...

117
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,732
Oh, God! What is this?
Okay.

118
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:10,237
Okay, you stay where you are.
We have a knife.

119
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,139
Do you live here?
Look, mister.

120
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,875
I am gonna dial 911,
and you are not gonna move.

121
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:17,711
Zoe, hand me the phone.
You don't understand.

122
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:19,980
I'm your daughter's friend.
Yeah, I don't think so.

123
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,882
My daughter is
in the city.

124
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:24,017
And you, what, you like wander in here,
high on ecstasy?

125
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:26,954
Honestly, if you'd just... No!
Just stay there.

126
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,223
I was in the Israeli army.
I can break you in half.

127
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,160
Hello. Yes! Yes, I have
an intruder in my house.

128
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,728
29 Daniels Lane,
Sagaponack...

129
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:37,064
I'm dating
your daughter, Marin.

130
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,866
She invited me here
for the weekend.

131
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:41,034
She's in her room
right now, changing.

132
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:44,572
You're dating my daughter?

133
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:47,307
Now, who would have thought
that would be worse news?

134
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:48,442
Ah!

135
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:54,448
Uh, yeah, sorry.
False alarm.

136
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:56,784
No, he's not
a burglar.

137
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,251
He's dating my daughter.

138
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:00,287
Mom, I had no idea you were
coming out this weekend

139
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:01,822
because you said
you had to write.

140
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:03,824
Well, I do, honey,
but I thought I would do it out here.

141
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:06,359
I'm an idiot, I should have told
you I was bringing someone out.

142
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,296
I'm sorry.
I should've told you we were coming.

143
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,532
Obviously.
Anyway, here we are.

144
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,966
Hello, I'm the mother.

145
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,768
Harry Sanborn.
How are you?

146
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:17,070
Oh, God, sorry.
This is my friend Harry.

147
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:19,072
Harry, my mom, Erica.
My aunt Zoe.

148
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,140
Sorry about that.

149
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:22,009
We just totally
spur-of-the-moment

150
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:23,243
decided to just get out of
the city for a couple days.

151
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,712
Mm-hm,
Good, that's good.

152
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:28,649
Um, honey, does, uh,
Harry have a robe?

153
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:30,317
You know what?

154
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:32,019
I think I should
just take off,

155
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:34,121
let you gals enjoy
your weekend and...

156
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,723
Ah. What?

157
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:38,191
Um...

158
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:39,527
No, no! Oh, I'm sorry.

159
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:41,461
Of course, don't do that.
That's silly.

160
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:44,865
Zoe and I will leave
and you and Harry stay.

161
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:47,067
And, um, Harry.

162
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,937
I'm sorry. I apologize
about the near arrest.

163
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:53,440
Oh. You were very impressive.
Very strong.

164
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:55,843
Very, uh...

165
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,244
macho.

166
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,379
Well, I don't think
I was exactly macho.

167
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:02,015
Trust me, if I ever catch
a guy in his underwear

168
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:03,483
in my refrigerator

169
00:08:03,551 --> 00:08:07,220
I hope I'm half the man
you were, Mrs. uh...

170
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:09,690
Mrs. uh...
Right, okay. Whatever.

171
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:13,260
All righty, then,
I'm definitely gonna hit the road.

172
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,096
Ladies,
sensational meeting you.

173
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,265
Doll...

174
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,167
Give me a call.
Hold on, hold on,

175
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:23,070
let's not get so dramatic here.
What are we, four teenagers?

176
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:24,404
We're sophisticated people.

177
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:26,740
Why don't we all just
stay for the weekend.

178
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:28,809
Your mother has work to do,
I have papers to grade.

179
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:31,078
You'll do your thing,
whatever that may be,

180
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:32,379
and if we wanna
hang out together,

181
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:35,015
we'll hang out together.
If we don't, we don't.

182
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:37,718
There's no reason we should all
give up this spectacular weekend.

183
00:08:37,785 --> 00:08:39,219
Seriously.

184
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:41,889
I can handle it.
I can totally handle it.

185
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:46,159
I mean, well,
I can handle it.

186
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:48,228
Bonjour, Madame Barry.
Bonjour, Annie.

187
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,803
Impressive.

188
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,237
She started taking
French lessons

189
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:58,606
after she and my dad
split up.

190
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:01,374
Part of her "keep busy,
don't look back" program.

191
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:03,443
Now she's practically fluent.
Marin!

192
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,578
Hm?

193
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:10,517
Okay.
Not bad.

194
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:12,519
Well, yeah.
I am fluent.

195
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:15,689
I'll be right back.

196
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:35,508
It's an epidemic.

197
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,177
Buy some things.

198
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,681
How about
pasta salad?

199
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:42,182
We had that last night.

200
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,417
We did? I don't remember.
Sure. Yeah!

201
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:46,687
Why don't we
get a spread and put it on.

202
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:48,355
Merci, madam.

203
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:51,524
Merci.

204
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:55,629
Oh, sorry.

205
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:58,766
Sorry about that.

206
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:01,101
My fault.
No. It's fine, it's fine.

207
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:08,608
So, Harry,
what do you do?

208
00:10:08,676 --> 00:10:11,344
I'm one of the owners of a record company,
among other things.

209
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:12,545
Really,
which record company?

210
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,181
Drive-By Records.

211
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:15,883
Drive-By Records?

212
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:18,118
Is that a joke?

213
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:20,220
I mean, what is that?

214
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,689
It's a hip-hop label.

215
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:23,156
Hip-hop?

216
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:27,260
Oh, rap. Right, right.
Well, that's, uh, interesting.

217
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,697
Let me see if I get
where you're headed here.

218
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:31,198
I'm sorry,
but look,

219
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:33,166
I hate rap. I do.
I really do.

220
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,368
It's just sort of crude
and violent for my taste

221
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,938
not to mention
just a tad misogynistic.

222
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:41,474
Hey, some people
see rap as poetry.

223
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,876
Yeah, but come on,
how many words

224
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:44,344
can you rhyme
with "bitch"?

225
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:46,346
Next, please.

226
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:48,315
How we doing?

227
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:51,584
Should have left when she
tried to arrest me.

228
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:56,656
So, Mom,
how's the new play?

229
00:10:56,724 --> 00:10:57,958
Are you getting
happy with it?

230
00:10:58,025 --> 00:10:59,559
Well, you know the thing
about me.

231
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:02,395
I'm 90 percent hard work,
10 percent talent.

232
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:05,699
And so far, the talent part
hasn't exactly kicked in yet.

233
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,267
Uh-huh. Right.

234
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,738
What's your play about?
About?

235
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:13,373
Well, I'm not exactly sure,
which is a bit of a problem.

236
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,810
But so far, it's about
a divorced woman, a writer.

237
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:18,678
She's this high-strung,
over-amped, controlling,

238
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:20,047
know-it-all neurotic...

239
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,584
Who's incredibly
cute and lovable.

240
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,920
Mm-hm.

241
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:28,288
It's a comedy.

242
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,224
So...

243
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,392
how did you two meet?

244
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,661
At a wine auction
at Christie's.

245
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:36,663
Harry was the big buyer
of the night.

246
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:40,934
I kept raising my paddle just
to get her to smile at me.

247
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:43,837
Before I knew it,
I bought the entire collection.

248
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:47,174
I mean, every known bottle
of Chateau Margaux.

249
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,743
After that,
the least she could do

250
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,512
was share a bottle
with me.

251
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:53,814
Ever been married, Harry?

252
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,883
No.

253
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:57,384
No, I haven't.
Mom.

254
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,020
Wow. Now, why
do you think that is?

255
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:02,222
Well, some people just
don't fit the mold,

256
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:03,824
and so far, you know...

257
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:05,225
Hey, if it ain't broke...

258
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:07,227
Exactly.
Wait a second.

259
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:08,862
Aren't you like
a famous bachelor?

260
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:11,531
Well, I wouldn't say
I'm famous.

261
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:15,302
Yeah, didn't I read an article
about you in New York magazine?

262
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:17,204
I guess some people
find it interesting

263
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,406
that I've escaped
the noose for so long.

264
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,809
That was the title of the article,
"The Escape Artist."

265
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,744
I read that article.
That was you?

266
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:27,314
Well, you were once engaged
to someone really big.

267
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,549
Who was it?
Joan Collins? No. No.

268
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:30,818
Wait a minute okay,
Carly Simon?

269
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:32,385
Yeah, somebody
cool like that.

270
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:34,121
Somebody like that.
Not Martha Stewart.

271
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:36,523
No! Not Martha Stewart! No.
You could just ask him.

272
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:39,893
No, this is more fun.

273
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,328
It's like I'm not here.

274
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:44,197
Harry was once
engaged to Diane Sawyer.

275
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,465
What?
Right.

276
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:47,034
Diane Sawyer.
I love her.

277
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,735
I'm impressed.
Yeah.

278
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:50,403
Women your age
love that about me.

279
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:55,843
You know what I mean.
Yes, I do.

280
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:58,778
I mean, it's not a bad thing
to say, "women your age."

281
00:12:58,846 --> 00:13:00,513
Oh, no. I'm sure
it was a compliment.

282
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:03,650
It's just, uh...

283
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,552
An accurate
observation. It's...

284
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,954
So when was this?

285
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,690
The engagement?
Long time ago.

286
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:14,227
She was this adorable,
lanky girl from Kentucky

287
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:17,030
with the greatest pair of
legs I have ever seen.

288
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:18,731
Never understood her
ending up

289
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,001
on a job where
she never showed them.

290
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:23,070
You can't be serious.

291
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,105
I mean,
she's Diane Sawyer.

292
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:26,673
She goes into caves
in Afghanistan

293
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:29,276
with a shmatte on her head.
Who cares about her legs?

294
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:31,979
You know what?

295
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:33,480
I hate to eat
and run, but...

296
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:36,049
No!
No, wait. No.

297
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:37,817
Come on. This is
really fascinating,

298
00:13:37,885 --> 00:13:39,352
what's going on
at this table.

299
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,588
Zoe teaches women's studies
at Columbia.

300
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,756
Okay. So this
is gonna hurt.

301
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,526
No. Look,
let's take you and Erica for example. Zoe...

302
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:48,761
Harry, you've been around the
block a few times. Am I right?

303
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,730
What are you,
around 60?

304
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:52,933
Sixty-three!

305
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,434
Fantastic!

306
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,103
Never married,
which, as we know,

307
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,504
if you were a woman,
would be a curse.

308
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,340
You'd be an old maid, a spinster.
Blah, blah, blah.

309
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:03,476
So instead of pitying you,
they write articles about you.

310
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:05,312
Celebrate your
never marrying.

311
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:08,581
You're elusive and ungettable,
a real catch.

312
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:10,650
Then, there's my
gorgeous sister here.

313
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:12,019
No, wait. What...?
Look, please...

314
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:13,120
No, this is interesting.

315
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:16,089
Look at her.
She is so accomplished.

316
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:17,857
The most successful female
playwright since who?

317
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,493
Lillian Hellman?

318
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,964
She's over 50, divorced,
and she sits in night after night after night

319
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:25,865
because available guys
her age want something...

320
00:14:25,933 --> 00:14:27,067
Forgive me
for saying this honey,

321
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:29,069
but they want somebody
that looks like Marin.

322
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:31,738
So, the whole over-50
dating scene is geared

323
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,907
towards men leaving
older women out.

324
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:35,008
And as a result,

325
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:36,977
the women become more
and more productive.

326
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:39,679
and therefore,
more and more interesting.

327
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:42,449
Which, in turn, makes
them even less desirable

328
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:44,151
because as we know, men,

329
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,819
especially older men,
are threatened and deathly afraid

330
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,889
of productive and interesting women.
It is just so clear.

331
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:51,591
Single older women
as a demographic

332
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:53,460
are about as fucked a group
as can ever exist.

333
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,563
Oh, God!

334
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,465
What are you, possessed?

335
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:00,133
How could you
say those things?

336
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,469
It seemed really obvious to me,
the injustice of it.

337
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:03,870
Thank God men
die younger than us.

338
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:06,139
It's the only break we get.
Then you know what?

339
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:07,340
Write a dissertation on it.

340
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,608
But don't announce
to the world

341
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:10,343
that I stay in
night after night

342
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,079
after night...
And by the way, one "night after night"

343
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:13,580
would have been enough.

344
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:17,417
Did you ever realize that I
stay in as a part of my job?

345
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:20,253
And why do you think I married
the director of my plays?

346
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,023
He was the only man
I ever saw.

347
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,225
And anyway,
I like staying in,

348
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:26,559
and I like this time
in my life.

349
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:27,995
Why do I have to
defend myself?

350
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:29,862
I was married
for 20 years. I'm done.

351
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,698
What the hell was that?

352
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,466
I'm sorry, I thought
I was onto something.

353
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:36,203
Honey, what are you doing
with this guy?

354
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,638
He's old.
He's chauvinistic.

355
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:40,340
He's fun.
He's fun?

356
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:42,442
I mean, how is he fun?
He's, like, wrong.

357
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:44,944
Yeah, wrong can be fun.
No. Not this wrong.

358
00:15:45,012 --> 00:15:46,980
He's actually incredibly
smart and fascinating.

359
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:48,181
If you talked to him
about something

360
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:49,749
other than
his marital status

361
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:51,184
you would have found out
how smart he is,

362
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:52,986
he owns, like,
10 different companies.

363
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:54,621
What does that mean,
he owns 10 different companies?

364
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,057
It means he can't commit.
That's what it means.

365
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:59,226
Not that, God forbid,
I want him to commit.

366
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:02,095
Oh, yeah, that I get.

367
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:03,563
Anyway, he said
he thought you two

368
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,933
were very spontaneous
and nice.

369
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,669
And then he said he's leaving
as soon as the sun comes up.

370
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:11,271
What, his car doesn't
have headlights?

371
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:14,841
Wait a minute.

372
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,543
I have no right
to get this nuts.

373
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,278
I'm sorry.

374
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:20,580
He's your friend,
he's not mine.

375
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,582
I'm sorry
and love you.

376
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,251
I love you more.

377
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:32,192
No chance in hell
he said we were nice.

378
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:33,726
Please. None.

379
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:39,799
* I've been
really trying baby *

380
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:41,334
What are they
listening to?

381
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:42,869
I don't care.

382
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,005
* For so long

383
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:47,474
Marvin Gaye?
Uh-huh.

384
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:51,178
* And if you feel
Like I feel *

385
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:53,380
* Let's get it on

386
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:54,914
Ow!

387
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:56,683
Will you stop that?

388
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:57,850
* Let's get it on

389
00:16:57,917 --> 00:17:00,753
That's disgusting, Zoe.
Stop it!

390
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,021
There.

391
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:03,523
Ahh!

392
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:11,398
I know she'll never see him after this
weekend. She can't commit either.

393
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,702
He does sound fun.

394
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,271
Admit it. He's got something.
You felt it, right?

395
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,541
Okay, this is nuts.

396
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:22,775
Mom!

397
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:25,545
Did she say, "Mom"?

398
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:27,380
Mom, hurry!
Ah!

399
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:29,949
Mom!

400
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:35,455
I don't know what happened.
We were fooling around.

401
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:37,657
And then he just said he felt funny,
then he just collapsed.

402
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,461
Harry, what is it?

403
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:44,697
I'm okay. I'm fine.

404
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:46,399
Does your chest hurt?

405
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:49,169
It's like an elephant's
sitting on it.

406
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,538
Call 911, tell them
to send an ambulance.

407
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:52,972
Marin, now!

408
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:56,843
Oh, my God!
What are you doing?

409
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,611
Mouth-to-mouth.

410
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:01,114
Oh, you fucking guy.

411
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:06,853
Yes, we need an ambulance
right away, please!

412
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,756
29 Daniels Lane,
Sagaponack.

413
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,058
Come on, Harry! Look at me!
Look at me, Harry!

414
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,593
9, 10, 11, 12...

415
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,828
* Life can be

416
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:17,897
* Ooh ooh ooh

417
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:20,933
We got him.
Apparent cardiac arrest.

418
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,236
Sinus check, 120.

419
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:26,072
BP?
150 over 95.

420
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:27,840
41. Right here?
On three.

421
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:30,377
All right.
Careful.

422
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:31,678
We've already
got a line in.

423
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:33,346
Switch over to monitors.
How we doing here?

424
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:35,081
Doc, he's had 30 minutes
of chest pain,

425
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:36,349
nausea, shortness
of breath.

426
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,918
Pulse, 104.
Respiration's 18.

427
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:42,054
Let's get a CBC, CMB,
cardiac panel and 12-lead EKG.

428
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,191
Yes, Doctor.
Mr. Sanborn, I'm Dr. Mercer.

429
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:45,458
Are you in any pain
right now?

430
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:47,960
I feel some pressure
in my chest.

431
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:49,196
It's real tight.

432
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,130
You show me where the pain is.
Right here.

433
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,637
What were you doing
when the pain started?

434
00:18:57,704 --> 00:18:59,906
I was kissing
a beautiful woman.

435
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,541
Were you
having intercourse?

436
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:03,943
Unfortunately, no.

437
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,246
Sense of humor intact.
Yeah.

438
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:09,182
Give him an aspirin, metoprolol,
5 milligrams, hang a nitro drip.

439
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:10,850
Mr. Sanborn?
Yeah.

440
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:12,819
Your EKG shows
you have a blocked artery

441
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,120
which is not allowing
enough oxygen

442
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:16,189
to get to the heart muscle.

443
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:17,990
I'm having a heart attack?

444
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:20,460
We're gonna stop it,
but I need to know what medications you take.

445
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:25,798
I take Lipitor.
Chew this.

446
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:27,367
Anything else?

447
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:29,502
And a white one
for blood pressure.

448
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:32,171
And what about Viagra?

449
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:38,511
Mr. Sanborn, did you take
any Viagra today?

450
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:42,181
Mr. Sanborn?
No.

451
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,217
No Viagra.

452
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:45,518
Okay, good,
just need to be sure.

453
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:48,255
Because I put nitroglycerin
into your drip.

454
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:51,658
And if you had taken Viagra,
the combination could be fatal.

455
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:05,204
Your dad's gonna be okay.
He's not my dad.

456
00:20:05,272 --> 00:20:07,374
Oh, I'm sorry.
Your granddad's gonna be okay.

457
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,175
Oh, thank you so much.

458
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,245
We're not related.

459
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:14,281
He's a friend.
Sorry.

460
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,116
I'm Dr. Mercer.

461
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:19,519
Mr. Sanborn did have
a mild heart attack.

462
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:21,588
I gave him something to dissolve
the clot in his artery,

463
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,222
and it worked beautifully.

464
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,557
He's very lucky.

465
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:26,593
Another half-hour,
I don't, uh...

466
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:28,227
I don't know
if this would have worked.

467
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:33,866
This was very intense.

468
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,435
He's doing great.
Yeah.

469
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:37,203
I gave him something
to help him sleep.

470
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,805
It might make him
a little loopy at first

471
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:41,708
but then it, uh,
it should knock him out.

472
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:46,112
You're Mrs. Sanborn? No!
Oh, no. No, I'm just...

473
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,947
No, I'm Erica Barry.

474
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:49,248
He was having dinner
at our house.

475
00:20:49,316 --> 00:20:50,750
I just met him
this afternoon.

476
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:52,485
You're Erica Barry?

477
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:54,454
Yes.
The playwright?

478
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:55,955
Yes.

479
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:58,257
What a pleasure.
I'm a huge fan.

480
00:20:58,325 --> 00:20:59,526
Really?
Huge fan.

481
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,328
Thank you.

482
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:03,563
Wow!

483
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:07,600
Thanks.

484
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,339
Thank you, Doctor.

485
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,943
Erica. Green tea.
Oh! That's hot.

486
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:18,878
Thank you.
You're welcome. May I?

487
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,348
Yeah.
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

488
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:23,583
This is very
sweet of you.

489
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,785
First year of medical school
you learn what can keep you up

490
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:27,887
all night
without making you nuts.

491
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:30,457
You know I heard you had
a house in the Hamptons.

492
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:32,224
Huh?
I really am a big fan.

493
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,260
I think I've seen every play
you've ever written.

494
00:21:34,327 --> 00:21:36,195
I think some were written
before your time.

495
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:37,997
I mean, there's some
Marin's never even seen.

496
00:21:38,064 --> 00:21:40,099
No, I'm pretty sure
I've seen them all.

497
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,468
And I saw
the last one twice.

498
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:43,836
Julian,
we've got a walk-in may need stitches.

499
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:45,605
Okay, thanks.

500
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:47,106
I'll check on Mr. Sanborn.

501
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:48,808
If he's asleep,
you all might want to get some shuteye.

502
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,143
Come back in the morning.

503
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,546
Great to meet you, Erica.
Ladies.

504
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,889
Okay.

505
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:04,924
Now, that's
the perfect guy for you.

506
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,393
He's adorable!

507
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:09,962
Mother,
I've never seen a man less interested in me.

508
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:12,098
Or more
interested in you.

509
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,200
Me?

510
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:16,969
He's 30 years old.
No, he's older than that.

511
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:19,506
Who cares how old he is?
I mean, he's not my type.

512
00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:20,907
He's a gorgeous
wholesome doctor.

513
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:23,175
But he's perfect for you.
And he's hot for you.

514
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:24,544
Which makes him
really perfect.

515
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:25,912
Okay, stop it.

516
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:27,547
He likes my work,
he doesn't like me.

517
00:22:27,614 --> 00:22:29,048
I would never...

518
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:31,117
Shut up.
Uh-oh!

519
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:35,688
Oh, God, is he all right?
Harry!

520
00:22:39,626 --> 00:22:41,394
Harry, over here.

521
00:22:45,565 --> 00:22:49,802
Honey, I wanna go home.
Can you call Leo...?

522
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:52,505
Harry! You've got
to get back into bed.

523
00:22:52,572 --> 00:22:54,474
Woman, you saved
my life.

524
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:58,945
Get a nurse.
Nurse! Nurse!

525
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:00,780
I thank you
from the bottom of my...

526
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:05,284
Even unconscious,
he's a letch!

527
00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:07,420
Get off!
You shouldn't be standing.

528
00:23:10,423 --> 00:23:11,458
There.

529
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:13,493
It's all right.
Thank you.

530
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:19,398
I gotta take a whiz,
girls.

531
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:21,668
We'll take care of that for you,
Mr. Sanborn.

532
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:24,403
Okay, I'd like
to see that.

533
00:23:24,471 --> 00:23:26,338
Okay, here we go.

534
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,041
I'd love to see that.

535
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:31,611
Somebody better get it.
Somebody better get it.

536
00:23:35,515 --> 00:23:37,416
Now, what can I do you for?

537
00:23:37,484 --> 00:23:39,586
I'm here to pick up
Harry Sanborn.

538
00:23:39,652 --> 00:23:42,855
Hi, I'm Dr. Mercer.
Come on, I'll take you to him.

539
00:23:43,456 --> 00:23:45,291
And you are?

540
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,927
I'm Leo Hoffman,
I'm Harry's personal assistant.

541
00:23:47,994 --> 00:23:50,396
Do a little chef,
a little driving, party planning.

542
00:23:50,463 --> 00:23:52,064
whatever the man needs.

543
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:53,633
It sounds like a pretty
interesting job.

544
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,536
I'm going on six years
and never a dull moment.

545
00:23:58,805 --> 00:24:01,908
Okay, Harry,
looks like we're gonna have to let you go.

546
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:03,142
Ooh...

547
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:07,947
Take it easy, kids.

548
00:24:08,014 --> 00:24:09,882
I just, uh...

549
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:12,952
Sat up a little too fast.

550
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:16,623
Doc, tell them.
Am I in good shape?

551
00:24:17,857 --> 00:24:19,592
How were my tests
this morning?

552
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:21,027
He's doing extremely well.

553
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:23,963
Can I hug him?
Absolutely.

554
00:24:27,366 --> 00:24:29,168
Yeah. Okay.

555
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:32,539
Okay. Okay.

556
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:35,107
Let's not get goofy.

557
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:37,109
We got nothing
but good news here.

558
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:38,645
Knock, knock.

559
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:41,781
Hi.
Hey.

560
00:24:41,848 --> 00:24:43,716
I'll catch you on the way out.
Thanks a lot, Doc.

561
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,126
So...

562
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:56,996
I'm some great date, huh?

563
00:24:57,063 --> 00:24:59,165
Whew!
Yeah, Mr. Excitement.

564
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:02,569
Tell me something.

565
00:25:02,635 --> 00:25:05,471
We haven't actually
had sex yet, have we?

566
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:07,574
No.

567
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,276
We haven't.
You're correct on that one.

568
00:25:11,477 --> 00:25:13,345
Something to live for.

569
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:24,323
Down to the cheek.

570
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:35,101
Hold on Tarzan, we're still moving.
Slowly.

571
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:39,906
Hey, I...

572
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,815
Harry, I'm sorry but I can't
let you travel quite yet.

573
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:52,151
I ain't going back
in there.

574
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:53,853
Well, I can't put you
in a car right now,

575
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,588
and I can't leave you
in the parking lot.

576
00:25:55,655 --> 00:25:57,824
I won't sue you,
if that's what you think.

577
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,325
I'll sign
whatever you like.

578
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,827
Just...

579
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,595
let me go back
to the city.

580
00:26:04,864 --> 00:26:06,666
Here's my best offer.

581
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:11,203
I won't put you back in the
hospital if you promise to stay

582
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,905
nearby for a few days.
Get a nurse.

583
00:26:12,972 --> 00:26:16,142
Let me keep an eye on you until
we get your strength back.

584
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:17,610
Stay nearby.

585
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:21,748
Doc, where do you
suggest I go?

586
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,451
* He feel it, she feel it
We feel it *

587
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:27,086
* Here we go

588
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:37,496
Somebody please explain to me how
I ended up babysitting this guy?

589
00:26:37,563 --> 00:26:40,232
This is the best turkey sandwich
I've ever had in my life.

590
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:41,500
You're not even
listening to me.

591
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:43,202
I am. Don't get all pissy.

592
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:44,737
I come here
for peace and quiet.

593
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:46,906
And suddenly,
I'm a character in a Kaufman and Hart play.

594
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,209
And the phone
doesn't stop.

595
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:52,745
And it's never for me.

596
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,281
Sorry to interrupt.

597
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,149
No, that's fine, Leo.
I'll take it.

598
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:58,317
No, it's okay...
No, no, I'll take it.

599
00:26:58,384 --> 00:27:01,520
I don't mind washing them.
Okay.

600
00:27:01,587 --> 00:27:02,722
How you doing?

601
00:27:06,192 --> 00:27:08,728
The man doesn't know my name,
and I'm doing his dishes.

602
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:11,230
I said I'll take it back
tomorrow, okay? Great.

603
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:14,000
I'll take care of it.
Just one second. Hi, Erica?

604
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:16,703
Where shall I put this?
Right here. I'll take it.

605
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:18,304
Great, listen,
Harry has a bad headache.

606
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,139
Do you have any Tylenol?
Tylenol...

607
00:27:20,206 --> 00:27:21,708
That'd be great.
Extra strength would be fantastic.

608
00:27:21,774 --> 00:27:23,542
Hi, I'm Tania.

609
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:25,511
Hi.
Harry's second assistant.

610
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,748
Dave Klein, her assistant.
Nice to meet you.

611
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:31,250
Nice to meet you.
Thank you. Appreciate it.

612
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,922
"What should I do
with this?"

613
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,657
It's an empty water glass.
What are the choices?

614
00:27:38,725 --> 00:27:41,460
Okay, I'm getting
out of your hair.

615
00:27:41,527 --> 00:27:44,530
So you're not ready
to show me any new pages?

616
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:47,233
Dave.
I'm not putting any pressure on you.

617
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:49,501
I'm just asking.
Dad!

618
00:27:49,568 --> 00:27:51,437
I didn't know
you were here.

619
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,805
Just on my way out,
bubby.

620
00:27:52,872 --> 00:27:54,841
Well, I was just gonna drive
back to the city with Zoe,

621
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:56,776
but if you're going,
I'd much rather go with you.

622
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:59,712
Actually, I have someone
to meet before I go.

623
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:01,580
Wait, wait. Wait,
wait, wait, wait.

624
00:28:01,647 --> 00:28:03,449
You're leaving?
Zoe's leaving?

625
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,984
The entourage
is leaving?

626
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:07,119
I'm gonna be stuck
here with him, alone?

627
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,620
The hospital's
sending over a nurse

628
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:09,688
first thing
in the morning.

629
00:28:09,756 --> 00:28:10,990
In the morning?

630
00:28:11,057 --> 00:28:12,391
That's, like,
19 hours from now.

631
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:14,593
Okay, I can handle this.

632
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,263
I'll just get myself
into a Zen place.

633
00:28:18,264 --> 00:28:21,300
Play music.
Cook. Write. Focus.

634
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,855
Thank you.

635
00:28:56,302 --> 00:28:59,906
Well, four mai tais at lunch
is a bit much for anybody.

636
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:03,209
Hi.

637
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,311
Um...

638
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:08,514
Can I call you right back,
doll, huh? Thank you.

639
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:11,784
Hey.

640
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:15,554
What's up?
Okay, here's the thing.

641
00:29:15,621 --> 00:29:17,023
I really don't want
to play the part

642
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:19,025
of the uptight nurse
to your bad-boy patient.

643
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,927
If you want to have another
heart attack, you go ahead,

644
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:22,895
it's your life,
but I have work to do

645
00:29:22,962 --> 00:29:24,763
and I don't have time to make
another run to the hospital

646
00:29:24,831 --> 00:29:28,500
because you're filling your already
clogged arteries with smoke.

647
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:29,802
But more importantly

648
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:32,671
I'd rather not have
my freshly painted house

649
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:34,640
smell like a pool hall.

650
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:40,679
Have you always been like this,
or do I bring it out in you?

651
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:43,482
Just, you know.

652
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:46,886
I don't think I've ever had
this effect on a woman before.

653
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:48,587
What effect do you think
you're having on me?

654
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:50,622
I don't quite recognize it.

655
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:52,859
That's how I know
I never had it before.

656
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:56,562
So, uh,
you don't sleep?

657
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,898
I only need about
four hours a night.

658
00:29:58,965 --> 00:30:00,299
Me too.

659
00:30:00,366 --> 00:30:02,534
I never slept eight hours
in my life.

660
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:04,236
Me either.
I wish I could.

661
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:06,705
Do you want me
to shut these?

662
00:30:06,772 --> 00:30:08,574
The sun comes in pretty
strong in the morning.

663
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,809
Sure.
So, Harry...

664
00:30:10,877 --> 00:30:12,711
Who were you talking to
at this hour?

665
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:13,846
A friend in L.A.

666
00:30:13,913 --> 00:30:16,382
It's only 10:00
on the coast.

667
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:18,750
And that's not
past her bedtime?

668
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:22,254
So you don't get more
mellow as the hours pass?

669
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:24,256
Good night, Harry.

670
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:26,558
Can I ask you
one other thing?

671
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:30,229
What's with
the turtlenecks?

672
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:32,398
It's the middle of summer.
Now, seriously...

673
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:34,466
why do you care
what I wear?

674
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:35,701
Just curious.

675
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,503
I like them.
I've always liked them,

676
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:40,206
and I'm just
a turtleneck kind of gal.

677
00:30:41,073 --> 00:30:42,341
You never get hot?

678
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:46,178
No.
Never?

679
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:49,315
Not lately.

680
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:03,762
Finally.

681
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:07,666
Okay, okay.

682
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:32,491
Holy...!

683
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:37,863
Oh, God!

684
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,498
Oh! Ow!

685
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:40,933
Oh, I'm sorry.

686
00:31:41,968 --> 00:31:43,469
Oh, God, am I sorry.

687
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:46,238
What are you doing?!

688
00:31:46,305 --> 00:31:48,440
I was just trying
to find the kitchen!

689
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:50,476
What? Back here?

690
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:52,378
I got confused.

691
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:54,947
And it was dark
and, uh...

692
00:31:55,014 --> 00:31:57,216
I didn't really
see anything.

693
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,385
Just...

694
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:01,487
Just your tits.

695
00:32:02,488 --> 00:32:03,789
And a little...

696
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:15,334
Goodbye, Mrs. Barry.
Goodbye?

697
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:18,037
You're leaving?
Oh, no, that's not good.

698
00:32:18,104 --> 00:32:20,672
Been fired. Fired?
No, you just started.

699
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:24,443
Not fired, darling.
Just not needed.

700
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:27,113
Not needed? Wait,
what are you talking about?

701
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:29,015
Of course she's needed.
We need her.

702
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:31,817
Oh, no.
I'm actually feeling pretty perky today.

703
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,952
Making quite a comeback.

704
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:37,056
Sorry for your trouble, Mrs. Gimble.
Take care, dear.

705
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,858
You've been wonderful.

706
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:44,263
Listen,
about last night...

707
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,832
Yeah, how about we never
talk about that, okay?

708
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:49,001
Anyway,
I was at the drugstore.

709
00:32:49,068 --> 00:32:50,736
Your prescriptions
were ready.

710
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,571
They said to take these two with food,
this one without.

711
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:53,939
You were in silhouette.

712
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:56,375
Yeah, I think that's
talking about it.

713
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:58,044
I really didn't see
all that much.

714
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,511
Yep, there you go.

715
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:01,380
Okay, I won't
mention it again, but...

716
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:03,349
Going to work, Harry.
Hey!

717
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:06,352
You saw my ass.
You don't see me acting nuts

718
00:33:06,418 --> 00:33:09,755
and wearing glasses
and hats and weird outfits!

719
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:14,126
Yes or no?

720
00:33:14,193 --> 00:33:16,162
What's the deal?

721
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:18,697
Can I go?
You still getting dizzy?

722
00:33:18,764 --> 00:33:21,500
Not as much.
Out of breath?

723
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:24,636
Only sometimes.
Good.

724
00:33:24,703 --> 00:33:26,572
How's Erica treating you?
Who?

725
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,108
Erica.

726
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:32,944
Oh, her.

727
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,781
She is a major
piece of work.

728
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:39,818
Doc, the woman wears turtlenecks
in the middle of the summer.

729
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:42,154
She's beyond uptight.

730
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:44,790
Almost makes her fun
to be around.

731
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:48,527
Uptight? That's funny,
I haven't noticed that.

732
00:33:48,594 --> 00:33:49,828
Try living with her.

733
00:33:51,397 --> 00:33:54,900
I actually saw her
naked last night.

734
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:58,437
That doesn't sound so uptight.
It was an accident.

735
00:33:58,504 --> 00:34:00,072
She thought
I was asleep,

736
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:02,241
I thought her room
was the kitchen.

737
00:34:02,308 --> 00:34:05,211
You know what Freud said,
"There are no accidents."

738
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:09,548
Trust me.
This was an accident.

739
00:34:11,016 --> 00:34:13,152
Although, why would she
be walking around naked

740
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,687
when she knows
I'm 20 feet away?

741
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:18,657
Why would you think
her bedroom was a kitchen?

742
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:21,627
It was dark.
It was 2:00 in the morning.

743
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:24,096
That could explain why
she was walking around naked.

744
00:34:24,163 --> 00:34:25,431
Deep breath.

745
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:28,967
You know, I've never seen a
woman that age naked before.

746
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,103
You're kidding.

747
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:34,340
Hey, we're not
all doctors, baby.

748
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,244
I think she's
very beautiful.

749
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:41,180
And she's a fantastic
writer, you know.

750
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:43,149
No, I don't know.

751
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:46,585
She's pretty major.

752
00:34:46,652 --> 00:34:49,755
So you date her daughter?
Okay.

753
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:51,957
Now, she's a great chick.

754
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:54,660
Must take
after her father.

755
00:34:54,726 --> 00:34:57,396
Which reminds me.
Doc...

756
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,566
What about
Mr. Midnight, here?

757
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,672
When can I be up and running
in that department?

758
00:35:06,738 --> 00:35:08,540
I think Mr. Midnight
needs to stay put

759
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:10,342
for another
couple of weeks.

760
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:12,778
But it won't kill me
when I do it, right?

761
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:15,847
No, it's exercise.
It'll be good for you.

762
00:35:15,914 --> 00:35:17,949
After a heart attack,
rule of thumb is:

763
00:35:18,016 --> 00:35:22,020
If you can climb a flight of stairs,
you can have sex.

764
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:39,871
* You can get it
If you really want *

765
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:42,674
* But you must try
Try and try *

766
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:45,644
So you're saying he can't travel at all?
Not even by plane?

767
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:49,281
Train?
I don't think so.

768
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:52,218
Been tough, huh?

769
00:35:52,284 --> 00:35:54,386
Well, I mean, he fired
his nurse after an hour,

770
00:35:54,453 --> 00:35:56,288
and now says
he doesn't even need one.

771
00:35:56,355 --> 00:35:59,291
He's a bit of a workout.
Yeah. How are you holding up?

772
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:00,692
Me?
You.

773
00:36:01,327 --> 00:36:02,928
Well, I'm, uh...

774
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:05,364
I'm fine. Fine.

775
00:36:05,431 --> 00:36:07,299
One more "fine"
and I won't believe you.

776
00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:12,304
Wait, where's my...?

777
00:36:14,373 --> 00:36:16,275
Thank you.
You're welcome.

778
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:17,943
Hello?

779
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:20,479
Hey!

780
00:36:21,647 --> 00:36:23,782
Hey, hi.
I know, I'm sorry.

781
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:25,284
I haven't been able
to get back.

782
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:27,819
No...

783
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,290
Part of the play
takes place in Paris

784
00:36:31,357 --> 00:36:33,058
so I keep listening
to French music,

785
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:36,462
hoping to get inspired.
No, it's not helping at all.

786
00:36:38,497 --> 00:36:41,032
Well, I'm trying.

787
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:44,536
It's not exactly flowing out
of me yet, but...

788
00:36:48,006 --> 00:36:49,808
Pick you up
around 7:00?

789
00:36:52,177 --> 00:36:53,211
Oh.

790
00:36:54,413 --> 00:36:58,550
So, uh, what about
the patient?

791
00:36:58,617 --> 00:37:00,118
Like he said,
he doesn't need a nurse.

792
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,009
I'm walking
around the house!

793
00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:29,047
Oh, no.

794
00:37:32,618 --> 00:37:34,286
Hi.

795
00:37:34,353 --> 00:37:39,224
Listen, I've decided to get over that whole
"you saw me naked" thing.

796
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:41,026
So let's just not deal
with it anymore. Okay?

797
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,328
Good,

798
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:44,563
because I have been hiding
from you all day.

799
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:47,833
Do you want to come in?

800
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:51,102
Well, uh, I don't want to break
your rhythm or anything like that.

801
00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:52,638
That would be
wishful thinking.

802
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,342
Nice painting.

803
00:37:56,408 --> 00:37:59,645
So I'm gonna venture out there
and go for a short walk.

804
00:37:59,711 --> 00:38:02,548
You up to that? Yeah.
My doctor recommended it.

805
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:06,985
I gotta build up to climbing
stairs and stuff like that.

806
00:38:08,387 --> 00:38:10,622
You wouldn't want
to join me?

807
00:38:10,689 --> 00:38:11,923
That means you
don't want me to?

808
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:15,661
No. I was asking
if you wanted to.

809
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:18,330
Oh, yeah I would,
of course I would,

810
00:38:18,397 --> 00:38:19,498
but I usually
don't like to break

811
00:38:19,565 --> 00:38:21,333
once I've started writing,
so I shouldn't.

812
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,535
I mean, not that a little
fresh air would hurt.

813
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:27,172
It's just a walk, Erica,
not a marriage proposal.

814
00:38:28,574 --> 00:38:33,211
You know my name.
Erica Jane Barry.

815
00:38:33,278 --> 00:38:35,614
I looked you up
on the Internet.

816
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:43,489
Do you know that there are over
8000 websites that mention you?

817
00:38:43,555 --> 00:38:46,425
That's not possible.
Yeah, it's true.

818
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:48,326
I know everything
about you now,

819
00:38:48,394 --> 00:38:50,295
and not because
of last night.

820
00:38:50,362 --> 00:38:53,264
Yeah, no, no.
I understood.

821
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,866
Actually,
I looked you up too.

822
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:56,402
You did?
Uh-huh. Yeah.

823
00:38:56,468 --> 00:38:59,337
I knew you grew up in L.A.,
which I thought nobody did.

824
00:38:59,405 --> 00:39:03,108
You started your own record label at 29,
very impressive.

825
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:06,344
Sold it at 40,
even more impressive.

826
00:39:06,412 --> 00:39:09,280
Then you started a magazine,
dabbled in the Internet

827
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:12,317
and then you invested
in a small record company

828
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,185
which you turned
into the second largest

829
00:39:14,252 --> 00:39:15,554
hip-hop label
in the world.

830
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:19,157
It's exhausting
just hearing about it.

831
00:39:19,224 --> 00:39:21,727
Yeah, I know.
I know, but...

832
00:39:23,595 --> 00:39:26,632
The truth is,
it goes by fast, doesn't it?

833
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:29,100
Like the blink of an eye.
Yeah.

834
00:39:30,669 --> 00:39:32,137
Look at this.

835
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:39,611
I notice that you have bowls
of those all over your house.

836
00:39:39,678 --> 00:39:42,380
I know.
It's so crazy, I know.

837
00:39:42,448 --> 00:39:45,150
But I just think
they're beautiful.

838
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,586
But why do you only
pick up the white ones?

839
00:39:47,653 --> 00:39:49,320
What do you mean?
I don't pick up only the white ones.

840
00:39:50,556 --> 00:39:52,390
So you really are crazy.

841
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:57,228
I know. I only pick up
the white ones. Oh, God.

842
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:02,434
What does that mean?
That I'm controlling?

843
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:04,269
Unadventurous? What?

844
00:40:05,537 --> 00:40:07,205
So you're as hard
on yourself

845
00:40:07,272 --> 00:40:09,407
as you are on
everyone else.

846
00:40:17,516 --> 00:40:18,784
Something
to remember me by.

847
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:27,626
Can I ask you
something, Harry?

848
00:40:27,693 --> 00:40:29,595
Yeah, sure.
Go ahead, shoot.

849
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:31,129
What's with all
the young girls?

850
00:40:31,196 --> 00:40:33,565
I mean, what's the
story there? Really?

851
00:40:33,632 --> 00:40:35,867
Just like to travel light.

852
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:39,037
You just like
to travel...? Oh, God!

853
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:41,540
I'm sorry,
but what does that mean?

854
00:40:41,607 --> 00:40:44,543
Now, see,
a 30-year-old gets that.

855
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:46,144
You mean,
falls for it.

856
00:40:46,211 --> 00:40:49,014
I mean, accepts it.
Acceptance is key.

857
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,617
Okay, if that's what you want,
a non-threatening woman

858
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:55,353
who doesn't get your number,
you get to run the show...

859
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:58,724
I think our relationship
is growing, by the way.

860
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:02,027
Have you noticed?
I'm serious.

861
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:05,030
Maybe we just need
to get out of the house.

862
00:41:05,096 --> 00:41:07,499
Now, you may notice,
interestingly,

863
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:10,001
we're walking back
toward the house

864
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:13,104
and it's getting
a little rocky again.

865
00:41:13,171 --> 00:41:16,508
Of course it's getting rocky.
We're talking about you.

866
00:41:16,575 --> 00:41:20,345
See, I'll accept
that slight hostility

867
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:22,781
because I'm enjoying
your company so much.

868
00:41:22,848 --> 00:41:24,049
Okay...

869
00:41:28,787 --> 00:41:30,255
Are you okay?

870
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:35,393
Yeah, yeah,
but, uh...

871
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,496
I think I'll stay down here
and watch the sun set.

872
00:41:38,564 --> 00:41:41,132
You interested?
Ringside seat.

873
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,001
Well...

874
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:45,070
um...

875
00:41:45,136 --> 00:41:46,538
Big dinner date?

876
00:41:46,605 --> 00:41:49,908
Yeah, as a matter of fact,
with your doctor.

877
00:41:49,975 --> 00:41:52,744
Oh, my doctor.

878
00:41:52,811 --> 00:41:54,045
Wait a minute.

879
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:55,847
Because he's
not too young for you?

880
00:41:55,914 --> 00:41:57,382
No, he's totally
too young for me!

881
00:41:57,448 --> 00:42:00,418
But we're just having dinner,
it is absolutely not a date.

882
00:42:00,485 --> 00:42:02,721
Does he know that?
I'm gonna tell him.

883
00:42:02,788 --> 00:42:05,256
But I doubt he thinks
of it that way.

884
00:42:05,323 --> 00:42:08,159
I doubt that
you doubt it.

885
00:42:08,226 --> 00:42:11,997
Anyway, you may like it.
Think of it this way.

886
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:14,532
He's non-threatening,
won't get your number,

887
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,568
you get to run the show...
That is so unfair!

888
00:42:16,635 --> 00:42:19,504
Trust me.
Could be a great night.

889
00:42:23,942 --> 00:42:25,243
Look who's
answering the door.

890
00:42:26,344 --> 00:42:27,545
And look who's
at the door.

891
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,982
I brought you something.

892
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:33,051
A heart-healthy dinner
from our cafeteria.

893
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:35,286
Why, thank you.

894
00:42:38,724 --> 00:42:39,891
Hello.

895
00:42:44,462 --> 00:42:46,397
You look beautiful.
Thank you.

896
00:43:02,547 --> 00:43:04,415
Hi, it's Marin.
I'm not in right now,

897
00:43:04,482 --> 00:43:06,618
so leave a message
and I'll call you back.

898
00:43:06,685 --> 00:43:08,453
It's me.

899
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:12,057
Just sitting around,
looking at your baby pictures.

900
00:43:13,124 --> 00:43:14,726
Thinking of you.

901
00:43:20,899 --> 00:43:22,167
Hi! You've reached
Brooke and Shannon.

902
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:24,335
For Brooke, push 1.
For Shannon, push 2.

903
00:43:27,873 --> 00:43:30,909
Everybody is out
but old Har.

904
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:33,344
Old,

905
00:43:34,646 --> 00:43:35,714
old,

906
00:43:37,649 --> 00:43:38,717
old,

907
00:43:40,585 --> 00:43:42,420
old Har.

908
00:44:16,121 --> 00:44:17,723
Top of the heap.

909
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:21,459
Julian,
can I ask you something?

910
00:44:21,526 --> 00:44:22,794
Anything.

911
00:44:22,861 --> 00:44:24,462
How old are you?

912
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:26,998
I'm 36.

913
00:44:27,065 --> 00:44:29,334
So I am,
like almost 20 years older than you.

914
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,536
That's an enormous amount of
years to be older than somebody,

915
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:32,938
don't you think?

916
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:34,505
Don't think
it matters at all.

917
00:44:34,572 --> 00:44:36,507
Ah-ha. You don't?
I don't.

918
00:44:38,443 --> 00:44:39,845
Okay, but...

919
00:44:40,979 --> 00:44:43,648
But in terms of us,
I mean you just...

920
00:44:43,715 --> 00:44:46,551
You just want us
to be friends, right?

921
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:49,287
Honestly? No.

922
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:51,189
So, what do you
want to be?

923
00:44:51,256 --> 00:44:53,091
I think I'd embarrass
you if I told you.

924
00:44:53,158 --> 00:44:57,528
I was embarrassed just
getting dressed to see you.

925
00:44:57,595 --> 00:45:00,832
This may surprise you,
but some women consider me quite the guy.

926
00:45:00,899 --> 00:45:03,334
Uh-huh.
I've never been married, I'm a doctor.

927
00:45:03,401 --> 00:45:06,337
You wouldn't believe what
catnip that is for some women.

928
00:45:06,404 --> 00:45:08,239
Oh, yes, I would.
It's just...

929
00:45:08,306 --> 00:45:10,208
Don't you like girls
your own age?

930
00:45:10,275 --> 00:45:13,378
I do, but I've never met one
I've reacted to...

931
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:16,514
quite like this.

932
00:45:16,581 --> 00:45:19,050
And, uh, when something
happens to you

933
00:45:19,117 --> 00:45:21,219
that's never happened
to you before

934
00:45:21,286 --> 00:45:23,755
don't you have to at least
find out what it is?

935
00:45:23,822 --> 00:45:25,456
I suppose.
I mean, I don't know.

936
00:45:25,523 --> 00:45:27,392
This is an area that's
a little tricky for me.

937
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:30,395
See, I don't really date all
that much or all that well.

938
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:32,397
Come on.
You must beat them away with a stick.

939
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:35,533
You're kidding, right?
No.

940
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:40,671
No! Men my age,
or at least the ones I've met, well...

941
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,273
Look, I'm not that
regular of a person,

942
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,575
and they really...
they like regular.

943
00:45:44,642 --> 00:45:46,177
Men your age
may be really stupid.

944
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:48,379
Did you ever
think of that?

945
00:45:48,446 --> 00:45:51,349
Yes, I have.
Many times.

946
00:46:01,192 --> 00:46:02,994
I knew you'd smell good.

947
00:46:03,061 --> 00:46:04,595
It's just soap.

948
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:07,198
Erica...
What?

949
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:09,567
you're incredibly sexy.
No.

950
00:46:11,236 --> 00:46:13,972
Swear to God, I'm not.

951
00:46:58,416 --> 00:46:59,550
I'm back!

952
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:02,988
Have fun?

953
00:47:04,055 --> 00:47:05,790
It was interesting.

954
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:11,162
Good night, Harry.

955
00:47:13,231 --> 00:47:14,399
Night.

956
00:47:21,973 --> 00:47:23,942
Just get rid of that.
That's good.

957
00:47:28,646 --> 00:47:30,882
"Harry37.
What are you doing?"

958
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,654
Harry37?

959
00:47:38,123 --> 00:47:40,758
"What are you doing?"

960
00:47:40,825 --> 00:47:42,928
Writing. Hi.
What are you doing?

961
00:47:46,831 --> 00:47:49,100
Of course.
Relentless.

962
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:52,904
Watching Joan Rivers
sell jewelry.

963
00:47:56,507 --> 00:47:58,243
"So was your date a date?"

964
00:48:00,745 --> 00:48:02,780
Yeah, I think so.

965
00:48:13,758 --> 00:48:15,093
...dinner.

966
00:48:26,304 --> 00:48:29,040
I don't understand how
he knows everything.

967
00:48:40,218 --> 00:48:41,552
...in the kitchen?

968
00:48:44,155 --> 00:48:45,390
...PJ's.

969
00:48:47,558 --> 00:48:49,527
In her PJ's.

970
00:48:56,001 --> 00:48:57,535
"Pajama party."

971
00:48:58,003 --> 00:48:59,237
Oh, man.

972
00:49:18,089 --> 00:49:19,257
We are cute.

973
00:49:19,324 --> 00:49:21,692
Yeah, well, this is
pretty unusual for me.

974
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:23,161
I'm not used
to having sleepovers.

975
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:25,730
Me either.

976
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:28,433
Really?
With your social life, huh?

977
00:49:28,499 --> 00:49:32,703
My dear,
you're confusing sex with sleeping.

978
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:36,107
Sleeping is something
that I prefer to do alone.

979
00:49:36,174 --> 00:49:38,943
Okay. Good to know.

980
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:41,879
What are you hungry for?
What are my choices?

981
00:49:41,946 --> 00:49:44,015
I mean, I know you think

982
00:49:44,082 --> 00:49:46,717
I'm not very discriminating
when it comes to...

983
00:49:46,784 --> 00:49:50,755
Oh, please. What difference does
it make what I think of you?

984
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,224
I can't even imagine
what you think of me.

985
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:59,130
Okay. Pancakes, pasta,
leftover coq au vin.

986
00:49:59,197 --> 00:50:01,399
Grilled cheese?
Pancakes.

987
00:50:01,466 --> 00:50:03,501
Ah! Totally what I wanted.

988
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:08,039
You ever miss
being married?

989
00:50:10,041 --> 00:50:12,777
Bet you were great at it.
Sometimes.

990
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:15,546
Yeah. At night. But not
that much anymore.

991
00:50:15,613 --> 00:50:18,416
Was one of us just saying
something interesting?

992
00:50:18,483 --> 00:50:20,951
You said you can't imagine
what I think of you.

993
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:23,854
Oh! Yeah, that. You don't
have to answer that.

994
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:26,891
Okay.

995
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:29,994
I mean, if you had an opinion,
I'd be curious.

996
00:50:30,061 --> 00:50:33,698
Will you tell me first why you
only miss being married at night?

997
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:36,234
Well,
the phone doesn't ring that much at night

998
00:50:36,301 --> 00:50:39,237
and the whole alone thing
happens at night.

999
00:50:39,304 --> 00:50:41,672
Sleeping by myself
took some getting used to,

1000
00:50:41,739 --> 00:50:42,840
but I got the hang of it.

1001
00:50:42,907 --> 00:50:44,442
You gotta sleep
in the middle of the bed.

1002
00:50:44,509 --> 00:50:46,311
It's not absolutely
not healthy to have a side

1003
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:48,746
when no one has
the other side.

1004
00:50:48,813 --> 00:50:51,582
Now I'm convinced that what
I think about you is right.

1005
00:50:53,184 --> 00:50:54,485
You're a tower of strength.

1006
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:57,588
Try not to rate my answer.

1007
00:50:57,655 --> 00:51:00,225
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry, but...

1008
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:01,659
You know
what you're like?

1009
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:03,394
You're like one
of those great portraits

1010
00:51:03,461 --> 00:51:05,896
you see over a fireplace.

1011
00:51:05,963 --> 00:51:09,334
Words have been invented
to describe women like you.

1012
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,535
Such as?

1013
00:51:12,837 --> 00:51:14,305
Flinty.

1014
00:51:14,372 --> 00:51:15,473
And...

1015
00:51:16,241 --> 00:51:17,675
Impervious.

1016
00:51:17,742 --> 00:51:19,110
So you think I'm inhuman?

1017
00:51:19,177 --> 00:51:22,780
No. I think
you're formidable.

1018
00:51:22,847 --> 00:51:25,783
Yeah, cold, distant,
like I'm frozen in some painting?

1019
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:27,585
Not at all.

1020
00:51:27,652 --> 00:51:29,254
But I do think that
you use your strength

1021
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,156
to separate yourself
from everyone.

1022
00:51:32,657 --> 00:51:35,826
But it's thrilling when
your defenses are down

1023
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,729
and you're not isolated.

1024
00:51:38,796 --> 00:51:41,332
That, I believe,
is your winning combo.

1025
00:51:41,399 --> 00:51:42,767
Killer combo, actually.

1026
00:51:46,637 --> 00:51:50,441
You know, I can't decide if,
oh, God, do you hate me?

1027
00:51:50,508 --> 00:51:53,043
Or if, uh...

1028
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,613
you're like the only person
who ever really got me.

1029
00:51:56,581 --> 00:51:58,216
I don't hate you.

1030
00:51:59,884 --> 00:52:01,619
You don't?
No.

1031
00:52:11,162 --> 00:52:12,230
Mom?

1032
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:17,101
Surprise!
Well...

1033
00:52:17,168 --> 00:52:18,636
Hi!
Room service.

1034
00:52:18,703 --> 00:52:21,138
Honey, what are you
doing here at this hour?

1035
00:52:21,206 --> 00:52:23,007
Well, I had this
big benefit tonight.

1036
00:52:23,073 --> 00:52:24,309
And then I went out
with a bunch of friends,

1037
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:26,244
then I checked
my messages

1038
00:52:26,311 --> 00:52:29,414
and I got this so sad
phone call from Harry.

1039
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:33,484
So bored out here, so I figured I should
come up and see how you're doing.

1040
00:52:33,551 --> 00:52:36,120
Thank you so much for the gorgeous flowers,
by the way.

1041
00:52:36,754 --> 00:52:38,956
They're so huge.

1042
00:52:39,023 --> 00:52:40,725
It's a pleasure.

1043
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:43,761
Oh, that is so sweet.
You guys are making pancakes?

1044
00:52:43,828 --> 00:52:46,331
You're both in your PJ's!
I feel like I'm interrupting!

1045
00:52:46,397 --> 00:52:48,333
Don't be silly.
You know I never sleep.

1046
00:52:48,399 --> 00:52:50,301
This one
doesn't sleep either.

1047
00:52:50,368 --> 00:52:51,436
Ooh.

1048
00:52:52,237 --> 00:52:53,938
Hello?

1049
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:56,674
No, I'm here, babe.
I made record time.

1050
00:52:59,744 --> 00:53:01,746
Is everybody still there?

1051
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,581
Okay.

1052
00:53:04,048 --> 00:53:05,115
Yes.

1053
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,352
Okay, bye.

1054
00:53:07,418 --> 00:53:09,086
Mar?
Yeah.

1055
00:53:09,153 --> 00:53:11,422
Now that you're here,
why don't you just finish the pancakes

1056
00:53:11,489 --> 00:53:12,790
and I'll get back to work.

1057
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:15,092
Mom, I just got here.

1058
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:18,296
By the way, Dad totally
stood me up today.

1059
00:53:18,363 --> 00:53:19,730
I was supposed to have
lunch with him at Barney's

1060
00:53:19,797 --> 00:53:21,666
and he just
never showed up.

1061
00:53:21,732 --> 00:53:24,502
Was he always like this?
Honey, I don't know.

1062
00:53:24,569 --> 00:53:26,537
See, that's happens when
a couple gets divorced.

1063
00:53:26,604 --> 00:53:30,007
The kid inherits all the
problems. Not that I'm a kid.

1064
00:53:32,076 --> 00:53:35,145
So, hey. How are you?
How are you feeling?

1065
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:36,947
Well...

1066
00:53:44,922 --> 00:53:47,625
So tell me.
When can you go home?

1067
00:53:47,692 --> 00:53:49,294
I really am gonna
do a little work,

1068
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,928
and so why don't you
just finish this

1069
00:53:50,995 --> 00:53:54,599
and you two catch up and, uh,
you know how to fix these.

1070
00:53:56,601 --> 00:53:58,102
You don't want
pancakes anymore?

1071
00:54:02,773 --> 00:54:04,174
Oh, I don't.

1072
00:54:07,512 --> 00:54:09,213
No. I don't.

1073
00:54:19,424 --> 00:54:20,958
I'm breaking up
with Harry.

1074
00:54:21,025 --> 00:54:23,260
What do you mean? Why?

1075
00:54:23,328 --> 00:54:24,595
Because I met
someone else.

1076
00:54:24,662 --> 00:54:25,896
In the two days
you've been gone?

1077
00:54:25,963 --> 00:54:27,698
You know me,
my life's crazy.

1078
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:29,400
I meet a thousand
new people every day.

1079
00:54:29,467 --> 00:54:30,768
Besides, let's face it.

1080
00:54:30,835 --> 00:54:32,403
He's insanely
too old for me.

1081
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:34,004
I'd be nuts to keep
this thing going.

1082
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:35,840
True.

1083
00:54:35,906 --> 00:54:39,176
But you know, he's...

1084
00:54:39,243 --> 00:54:42,380
I know. He's soulful
when you don't expect it.

1085
00:54:42,447 --> 00:54:45,215
Oh, my God.
It's unnerving!

1086
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:46,751
Now, Mom, listen.

1087
00:54:46,817 --> 00:54:49,587
I was thinking,
if you could handle this:

1088
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:52,122
You and Harry.

1089
00:54:52,189 --> 00:54:54,925
I can't handle it,
wouldn't want to handle it.

1090
00:54:54,992 --> 00:54:57,061
You're only saying that
because you think

1091
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,429
that he and I
have had sex.

1092
00:54:58,496 --> 00:55:00,398
Shut...
Lower your voice!

1093
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:02,567
Haven't you?

1094
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:04,969
Never, not even close,
I swear to God.

1095
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:06,604
Now I'm just
putting this out there

1096
00:55:06,671 --> 00:55:09,239
because for two people who are
convinced they've got life beat

1097
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:10,475
there was
something cooking

1098
00:55:10,541 --> 00:55:12,510
in the kitchen last night
other than pancakes.

1099
00:55:27,725 --> 00:55:29,427
Hello?
I've waited a reasonable

1100
00:55:29,494 --> 00:55:31,028
amount of hours
before calling you

1101
00:55:31,095 --> 00:55:34,865
even though you've been on my
mind since I woke up at 5:15.

1102
00:55:34,932 --> 00:55:37,001
I'm wondering when we
could have dinner again?

1103
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:38,369
I have to work
the next few nights.

1104
00:55:38,436 --> 00:55:40,371
If we wait till next week,
I know you'll chicken out.

1105
00:55:40,438 --> 00:55:42,540
So how's Friday?
I know it's like a date night,

1106
00:55:42,607 --> 00:55:43,708
but I think
that's a good thing.

1107
00:55:43,774 --> 00:55:45,342
Who is this?

1108
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:47,177
I'm kidding.

1109
00:55:48,145 --> 00:55:49,880
Funny.

1110
00:55:49,947 --> 00:55:51,382
Can you meet me
at The Grill at 8:00?

1111
00:55:51,449 --> 00:55:53,718
Okay. Yes. Seems fine.

1112
00:55:53,784 --> 00:55:56,120
I look forward
to seeing you too.

1113
00:56:03,961 --> 00:56:06,697
He's all yours. Stop that.
How'd he take it?

1114
00:56:06,764 --> 00:56:11,001
He just took care of it
for me. He was an ace.

1115
00:56:11,068 --> 00:56:12,437
Elegant.

1116
00:56:12,503 --> 00:56:14,104
He said our fate
was to be friends.

1117
00:56:15,573 --> 00:56:18,208
Oh, my God.

1118
00:56:18,275 --> 00:56:21,011
Oh, my God, he was breaking up with me.
I didn't even...

1119
00:56:21,078 --> 00:56:22,279
He's a genius.

1120
00:56:22,346 --> 00:56:24,281
That's not possible.
He wouldn't.

1121
00:56:24,348 --> 00:56:26,250
He absolutely did.
And you know what?

1122
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:27,918
It doesn't matter,
because we're done

1123
00:56:27,985 --> 00:56:30,521
and we both feel
fine about it. Okay?

1124
00:56:31,522 --> 00:56:33,257
Clean slate.

1125
00:56:34,525 --> 00:56:36,193
I gotta go.

1126
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:37,528
Oh, okay.

1127
00:56:38,429 --> 00:56:40,264
Now, Erica.
Huh?

1128
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:41,732
Try to think of this

1129
00:56:41,799 --> 00:56:44,334
as the absolute smartest thing
you've ever done for yourself.

1130
00:57:35,219 --> 00:57:37,822
What is going on?
Oh, my God.

1131
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:41,125
Oh...

1132
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:46,030
Ooh.

1133
00:57:50,735 --> 00:57:51,969
Candles?

1134
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:54,639
Romantic.

1135
00:58:02,379 --> 00:58:07,017
* My love must be a kind
Of blind love *

1136
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,557
* I can't see anyone

1137
00:58:12,623 --> 00:58:14,592
* But you

1138
00:58:17,061 --> 00:58:18,863
* Shoo bop shoo bop

1139
00:58:21,899 --> 00:58:23,768
I'm sorry, I...

1140
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:25,202
For what?

1141
00:58:27,437 --> 00:58:29,774
I just kissed you, and I...
No, honey.

1142
00:58:30,575 --> 00:58:32,042
I kissed you.

1143
00:58:39,149 --> 00:58:40,685
Mmm.

1144
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:43,320
I know that one
was me.

1145
00:58:44,321 --> 00:58:46,190
Try not to keep score.

1146
00:58:56,701 --> 00:58:58,435
Soft lips.

1147
00:58:58,502 --> 00:59:00,971
I'm so glad
they still work.

1148
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:04,374
I haven't used them for
kissing in such a long time.

1149
00:59:04,441 --> 00:59:06,611
More like for, you know,
wearing lipstick

1150
00:59:06,677 --> 00:59:09,113
and whistling and...

1151
00:59:09,179 --> 00:59:10,648
Mmm!

1152
00:59:25,229 --> 00:59:27,497
Well, well.

1153
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,967
Now look who's got
something that works.

1154
00:59:30,034 --> 00:59:32,436
And you didn't even
take any Viagra...

1155
00:59:32,502 --> 00:59:34,839
Kiss me before
you make it go away.

1156
00:59:49,687 --> 00:59:52,289
This could be world-class
interesting.

1157
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,260
Having any doubts?

1158
00:59:58,395 --> 00:59:59,463
Yes.

1159
01:00:00,397 --> 01:00:01,598
Me too.

1160
01:00:03,367 --> 01:00:05,035
But so far

1161
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:07,938
the kissing
is spectacular.

1162
01:00:09,273 --> 01:00:12,710
I'm not grading you, I'm just mentioning it.
Like...

1163
01:00:12,777 --> 01:00:14,044
Like, brilliant.

1164
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,931
I can't get past
your damn turtleneck.

1165
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:44,174
Cut it off. Please.

1166
01:00:45,009 --> 01:00:46,210
Please!

1167
01:00:47,411 --> 01:00:49,246
Cut it off.

1168
01:00:49,313 --> 01:00:50,514
Please.

1169
01:00:53,417 --> 01:00:56,220
Aren't you full of surprises?
Yeah.

1170
01:01:04,929 --> 01:01:06,296
Yeah.

1171
01:01:11,802 --> 01:01:12,870
Yes.

1172
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:19,810
You're beautiful.

1173
01:01:21,611 --> 01:01:23,680
Open your eyes
so I know you hear me.

1174
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:27,484
Beautiful.

1175
01:01:45,335 --> 01:01:46,670
What about birth control?

1176
01:01:47,838 --> 01:01:49,173
Menopause.

1177
01:01:50,507 --> 01:01:52,076
Who's the lucky boy?

1178
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:59,149
Okay. Okay.

1179
01:02:14,765 --> 01:02:16,566
I think we should take
your blood pressure.

1180
01:02:17,868 --> 01:02:19,536
My blood pressure?

1181
01:02:19,603 --> 01:02:21,238
I think it's
irresponsible not to.

1182
01:02:25,309 --> 01:02:28,578
Nobody but you would stop...
Yeah, so you're lucky.

1183
01:02:30,114 --> 01:02:32,516
Oh, God, I can't...
I can't see.

1184
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,084
My glasses.
Okay.

1185
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:40,791
120/80! Oh, baby!

1186
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:49,666
Oh, my God.

1187
01:02:50,167 --> 01:02:52,569
I do like sex.

1188
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:58,142
You certainly do.

1189
01:02:58,208 --> 01:03:00,144
Wow!

1190
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:02,379
Oh, God.

1191
01:03:05,749 --> 01:03:09,653
So this is what you're supposed
to do on a rainy afternoon, huh?

1192
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,663
I really thought I was

1193
01:03:20,898 --> 01:03:23,233
sort of closed up
for business.

1194
01:03:24,902 --> 01:03:26,770
I never expected this.

1195
01:03:37,915 --> 01:03:40,250
Nothing's ever
surprised me more.

1196
01:03:45,355 --> 01:03:46,857
This is crazy.

1197
01:03:49,693 --> 01:03:52,629
I can't remember
the last time I cried. I...

1198
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:56,633
I think I'm overwhelmed.

1199
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:02,873
Me too.

1200
01:04:04,541 --> 01:04:06,510
That's the perfect word.

1201
01:04:07,444 --> 01:04:09,779
Baby, I had sex three days

1202
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:12,416
after a heart attack,
and I didn't die.

1203
01:04:12,482 --> 01:04:15,119
That's gotta be
some kind of a record.

1204
01:04:17,054 --> 01:04:18,155
Yeah.

1205
01:04:24,028 --> 01:04:27,297
Let's just not brag about
this to your doctor, okay?

1206
01:04:29,433 --> 01:04:31,535
Honey.

1207
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:35,539
I may not be many things,
but one thing I am is discreet.

1208
01:04:35,605 --> 01:04:36,706
Yeah.

1209
01:04:40,444 --> 01:04:42,279
Erica?
Hm?

1210
01:04:44,281 --> 01:04:45,449
Erica.

1211
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:47,351
Yeah?

1212
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:50,787
Erica?

1213
01:04:52,689 --> 01:04:55,892
You know I'm not good
at being monogamous, right?

1214
01:04:57,627 --> 01:04:59,796
Monogamous?

1215
01:04:59,863 --> 01:05:02,766
Please.
I hardly know you.

1216
01:05:25,455 --> 01:05:27,291
But why Paris?

1217
01:05:27,357 --> 01:05:30,227
I just always wanted to write
a play that ended there.

1218
01:05:30,294 --> 01:05:32,196
People need romance
like that,

1219
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:33,563
and if someone
like me doesn't write it

1220
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:35,765
where are they gonna
get it? Real life?

1221
01:05:35,832 --> 01:05:37,167
Excuse me?

1222
01:05:38,402 --> 01:05:40,837
What do you call this?

1223
01:05:40,904 --> 01:05:43,440
Eating eggs
by candlelight,

1224
01:05:43,507 --> 01:05:44,975
in our robes,

1225
01:05:46,076 --> 01:05:47,477
after, uh...

1226
01:05:48,912 --> 01:05:50,414
Sorry.

1227
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,182
So where do you like
to eat in Paris?

1228
01:05:52,249 --> 01:05:55,652
Oh, I love this bistro
called The Grand Colbert.

1229
01:05:55,719 --> 01:05:56,886
It's behind
the Palais-Royal.

1230
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:59,856
It's the best roast chicken
in the universe.

1231
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:04,394
You'd be fun
to go to Paris with.

1232
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:07,264
It is the best city
to stay up all night in.

1233
01:06:07,331 --> 01:06:09,366
Hey, when is
your birthday?

1234
01:06:10,567 --> 01:06:12,969
February.
Well, mine's January.

1235
01:06:13,037 --> 01:06:14,438
So how about
if we still know each other

1236
01:06:14,504 --> 01:06:16,540
by then, we go to Paris

1237
01:06:16,606 --> 01:06:18,275
for our birthdays,
huh?

1238
01:06:19,243 --> 01:06:20,410
Maybe.

1239
01:06:24,748 --> 01:06:26,150
You just said...
You know something,

1240
01:06:26,216 --> 01:06:28,218
I have no idea
how to do this.

1241
01:06:28,285 --> 01:06:32,589
I don't know how to be
intimate but not intimate. Oy.

1242
01:06:35,092 --> 01:06:39,863
The color is draining
from your face.

1243
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:43,900
Okay, I'm gonna pee, take one
of your blood-pressure pills

1244
01:06:43,967 --> 01:06:46,136
and when I get back,
let's not talk anymore.

1245
01:06:46,203 --> 01:06:47,437
Oh, God!

1246
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:51,508
Erica.

1247
01:06:52,876 --> 01:06:56,080
You're the funniest girl
I ever had sex with.

1248
01:06:58,648 --> 01:07:01,151
Well, that's something.

1249
01:07:01,885 --> 01:07:03,287
Honey...

1250
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:04,854
Hm?

1251
01:07:04,921 --> 01:07:07,824
I think I should
go back to my room.

1252
01:07:07,891 --> 01:07:10,327
Let you get some sleep.
Let me sleep?

1253
01:07:10,927 --> 01:07:12,028
Yeah.

1254
01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:16,133
Right.

1255
01:07:17,167 --> 01:07:18,502
You usually send
the girls home.

1256
01:07:21,738 --> 01:07:23,473
But I am home.

1257
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:25,075
Okay.

1258
01:07:25,142 --> 01:07:27,244
Well, I'm an old dog,
you know?

1259
01:07:27,311 --> 01:07:28,378
Hey.

1260
01:07:29,813 --> 01:07:32,282
It's perfectly...
Whatever.

1261
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:42,058
This was...

1262
01:07:45,829 --> 01:07:47,297
This was a...

1263
01:07:48,732 --> 01:07:50,234
great night...

1264
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:53,203
for me.

1265
01:07:58,242 --> 01:07:59,943
Me too.

1266
01:08:00,009 --> 01:08:01,111
Yeah?

1267
01:08:02,879 --> 01:08:04,348
At one point,

1268
01:08:05,782 --> 01:08:07,417
I even thought...

1269
01:08:11,221 --> 01:08:12,456
soul mates.

1270
01:08:21,798 --> 01:08:23,167
Good night.

1271
01:08:51,895 --> 01:08:53,630
Oh...

1272
01:09:06,876 --> 01:09:07,911
Hm?

1273
01:09:13,283 --> 01:09:15,719
I'd like to try
sleeping with you.

1274
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:18,582
Oh, my God!

1275
01:10:22,552 --> 01:10:23,620
Hi.

1276
01:10:26,423 --> 01:10:28,592
What time
do you think it is?

1277
01:10:39,303 --> 01:10:42,005
Can you see this?

1278
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:44,441
Not really.
It looks like it says

1279
01:10:45,842 --> 01:10:46,876
11:00?

1280
01:10:51,881 --> 01:10:54,083
It is 11:00.
It is?

1281
01:10:54,150 --> 01:10:57,220
No way. It can't be.

1282
01:10:57,287 --> 01:10:59,456
Oh, my God, that would mean
we slept eight hours?

1283
01:11:03,493 --> 01:11:05,929
Impossible.
Yeah.

1284
01:11:07,631 --> 01:11:08,998
Oh, Nellie.

1285
01:11:11,668 --> 01:11:13,503
A little dizzy.

1286
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:16,340
Oh, no. Okay,
now, you just...

1287
01:11:16,406 --> 01:11:19,776
You just stay still. Here.
Here's the clicker.

1288
01:11:19,843 --> 01:11:22,211
You know you have a doctor's
appointment in an hour.

1289
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:24,714
I'll make us some coffee,
get you your pills

1290
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:26,215
whip us up
some French toast.

1291
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:29,152
I have the best
maple syrup ever.

1292
01:11:31,054 --> 01:11:32,221
Erica.

1293
01:11:32,756 --> 01:11:33,823
Huh?

1294
01:11:34,991 --> 01:11:37,561
You are a woman to love.

1295
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:52,409
"You are..."

1296
01:11:52,476 --> 01:11:55,011
"You are a woman to love."

1297
01:11:56,513 --> 01:11:58,181
What the hell does
that mean?

1298
01:11:59,949 --> 01:12:02,586
Okay, buddy, your echo
looks real good.

1299
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:07,123
I'm sending you
back to the city.

1300
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:09,693
Past few days
have done wonders for you.

1301
01:12:09,759 --> 01:12:12,929
Yeah, I've been working
on that stair thing.

1302
01:12:14,297 --> 01:12:15,999
I can do it,
by the way.

1303
01:12:16,065 --> 01:12:17,300
Do what?

1304
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:20,169
Climb a flight
of stairs.

1305
01:12:21,137 --> 01:12:23,039
Several times,
actually.

1306
01:12:23,673 --> 01:12:25,008
Way to go.

1307
01:12:26,309 --> 01:12:28,812
So, uh, how's Erica?

1308
01:12:29,546 --> 01:12:30,780
Erica, as it turns out

1309
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:34,484
is an amazing woman.

1310
01:12:34,551 --> 01:12:36,953
She's just...
Well, that's wonderful.

1311
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:39,122
I think she's wonderful.

1312
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:41,324
I think she's wonderful too.

1313
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:45,094
Give her my best.

1314
01:12:52,502 --> 01:12:53,703
Julian?

1315
01:12:54,971 --> 01:12:56,372
Thank you...

1316
01:12:57,574 --> 01:12:59,108
for everything.

1317
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:04,948
You're gonna be okay.

1318
01:13:07,083 --> 01:13:08,184
I am?

1319
01:13:09,919 --> 01:13:12,155
This is the second time
I've done this.

1320
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:15,992
I get overcome or something.
It's so out of the blue.

1321
01:13:17,561 --> 01:13:19,496
It's common
to become emotional

1322
01:13:19,563 --> 01:13:21,297
after having an episode
like you've had.

1323
01:13:22,198 --> 01:13:24,300
Everything takes on
a new meaning.

1324
01:13:24,367 --> 01:13:27,370
So it's not crazy for a guy
to do something

1325
01:13:27,437 --> 01:13:32,809
so totally out of character
after having a heart attack.

1326
01:13:32,876 --> 01:13:34,578
You mean like crying?

1327
01:13:34,644 --> 01:13:35,745
Yeah.

1328
01:13:37,681 --> 01:13:39,716
And completely
changing their taste.

1329
01:13:40,784 --> 01:13:42,686
Like, suddenly...

1330
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:45,388
really liking something
that you never thought

1331
01:13:45,455 --> 01:13:47,457
that you could ever like.

1332
01:13:48,291 --> 01:13:49,392
Ever.

1333
01:13:50,827 --> 01:13:52,228
It's unnerving.

1334
01:13:52,295 --> 01:13:54,864
I think you can expect just
about anything right now.

1335
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:56,265
People have done
some wild things

1336
01:13:56,332 --> 01:13:58,101
after having
a heart attack.

1337
01:13:58,167 --> 01:14:01,270
But most people go back
to being themselves, right?

1338
01:14:01,337 --> 01:14:03,673
I'm gonna go back
to being me...

1339
01:14:05,208 --> 01:14:06,476
aren't I?

1340
01:14:07,477 --> 01:14:08,812
We'll see.

1341
01:14:22,692 --> 01:14:23,860
Here you go.

1342
01:14:23,927 --> 01:14:25,829
You can have
these back now.

1343
01:14:25,895 --> 01:14:28,798
I confiscated them
on your first night here.

1344
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:34,671
Thank you, darling.
Try not to smoke them.

1345
01:14:36,105 --> 01:14:37,707
And I packed you
a sandwich,

1346
01:14:37,774 --> 01:14:39,643
just in case
your blood sugar got low

1347
01:14:39,709 --> 01:14:41,044
and some of that
ice tea you like,

1348
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:43,913
and a non-fat,
low-cholesterol cookie and a peach.

1349
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,381
What a doll.

1350
01:14:48,685 --> 01:14:50,419
Got something else?

1351
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:53,489
Something to
remember me by.

1352
01:15:17,146 --> 01:15:19,182
There is that.
And, hey...

1353
01:15:20,016 --> 01:15:21,317
we'll always have Paris.

1354
01:15:24,921 --> 01:15:26,055
Bad joke.

1355
01:15:26,122 --> 01:15:27,857
Honey?
Yeah?

1356
01:15:30,259 --> 01:15:33,462
No words can ever
express my gratitude

1357
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:36,966
for taking me in

1358
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:40,837
and taking care
of me and...

1359
01:15:40,904 --> 01:15:42,706
Hey. Your heart attack

1360
01:15:42,772 --> 01:15:45,341
could be the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1361
01:15:52,515 --> 01:15:54,851
I love ya.
I love you too.

1362
01:15:56,285 --> 01:15:57,887
If that's what you said.

1363
01:15:57,954 --> 01:15:59,222
I don't know if
it ends in a "ya"

1364
01:15:59,288 --> 01:16:00,790
if it's an official
"I love you," but...

1365
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,995
You're not
like anybody.

1366
01:16:28,652 --> 01:16:30,854
I knew you'd call.
Who? It's me.

1367
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,622
What's wrong?
I had breakfast with Dad this morning

1368
01:16:32,689 --> 01:16:35,091
and we're talking,
and he starts looking all weird

1369
01:16:35,158 --> 01:16:36,660
and then he tells me

1370
01:16:36,726 --> 01:16:39,328
he met someone three weeks ago,
that it's really something.

1371
01:16:39,395 --> 01:16:40,964
And then he...

1372
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:43,733
He tells me
he's getting married.

1373
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:46,602
Why am I reacting this way?
I'm almost 30 years old.

1374
01:16:46,670 --> 01:16:49,072
Wait, wait. Who is he marrying?
I don't know.

1375
01:16:49,138 --> 01:16:51,140
Some chick he met
three weeks ago.

1376
01:16:51,207 --> 01:16:53,109
She's two years
older than me.

1377
01:16:53,176 --> 01:16:57,480
She's an ear, nose and throat doctor.
Has he lost his mind?

1378
01:16:57,546 --> 01:16:59,182
Honey...

1379
01:16:59,248 --> 01:17:00,750
I have this huge auction
tonight and I'm really upset.

1380
01:17:00,817 --> 01:17:02,919
My shrink's away
for two weeks.

1381
01:17:02,986 --> 01:17:06,455
Can you come in?
I know you're working, but just, please?

1382
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:13,663
Look, I get that he has
a right to get remarried,

1383
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:15,231
but he doesn't
even know her.

1384
01:17:15,298 --> 01:17:17,466
And she's like my age.
Do you know what that's like?

1385
01:17:17,533 --> 01:17:19,435
That's, like,
beyond creepy.

1386
01:17:19,502 --> 01:17:22,505
It's not like I think he's replacing me.
I know he isn't.

1387
01:17:22,571 --> 01:17:25,108
And I know I'm too old
to act like this, it's nuts.

1388
01:17:25,174 --> 01:17:27,076
First of all,
please don't smoke.

1389
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:29,946
If he is replacing anyone,
it's me, not you.

1390
01:17:30,013 --> 01:17:33,549
And all the statistics say that
divorced men almost always remarry.

1391
01:17:33,616 --> 01:17:35,418
It's just the way
they're built.

1392
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:36,786
Wanna know the answer to
the big mystery of my life?

1393
01:17:36,853 --> 01:17:38,387
Why I'm always
with the wrong guy?

1394
01:17:38,454 --> 01:17:40,790
This is why.
Because the wrong guy can't do this to you.

1395
01:17:40,857 --> 01:17:44,093
This is my big fear,
that some guy can get me

1396
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:47,296
unglued like this.
And this is just Dad!

1397
01:17:47,363 --> 01:17:48,798
We know this about me.

1398
01:17:48,865 --> 01:17:51,735
I am just not cut out
for this kind of drama.

1399
01:17:51,801 --> 01:17:54,270
I think it's the drama in
life that makes you strong.

1400
01:17:54,337 --> 01:17:56,572
You always say things
to me like this.

1401
01:17:56,639 --> 01:18:00,343
You never understand that
everyone isn't like you.

1402
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:01,711
Well...

1403
01:18:01,778 --> 01:18:03,412
You know, I'm sorry,
but if I were you,

1404
01:18:03,479 --> 01:18:04,547
and my ex-husband,
the man I still allow to direct

1405
01:18:04,613 --> 01:18:06,282
all my plays,
were getting remarried

1406
01:18:06,349 --> 01:18:09,819
to some 33-year-old ear,
nose and throat babe,

1407
01:18:09,886 --> 01:18:12,588
I'd be bonkers.
And look at you.

1408
01:18:12,655 --> 01:18:14,223
You never looked better,
by the way.

1409
01:18:14,290 --> 01:18:15,491
Oh, well...

1410
01:18:16,826 --> 01:18:18,627
Marin, we're all set.

1411
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:21,364
I gotta go sell $40 million
worth of art.

1412
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:23,066
Mom, can you do one other
really big thing for me?

1413
01:18:23,132 --> 01:18:24,801
Just say yes, just...

1414
01:18:24,868 --> 01:18:27,070
Please?
Anything, bubby.

1415
01:18:27,136 --> 01:18:28,637
I need you to come
out to dinner tonight

1416
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:30,774
with me,
Dad and the fiancee.

1417
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:33,609
Absolutely not. No.
Mom, you have to.

1418
01:18:33,676 --> 01:18:35,511
Hey. You have to.

1419
01:18:35,578 --> 01:18:38,047
Yes, because he wants me to meet her.
I can't go alone.

1420
01:18:38,114 --> 01:18:39,515
I already asked them
if you could come,

1421
01:18:39,582 --> 01:18:41,885
and he said it'd be fine.
And she said it was fine.

1422
01:18:41,951 --> 01:18:43,419
You're gonna have
to meet her too anyway,

1423
01:18:43,486 --> 01:18:44,921
so we might as well
do it together.

1424
01:18:44,988 --> 01:18:47,490
Come on. Please?

1425
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:49,592
You know
you can handle it.

1426
01:18:50,226 --> 01:18:52,428
Well...

1427
01:18:52,495 --> 01:18:55,899
Okay, that's it.
You see that look on your face?

1428
01:18:55,965 --> 01:18:59,002
That's the gene
I didn't get.

1429
01:18:59,068 --> 01:19:00,603
Good evening,
and welcome to Christie's

1430
01:19:00,669 --> 01:19:03,506
and this evening's sale of
impressionist and modern art.

1431
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:05,374
Bidders should know the
auctioneer may open bidding

1432
01:19:05,441 --> 01:19:06,876
on any lot
below the reserve

1433
01:19:06,943 --> 01:19:09,078
by placing a bid
on behalf of the seller.

1434
01:19:09,145 --> 01:19:10,746
Okay, let's start
with lot number one

1435
01:19:10,814 --> 01:19:12,481
the Renard, showing here.

1436
01:19:12,548 --> 01:19:15,318
and $80,000 is bid
with my absent bidder.

1437
01:19:15,384 --> 01:19:19,388
$85,000, gentleman's bid.
$90,000, still with me.

1438
01:19:19,455 --> 01:19:22,225
$100,000. $110,000.

1439
01:19:22,291 --> 01:19:25,661
$120,000. $130,000.

1440
01:19:25,728 --> 01:19:29,332
$140,000, gentleman's bid.
And fair warning.

1441
01:19:41,744 --> 01:19:43,179
Guess I got stood up.

1442
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:46,382
Would you like
to order or...?

1443
01:19:46,449 --> 01:19:49,652
Why not? I put the tie on
and everything.

1444
01:19:49,718 --> 01:19:50,887
And can you
bring me another?

1445
01:20:00,864 --> 01:20:02,365
Your drink, ma'am.

1446
01:20:02,431 --> 01:20:03,967
Oh, good.
Thank you so much.

1447
01:20:04,868 --> 01:20:06,335
So delicious.

1448
01:20:09,738 --> 01:20:11,841
Thirsty?
I've had a very big week, Dave.

1449
01:20:11,908 --> 01:20:14,810
I forgot how these slip
right down. I'm fine.

1450
01:20:14,878 --> 01:20:17,780
So, Kristen, where did you
go to medical...

1451
01:20:19,048 --> 01:20:21,684
School?
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1452
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:23,519
University of Pennsylvania.

1453
01:20:23,586 --> 01:20:26,655
Oh, well, actually,
I went to school in Philadelphia too.

1454
01:20:26,722 --> 01:20:28,757
Yeah, a Bryn Mawr girl.
You're kidding.

1455
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:31,194
My mom went to Bryn Mawr.
Wow!

1456
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:32,828
So not only are you
marrying my father,

1457
01:20:32,896 --> 01:20:34,864
but our mothers went
to the same college.

1458
01:20:34,931 --> 01:20:37,400
Shall we order?
Absolutely.

1459
01:20:37,466 --> 01:20:39,168
Erica? Do I like duck?

1460
01:20:39,235 --> 01:20:41,170
Yes, it's rabbit you hate.

1461
01:20:41,237 --> 01:20:43,973
I'll give you the list of
everything he likes and dislikes.

1462
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:46,142
Let's let her figure some
things out for herself.

1463
01:20:46,209 --> 01:20:47,643
Oh, I'm not talking
about that, Dave.

1464
01:20:47,710 --> 01:20:49,879
After all, she did go
to medical school.

1465
01:20:49,946 --> 01:20:51,780
Hey, hey, hey.
Not in front of the kids.

1466
01:20:54,884 --> 01:20:57,253
So, what do you see
that you like?

1467
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:58,821
What are you having?

1468
01:20:58,888 --> 01:21:00,323
I don't know.

1469
01:21:00,389 --> 01:21:02,625
You know, I'm looking
at the grilled salmon...

1470
01:21:09,899 --> 01:21:12,101
Who would like what?
Mom, are you okay?

1471
01:21:12,168 --> 01:21:13,436
Huh?

1472
01:21:13,502 --> 01:21:14,803
Sure you're okay?
Yeah, no, I'm fine. I'm...

1473
01:21:18,407 --> 01:21:20,009
I'm fine.
You sure?

1474
01:21:20,076 --> 01:21:21,577
Oh, yes.
Good.

1475
01:21:21,644 --> 01:21:23,012
Okay...

1476
01:21:23,079 --> 01:21:25,848
If we order the pasta,
we could get the fresh rigatoni.

1477
01:21:25,915 --> 01:21:28,551
Grilled free-range chicken
teriyaki...

1478
01:21:29,818 --> 01:21:32,288
I'm not sure.
What about you?

1479
01:21:32,989 --> 01:21:34,557
Uh...

1480
01:21:34,623 --> 01:21:36,425
I'm sorry.
Maybe I need a little air.

1481
01:21:36,492 --> 01:21:38,694
Are you okay? Fine.
I'll be right back.

1482
01:21:42,098 --> 01:21:43,432
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.

1483
01:21:44,667 --> 01:21:45,901
I, uh...

1484
01:21:48,837 --> 01:21:50,706
Hey!
Hello, Harry.

1485
01:21:52,541 --> 01:21:53,576
Hi.

1486
01:21:56,379 --> 01:21:58,881
Hi. I don't know
if you know...

1487
01:22:09,825 --> 01:22:12,395
God, I'm so stupid.

1488
01:22:15,831 --> 01:22:18,267
What?
Erica!

1489
01:22:18,334 --> 01:22:20,936
Harry, I gotta go.
Slow down!

1490
01:22:21,004 --> 01:22:22,671
You wanna kill me?

1491
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:25,441
Taxi.

1492
01:22:26,109 --> 01:22:27,876
Erica.

1493
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:30,146
She's just a friend.
Oh, yeah.

1494
01:22:30,213 --> 01:22:31,747
She looks like a real
buddy kind of girl.

1495
01:22:31,814 --> 01:22:33,382
Come on.

1496
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:35,518
Just a dinner.
Harry, look.

1497
01:22:36,485 --> 01:22:38,221
Here's the problem.

1498
01:22:39,688 --> 01:22:43,159
I really like you.

1499
01:22:43,226 --> 01:22:45,028
Yeah, but I "love you"
like you.

1500
01:22:45,094 --> 01:22:46,729
I do, I love you.

1501
01:23:00,843 --> 01:23:04,013
I think that
we should consider

1502
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,515
maybe we're getting a little
ahead of ourselves.

1503
01:23:06,582 --> 01:23:08,417
Do you?
Yeah.

1504
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:10,853
You know,
I am like the dumb girl who doesn't get it.

1505
01:23:10,919 --> 01:23:13,356
I've never been the dumb girl before.
It ain't so great.

1506
01:23:13,422 --> 01:23:15,258
Let's just calm down.

1507
01:23:15,324 --> 01:23:18,361
I had these plans
before I even met you.

1508
01:23:18,427 --> 01:23:20,363
I mean, I do like
seeing you. I do.

1509
01:23:20,429 --> 01:23:21,730
Oh, yeah.

1510
01:23:21,797 --> 01:23:24,400
And I'm always surprised by it.
Surprised by it?

1511
01:23:25,234 --> 01:23:27,470
What was I thinking?

1512
01:23:27,536 --> 01:23:30,239
I have never
lied to you.

1513
01:23:30,306 --> 01:23:34,477
I have always told you
some version of the truth.

1514
01:23:34,543 --> 01:23:37,346
The truth doesn't
have versions, okay?

1515
01:23:37,413 --> 01:23:40,549
Will you cut me
a little slack?

1516
01:23:40,616 --> 01:23:42,918
My life has just
been turned upside down.

1517
01:23:42,985 --> 01:23:44,353
Mine too!

1518
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:46,255
Well, then let's just
each get our bearings.

1519
01:23:46,322 --> 01:23:48,224
I don't want my bearings.

1520
01:23:48,291 --> 01:23:52,528
I've had my bearings
my whole goddamn life.

1521
01:23:52,595 --> 01:23:53,829
I felt something
with you

1522
01:23:53,896 --> 01:23:56,299
that I never
really knew existed.

1523
01:23:56,365 --> 01:23:59,468
Do you know what that's like,
after a 20-year marriage

1524
01:23:59,535 --> 01:24:02,338
to feel something for another
person that is so...?

1525
01:24:03,306 --> 01:24:04,507
That...

1526
01:24:06,275 --> 01:24:09,645
Oh, right. Right.
Not your problem.

1527
01:24:09,712 --> 01:24:12,115
God. Do you know that
I've written this,

1528
01:24:12,181 --> 01:24:15,084
but I never really got it.

1529
01:24:16,952 --> 01:24:18,321
Do you know
what this is?

1530
01:24:19,355 --> 01:24:20,389
No.

1531
01:24:31,734 --> 01:24:35,003
This is heartbroken.
How's that for impervious, huh?

1532
01:24:35,804 --> 01:24:38,507
You're killing me.

1533
01:24:38,574 --> 01:24:41,944
I just wish that it had
lasted more than a week.

1534
01:24:43,779 --> 01:24:44,980
Me too.

1535
01:24:48,117 --> 01:24:50,553
That is a terrible
thing to say.

1536
01:24:52,054 --> 01:24:55,391
You know, the life
I had before you

1537
01:24:55,458 --> 01:24:58,627
I knew how to do that.
I could do that forever.

1538
01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:03,432
But now look at me.
What am I gonna do?

1539
01:25:03,499 --> 01:25:04,767
What am I gonna do
with all this?

1540
01:25:07,803 --> 01:25:09,572
Taxi.

1541
01:25:09,638 --> 01:25:12,375
Erica. Can you wait
just a second?

1542
01:25:13,576 --> 01:25:16,512
The truth is, I...
I just...

1543
01:25:18,013 --> 01:25:20,449
I don't know how
to be a boyfriend.

1544
01:25:22,084 --> 01:25:24,019
That's what you have to say
after all of this?

1545
01:25:24,086 --> 01:25:26,522
That you don't know how
to be a boyfriend?

1546
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:30,125
That's not a small thing.

1547
01:25:33,696 --> 01:25:35,097
Are we done?

1548
01:25:36,399 --> 01:25:37,866
I don't know.

1549
01:25:41,003 --> 01:25:42,371
Oh, my God.

1550
01:25:50,213 --> 01:25:51,447
Ouch.

1551
01:25:53,716 --> 01:25:55,384
Oh, my God.

1552
01:25:56,485 --> 01:25:58,954
Came in by a cab.

1553
01:25:59,021 --> 01:26:00,956
Vital signs are stable.
Respiratory is on its way.

1554
01:26:01,023 --> 01:26:02,591
You know the victim?

1555
01:26:02,658 --> 01:26:05,294
15 minutes of chest pains,
hospitalized a week ago with an MI.

1556
01:26:05,361 --> 01:26:08,030
Switch over to monitors.
Hang a nitro drip.

1557
01:26:08,096 --> 01:26:09,432
You can't.

1558
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:13,902
I took Viagra.

1559
01:26:13,969 --> 01:26:16,004
You have been through this before.
Yeah.

1560
01:26:16,071 --> 01:26:19,442
Let's run a 12-lead EKG.
You having chest pain right now?

1561
01:26:19,508 --> 01:26:23,712
No. And the pain
I was having was sharp...

1562
01:26:23,779 --> 01:26:25,180
not like before.
That's good.

1563
01:26:25,248 --> 01:26:27,250
"Not like before"
is what we like to hear.

1564
01:26:27,316 --> 01:26:30,152
I was really out of breath

1565
01:26:30,219 --> 01:26:32,588
like I couldn't catch it.

1566
01:26:32,655 --> 01:26:35,991
Okay. Give him an aspirin,
and let's run a blood gas.

1567
01:26:36,058 --> 01:26:38,961
Mr. Sanborn,
what were you doing at the onset of the pain?

1568
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:42,130
Having a fight
with someone. A woman.

1569
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:43,732
Can a woman give
you chest pains?

1570
01:26:43,799 --> 01:26:45,167
Are you kidding?

1571
01:26:45,234 --> 01:26:48,337
Love hurts, haven't you heard?
I've heard.

1572
01:26:48,404 --> 01:26:50,673
I just never personally
experienced it.

1573
01:26:50,739 --> 01:26:53,542
Well, you've been lucky.
Yeah. Lucky.

1574
01:26:53,609 --> 01:26:56,612
All right. Your EKG
looks perfectly normal.

1575
01:26:56,679 --> 01:26:59,014
Your heart rate's good.
The pain you described.

1576
01:26:59,081 --> 01:27:01,284
is not the kind of pain that
we generally worry about.

1577
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:04,119
I think what you experienced
was hyperventilation

1578
01:27:04,186 --> 01:27:05,721
brought on by stress.

1579
01:27:07,356 --> 01:27:09,825
Stress?
And in case you haven't heard,

1580
01:27:09,892 --> 01:27:12,261
stress can give you
a heart attack.

1581
01:27:12,328 --> 01:27:13,962
Mr. Sanborn,
I have no idea what you're up to,

1582
01:27:14,029 --> 01:27:15,698
gallivanting out
and about at this hour

1583
01:27:15,764 --> 01:27:18,434
one week after
having a heart attack

1584
01:27:18,501 --> 01:27:21,904
but if you were my dad,
I would have you home in bed

1585
01:27:21,970 --> 01:27:23,439
recuperating.

1586
01:27:32,581 --> 01:27:34,550
"If you were my dad..."

1587
01:28:27,370 --> 01:28:30,906
Hi, it's Erica.
I'm not here, so leave me a message.

1588
01:28:43,519 --> 01:28:44,887
Ouch.

1589
01:29:02,204 --> 01:29:04,607
You have one new message.

1590
01:29:04,673 --> 01:29:05,908
Message one.

1591
01:29:05,974 --> 01:29:09,478
Erica, hi, it's Julian.
I'm in the restaurant

1592
01:29:09,545 --> 01:29:11,614
and I'm just wondering
if you're on your way.

1593
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,416
It's about 8:20.

1594
01:29:13,482 --> 01:29:16,184
It's a lovely night
out here. It's a nice...

1595
01:30:56,018 --> 01:30:57,252
Oh, my...

1596
01:31:07,362 --> 01:31:08,531
Mm-hm.

1597
01:31:26,148 --> 01:31:27,750
Yeah, go figure.

1598
01:32:47,062 --> 01:32:48,130
Zoe!

1599
01:32:50,465 --> 01:32:52,300
Hey, Mom, we're going
into town.

1600
01:32:52,367 --> 01:32:53,902
Okay.

1601
01:32:53,969 --> 01:32:55,503
Are you crying?

1602
01:32:58,974 --> 01:33:00,075
Yeah.

1603
01:33:00,909 --> 01:33:02,878
It's my new thing.

1604
01:33:02,945 --> 01:33:04,747
I've gotten abnormally
brilliant at it.

1605
01:33:04,813 --> 01:33:06,148
Why? What is it?

1606
01:33:11,219 --> 01:33:12,354
I'm in love.

1607
01:33:13,722 --> 01:33:15,257
Ain't it great?

1608
01:33:16,759 --> 01:33:19,995
Seems like I gotta learn
how to do that

1609
01:33:20,062 --> 01:33:22,497
love-them-and-leave-them
stuff, you know?

1610
01:33:22,564 --> 01:33:24,933
Oh, Mom, I hate this.

1611
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,534
Now do you get my theory
about all this?

1612
01:33:26,601 --> 01:33:28,536
You gotta self-protect.

1613
01:33:28,603 --> 01:33:31,206
You don't really buy this stuff you say,
do you?

1614
01:33:31,273 --> 01:33:35,911
You don't actually think that
you can outsmart getting hurt?

1615
01:33:36,879 --> 01:33:38,647
I think it's worth trying.

1616
01:33:38,714 --> 01:33:41,116
Listen to me.

1617
01:33:41,183 --> 01:33:43,919
You can't hide from love
for the rest of your life

1618
01:33:43,986 --> 01:33:46,689
because maybe
it won't work out

1619
01:33:46,755 --> 01:33:49,191
maybe you'll
become unglued?

1620
01:33:49,257 --> 01:33:50,993
It's just not
a way to live.

1621
01:33:51,059 --> 01:33:53,896
Are you telling me this is
good what's happened to you?

1622
01:33:53,962 --> 01:33:58,400
I think you should consider
the possibility...

1623
01:33:58,466 --> 01:34:01,503
that you and I are more
alike than you realize.

1624
01:34:04,072 --> 01:34:07,575
I let someone in,
and I had the time of my life.

1625
01:34:11,747 --> 01:34:13,749
I've never had
the time of my life.

1626
01:34:13,816 --> 01:34:15,283
I know, baby.

1627
01:34:16,518 --> 01:34:18,020
And I say this

1628
01:34:19,587 --> 01:34:21,990
from the deepest
part of my heart.

1629
01:34:22,057 --> 01:34:24,059
What are you waiting for?

1630
01:34:42,945 --> 01:34:44,679
Hey!
Harry, great party.

1631
01:34:44,747 --> 01:34:46,749
Thank you.
My pleasure.

1632
01:34:51,086 --> 01:34:53,421
Hey, hi.
Hey, good to see you.

1633
01:34:54,957 --> 01:34:56,524
You having fun?

1634
01:34:57,425 --> 01:34:58,894
Not quite.

1635
01:35:56,751 --> 01:35:58,520
I got you something great
at the farm stand.

1636
01:36:05,660 --> 01:36:07,996
These are for you to give
me when you apologize.

1637
01:36:09,531 --> 01:36:12,000
* Sunday morning
Rain is falling *

1638
01:36:15,003 --> 01:36:19,241
* Clouds just shrouding us
In moments unforgettable *

1639
01:36:19,307 --> 01:36:23,979
* You twist to fit
The mold that I am in *

1640
01:36:24,046 --> 01:36:28,917
* That maybe all I leave

1641
01:36:28,984 --> 01:36:33,922
* In darkness
She is all I see *

1642
01:36:42,097 --> 01:36:46,001
Julian, I hope you know how
mortified I am by my behavior.

1643
01:36:46,068 --> 01:36:48,871
I was gonna get in touch
or send a note, something...

1644
01:36:48,937 --> 01:36:50,939
A note?
A note.

1645
01:36:51,006 --> 01:36:52,875
That's a little chilly.
Well...

1646
01:36:53,775 --> 01:36:55,343
I'm embarrassed.

1647
01:36:55,410 --> 01:36:58,246
I just haven't been myself
lately. What can I say?

1648
01:36:58,313 --> 01:37:00,015
Just tell me
you're sorry.

1649
01:37:00,883 --> 01:37:02,817
I am sorry.

1650
01:37:03,919 --> 01:37:05,253
Then you could kiss me.

1651
01:37:07,956 --> 01:37:09,224
Kiss you?

1652
01:37:14,196 --> 01:37:16,198
You're gonna forgive me
if I kiss you?

1653
01:37:16,264 --> 01:37:17,732
I think so.

1654
01:37:24,907 --> 01:37:27,609
No one on earth would
forgive you for that kiss.

1655
01:37:29,477 --> 01:37:30,645
May I?

1656
01:37:52,734 --> 01:37:54,069
I forgive you.

1657
01:38:22,830 --> 01:38:23,898
Yes!

1658
01:38:29,737 --> 01:38:31,206
It's the best thing
you've ever written.

1659
01:38:31,273 --> 01:38:32,340
It is?

1660
01:38:32,407 --> 01:38:33,841
It's wonderful.
It is?

1661
01:38:33,908 --> 01:38:36,578
Yes, it's sweet,
it's smart, it's funny...

1662
01:38:38,380 --> 01:38:39,781
How great is it
for you

1663
01:38:39,847 --> 01:38:42,417
that I'm not intimidated
by your brilliance?

1664
01:38:47,889 --> 01:38:50,258
Must we go through
this every time?

1665
01:38:50,325 --> 01:38:52,860
Come here. Come here.

1666
01:39:09,644 --> 01:39:11,779
Good. That's very good.

1667
01:39:11,846 --> 01:39:13,215
Anyway, you know
what I'm gonna do?

1668
01:39:13,281 --> 01:39:14,882
Oh. Oh, my God!

1669
01:39:21,523 --> 01:39:22,924
Oh, I gotta tell you.

1670
01:39:22,991 --> 01:39:26,128
I'm totally excited about this audition.
It's such a great part.

1671
01:39:26,194 --> 01:39:28,196
Supporting, but she's a really,
really funny character.

1672
01:39:28,263 --> 01:39:29,931
And there's this
totally hilarious scene

1673
01:39:29,998 --> 01:39:34,136
where she's dating this,
like, older chauvinistic guy.

1674
01:39:34,202 --> 01:39:36,238
Just as they're
about to do it, he moans.

1675
01:39:36,304 --> 01:39:39,941
And so she's just thinking that he's,
like, really into her

1676
01:39:40,008 --> 01:39:41,176
except he's having
a heart attack.

1677
01:39:43,145 --> 01:39:44,979
And she's, like,
totally creeped out

1678
01:39:45,047 --> 01:39:48,116
and her mom, who basically
despises the guy,

1679
01:39:48,183 --> 01:39:50,952
rushes in and gives him CPR
and saves his life.

1680
01:39:51,719 --> 01:39:53,755
Are you okay?

1681
01:39:53,821 --> 01:39:55,257
Isn't that funny?

1682
01:39:55,323 --> 01:39:58,560
Hold on, hold on.
Let's not get so dramatic here.

1683
01:39:58,626 --> 01:40:00,595
What are we,
four teenagers?

1684
01:40:00,662 --> 01:40:02,564
We're all
sophisticated people.

1685
01:40:02,630 --> 01:40:05,200
Why can't we all stay
for the weekend?

1686
01:40:05,267 --> 01:40:08,370
Your mother has work to do,
I've got papers to grade.

1687
01:40:08,436 --> 01:40:11,839
You do what you're going to do,
whatever that might be...

1688
01:40:11,906 --> 01:40:13,775
I need
to talk to you.

1689
01:40:13,841 --> 01:40:15,643
...together, and if
we don't, we don't.

1690
01:40:15,710 --> 01:40:17,179
Got a minute?

1691
01:40:20,848 --> 01:40:22,884
So your play
is about us?

1692
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:25,120
No, it's about me.
Am I in it?

1693
01:40:25,187 --> 01:40:28,223
Well, a guy like you
is in it, but he's not you.

1694
01:40:28,290 --> 01:40:31,059
What happens
to this guy who's not me?

1695
01:40:31,126 --> 01:40:33,761
I haven't totally decided.
He can...

1696
01:40:33,828 --> 01:40:36,731
He can live,
or he can die.

1697
01:40:37,899 --> 01:40:39,901
What are you leaning towards?
Death.

1698
01:40:41,869 --> 01:40:43,805
It's funnier.
Fine.

1699
01:40:43,871 --> 01:40:46,441
He dies
of a funny heart attack.

1700
01:40:46,508 --> 01:40:48,042
Well, he's sort
of a schmuck,

1701
01:40:48,110 --> 01:40:50,512
who screwed around with our heroine,
so it won't be too sad.

1702
01:40:50,578 --> 01:40:53,047
Schmucks are people too,
you know?

1703
01:40:53,115 --> 01:40:55,483
Death doesn't seem
a little harsh to you?

1704
01:40:55,550 --> 01:40:57,485
I went where
the story took me.

1705
01:40:57,552 --> 01:41:00,155
It's a work of fiction,
just stuff that I made up.

1706
01:41:00,222 --> 01:41:02,157
Erica?
Huh?

1707
01:41:02,224 --> 01:41:03,625
They're ready to do the hospital
"Do you take Viagra?" scene.

1708
01:41:04,759 --> 01:41:05,960
Should we wait for you?

1709
01:41:07,262 --> 01:41:09,030
Yeah. Good.
That's fine.

1710
01:41:09,664 --> 01:41:10,965
Harry...

1711
01:41:11,032 --> 01:41:13,835
So I'm gonna be the
laughing stock of Broadway?

1712
01:41:13,901 --> 01:41:16,504
Harry, he's not you.

1713
01:41:16,571 --> 01:41:19,674
He's a version of the truth of you,
so to speak.

1714
01:41:19,741 --> 01:41:21,109
I'm sorry
to interrupt again

1715
01:41:21,176 --> 01:41:23,378
but Dave wants to know when Henry says,
"I love ya",

1716
01:41:23,445 --> 01:41:25,747
you want that to be "ya,"
not "you," right?

1717
01:41:25,813 --> 01:41:27,048
Right.
Yeah.

1718
01:41:28,183 --> 01:41:29,684
Har...

1719
01:41:52,707 --> 01:41:54,709
Well, you look
really nice.

1720
01:41:55,410 --> 01:41:56,811
Thank you.

1721
01:41:56,878 --> 01:41:58,546
Are you feeling
all right?

1722
01:41:58,613 --> 01:42:03,050
You know,
it isn't like I wanted to stop seeing you.

1723
01:42:03,117 --> 01:42:06,154
We could've carried on
a fun thing for a while.

1724
01:42:06,221 --> 01:42:09,257
Why is it that you broads
want all or nothing?

1725
01:42:09,324 --> 01:42:10,725
I don't know.

1726
01:42:10,792 --> 01:42:12,760
We're just goofy
when it comes to love.

1727
01:42:13,995 --> 01:42:16,063
Harry, if it's all
right with you

1728
01:42:17,232 --> 01:42:19,066
I'd like to be friends.

1729
01:42:19,133 --> 01:42:22,837
I'm not ready to be
your friend. How's that?

1730
01:42:22,904 --> 01:42:24,806
Fine. I understand.

1731
01:42:24,872 --> 01:42:28,976
Anyway, do you actually
buy that horseshit?

1732
01:42:29,043 --> 01:42:32,013
That men and women can be
friends once they've had sex?

1733
01:42:32,079 --> 01:42:33,215
Well, I'm friends
with my ex-husband,

1734
01:42:33,281 --> 01:42:36,318
but then again we didn't
just have sex.

1735
01:42:36,384 --> 01:42:38,853
We didn't
just have sex either.

1736
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:41,856
Then what was it?
I'd love to know.

1737
01:42:41,923 --> 01:42:44,626
Can I e-mail it to you
when I figure it out?

1738
01:42:44,692 --> 01:42:47,729
Okay. Okay.

1739
01:42:47,795 --> 01:42:51,566
Just moving into another phase
with this thing. I'm mad at you.

1740
01:42:51,633 --> 01:42:54,302
I think I'm mad at you too.
Excellent!

1741
01:42:54,369 --> 01:42:58,773
Because I don't like
thinking about you so much

1742
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:03,211
and worrying about how you are
and if I ruined your life.

1743
01:43:03,278 --> 01:43:05,813
You've worried about me?
Yes, honey.

1744
01:43:06,548 --> 01:43:08,149
The schmuck...

1745
01:43:08,216 --> 01:43:10,385
who deserves to die...

1746
01:43:11,286 --> 01:43:13,288
worries about you.

1747
01:43:13,355 --> 01:43:18,092
Sometimes worrying about you
feels like a full-time job.

1748
01:43:18,159 --> 01:43:20,528
Well, doll,
I'm doing great.

1749
01:43:20,595 --> 01:43:23,498
So you don't have
to work that shift anymore.

1750
01:43:23,565 --> 01:43:25,333
Erica?
Huh?

1751
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:28,135
They want you to look at the
costumes for the dancing Henrys.

1752
01:43:28,202 --> 01:43:29,471
Are these
gonna work for you?

1753
01:43:43,518 --> 01:43:46,788
Mr. Sanborn, back so soon?
This is it, I'm dying.

1754
01:43:46,854 --> 01:43:49,557
I've had 20 minutes
of severe chest pains,

1755
01:43:49,624 --> 01:43:51,125
nausea,
shortness of breath

1756
01:43:51,192 --> 01:43:53,728
my blood pressure's
gotta be 170 over 100.

1757
01:43:53,795 --> 01:43:56,431
Give me the nitro,
I didn't take Viagra.

1758
01:43:56,498 --> 01:43:59,334
Plug me into an EKG.
I'm taking two beta-blockers

1759
01:43:59,401 --> 01:44:01,102
blood thinners,
Lipitor, Procardia.

1760
01:44:01,168 --> 01:44:03,271
If I were you,
I'd pound on my chest.

1761
01:44:03,338 --> 01:44:06,408
Mr. Sanborn.
Your diagnosis, although fascinating,

1762
01:44:06,474 --> 01:44:09,043
was entirely incorrect.

1763
01:44:09,110 --> 01:44:10,878
Impossible!
Do you realize

1764
01:44:10,945 --> 01:44:13,114
that a severe anxiety attack can
masquerade as a heart attack?

1765
01:44:15,317 --> 01:44:17,652
So I'm nuts.

1766
01:44:17,719 --> 01:44:20,888
Perfect. The one thing
I'm not taking pills for.

1767
01:44:22,056 --> 01:44:23,891
If you don't wanna
end up here every week

1768
01:44:23,958 --> 01:44:26,794
I suggest you do whatever
it takes to decompress.

1769
01:44:26,861 --> 01:44:28,763
Now lie down.

1770
01:44:28,830 --> 01:44:31,366
Just try something
with me. Come on.

1771
01:44:32,867 --> 01:44:35,069
Give me your hand.

1772
01:44:35,136 --> 01:44:37,004
Relax, relax.

1773
01:44:37,071 --> 01:44:38,940
All right,
close your eyes.

1774
01:44:39,006 --> 01:44:41,776
Okay, good. I want you
to give yourself a visual...

1775
01:44:41,843 --> 01:44:43,811
Both eyes.

1776
01:44:43,878 --> 01:44:46,414
I want you to give
yourself a visual image

1777
01:44:46,481 --> 01:44:49,917
of something that gives you a
feeling of peace and serenity.

1778
01:44:51,686 --> 01:44:53,421
I don't know. What?

1779
01:44:54,622 --> 01:44:56,591
A hammock.
Good.

1780
01:44:57,825 --> 01:45:00,595
What else?
Palm trees.

1781
01:45:02,630 --> 01:45:05,166
Clear, blue water.

1782
01:45:05,232 --> 01:45:07,034
What else do you see?
Feel?

1783
01:45:07,635 --> 01:45:08,803
Taste?

1784
01:45:09,504 --> 01:45:11,639
A peach margarita.

1785
01:45:13,875 --> 01:45:16,110
A Cuban cigar.

1786
01:45:19,213 --> 01:45:20,848
Miles...

1787
01:45:22,850 --> 01:45:24,819
of soft beach.

1788
01:46:47,268 --> 01:46:49,036
I couldn't believe you were
calling from downstairs.

1789
01:46:49,103 --> 01:46:50,972
Wow, you have a beard!

1790
01:46:51,038 --> 01:46:53,107
It's great to see you.

1791
01:46:53,174 --> 01:46:55,009
You couldn't look better.

1792
01:46:55,076 --> 01:46:56,944
Thank you.
Well, come on in.

1793
01:46:57,011 --> 01:47:01,883
No, no.
I just wanted to stop by and say hi and, uh,

1794
01:47:01,949 --> 01:47:04,418
and tell you that I'm sorry
if I ever did anything to you

1795
01:47:04,486 --> 01:47:06,387
that wasn't
on the up and up.

1796
01:47:07,922 --> 01:47:09,557
What do you mean?
You were great to me.

1797
01:47:10,658 --> 01:47:12,960
I was?
Always.

1798
01:47:13,027 --> 01:47:16,097
That's refreshing. Good.

1799
01:47:16,163 --> 01:47:18,232
Well, I don't know what
you've done to yourself

1800
01:47:18,299 --> 01:47:20,902
but you look
absolutely radiant.

1801
01:47:22,169 --> 01:47:23,538
I'm three months pregnant.

1802
01:47:23,605 --> 01:47:25,573
So that might have
something to do with it.

1803
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:27,809
Really?
Yeah.

1804
01:47:27,875 --> 01:47:30,411
Who's the lucky guy?
My husband.

1805
01:47:30,478 --> 01:47:33,314
Hold on because he really
wants to meet you. Danny.

1806
01:47:35,650 --> 01:47:38,219
Harry Sanborn, this is my husband,
Danny Benjamin.

1807
01:47:38,285 --> 01:47:40,555
Heard so much about you.
I bet.

1808
01:47:40,622 --> 01:47:43,257
Well, you know,
with the play and all.

1809
01:47:43,324 --> 01:47:46,127
I'm famous, huh?
Hey, just to us.

1810
01:47:46,193 --> 01:47:47,461
In every interview
my mom does,

1811
01:47:47,529 --> 01:47:50,097
she always says
she made you up.

1812
01:47:50,164 --> 01:47:54,168
So the guy in the play
doesn't make it, does he?

1813
01:47:57,338 --> 01:48:01,475
He basically dies at the
end of the second act.

1814
01:48:01,543 --> 01:48:02,844
But it gets a huge laugh.

1815
01:48:04,245 --> 01:48:06,748
I was hoping
she'd give me a reprieve.

1816
01:48:06,814 --> 01:48:08,282
Yeah, well...

1817
01:48:11,819 --> 01:48:12,920
Okay.

1818
01:48:16,791 --> 01:48:18,325
Good seeing you.
Congratulations.

1819
01:48:18,392 --> 01:48:19,594
Thanks.

1820
01:48:25,466 --> 01:48:28,169
How is she?
She's really good.

1821
01:48:28,235 --> 01:48:29,571
Up to her old tricks.

1822
01:48:29,637 --> 01:48:32,874
Learning Italian, remodeling
her apartment in the city...

1823
01:48:32,940 --> 01:48:37,311
Now, if I wanted to see her,
how would that go over?

1824
01:48:38,212 --> 01:48:40,181
Only one way to find out.

1825
01:48:40,247 --> 01:48:42,083
Except she's out of town
right now.

1826
01:48:42,149 --> 01:48:45,086
Oh, yeah? Where is she?

1827
01:48:45,152 --> 01:48:49,156
Paris. She left two days
ago for her birthday.

1828
01:48:49,223 --> 01:48:51,425
But she'll be back
next week.

1829
01:48:58,365 --> 01:48:59,533
Paris.

1830
01:49:40,207 --> 01:49:41,876
Showtime.

1831
01:50:21,615 --> 01:50:23,050
I knew you'd be here.

1832
01:50:23,117 --> 01:50:24,585
You did?

1833
01:50:24,652 --> 01:50:26,854
At first I thought
I had the wrong restaurant,

1834
01:50:26,921 --> 01:50:29,523
but here you are.

1835
01:50:29,590 --> 01:50:31,492
Just like I imagined.
You mean...

1836
01:50:31,558 --> 01:50:33,027
We're not bumping
into each other?

1837
01:50:33,094 --> 01:50:34,729
You came here to see me?

1838
01:50:36,898 --> 01:50:38,432
I'm aware it was
a bold move, but,

1839
01:50:38,499 --> 01:50:43,270
one of those impulses that grabs you,
but so far we're okay.

1840
01:50:43,337 --> 01:50:44,806
Right?

1841
01:50:44,872 --> 01:50:45,907
Oh.

1842
01:50:46,573 --> 01:50:48,009
I mean... I kind of...

1843
01:50:48,075 --> 01:50:50,244
It would be great

1844
01:50:50,311 --> 01:50:53,047
if you'd let me
take that as a yes.

1845
01:50:53,114 --> 01:50:54,716
Would you like a glass
of wine or something?

1846
01:50:54,782 --> 01:50:56,550
Yeah. I would.

1847
01:50:56,617 --> 01:50:58,252
I would love one.

1848
01:51:01,588 --> 01:51:03,725
I was just gonna
give you a kiss hello.

1849
01:51:03,791 --> 01:51:04,892
Oh...

1850
01:51:09,931 --> 01:51:11,598
Okay.
Whoa.

1851
01:51:11,665 --> 01:51:12,934
Awkward.

1852
01:51:14,869 --> 01:51:16,037
You, uh...

1853
01:51:16,103 --> 01:51:20,041
You remember how you said
if we still knew each other

1854
01:51:20,107 --> 01:51:23,277
we should go to Paris
for our birthdays?

1855
01:51:23,344 --> 01:51:26,480
Well, we still
know each other.

1856
01:51:26,547 --> 01:51:28,282
That's true.

1857
01:51:28,349 --> 01:51:30,051
But, Harry,

1858
01:51:30,117 --> 01:51:31,853
I haven't heard from you
in six months.

1859
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:34,588
Yeah.

1860
01:51:34,655 --> 01:51:37,124
After I saw you in the
theater that afternoon

1861
01:51:37,191 --> 01:51:39,126
with the dancing Henrys...

1862
01:51:39,193 --> 01:51:40,962
Yes. Sorry...

1863
01:51:41,028 --> 01:51:44,498
No, it's very funny,
by the way.

1864
01:51:44,565 --> 01:51:47,601
I had another episode.
Oh, I'm sorry.

1865
01:51:47,668 --> 01:51:50,337
Well, as it turned out,
I was fine

1866
01:51:50,404 --> 01:51:52,106
but I was sure I was dying,

1867
01:51:52,173 --> 01:51:55,676
and the doctor in the ER
said I needed to, uh,

1868
01:51:56,410 --> 01:51:58,145
to decompress.

1869
01:51:58,212 --> 01:51:59,480
So I did.

1870
01:51:59,546 --> 01:52:02,283
I walked out of there
and changed my life.

1871
01:52:02,349 --> 01:52:06,553
Sold most of my businesses,
packed my bags,

1872
01:52:06,620 --> 01:52:09,023
moved to an island
in the Caribbean.

1873
01:52:09,090 --> 01:52:10,657
And that is where you've
been all this time?

1874
01:52:10,724 --> 01:52:12,326
You've been
in the Caribbean?

1875
01:52:12,393 --> 01:52:14,595
Actually, no.

1876
01:52:14,661 --> 01:52:16,931
I was there about six hours

1877
01:52:16,998 --> 01:52:20,367
when it occurred to me that wasting
away on an island in the Caribbean

1878
01:52:20,434 --> 01:52:23,204
couldn't possibly cure
what was ailing me.

1879
01:52:23,270 --> 01:52:26,473
So I decided to take
another kind of trip,

1880
01:52:26,540 --> 01:52:30,611
into, uh, let's call it,
my past.

1881
01:52:30,677 --> 01:52:31,813
Your past?

1882
01:52:31,879 --> 01:52:34,248
I thought if I visited some
of the women I've known

1883
01:52:34,315 --> 01:52:37,819
that maybe I could figure out
how I arrived at being me.

1884
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:39,987
Wow.

1885
01:52:40,054 --> 01:52:42,589
Wow, yeah,
it was quite a journey.

1886
01:52:44,558 --> 01:52:45,927
Hi, Louise.
Remember me?

1887
01:52:47,694 --> 01:52:49,831
Hi, how are...?

1888
01:52:49,897 --> 01:52:53,267
Some of the ladies, I admit,
weren't too interested

1889
01:52:53,334 --> 01:52:56,137
in seeing me,
or even speaking to me,

1890
01:52:56,203 --> 01:52:59,941
but one day,
my losing streak ended.

1891
01:53:00,007 --> 01:53:02,143
One of them
opened up to me.

1892
01:53:02,209 --> 01:53:04,545
Hearing what she had
to say was no picnic,

1893
01:53:04,611 --> 01:53:06,280
but I stuck it out
and I listened.

1894
01:53:06,347 --> 01:53:07,882
And then I listened harder.

1895
01:53:07,949 --> 01:53:09,951
And one of the things
I realized

1896
01:53:10,017 --> 01:53:12,820
was I was actually
giving closure

1897
01:53:12,887 --> 01:53:15,422
to generations of women.

1898
01:53:15,489 --> 01:53:18,559
When you hear the same
story about yourself

1899
01:53:18,625 --> 01:53:22,196
over and over,
your life begins to add up.

1900
01:53:23,697 --> 01:53:25,900
Took me months
to find them all.

1901
01:53:25,967 --> 01:53:27,734
Visited a dozen
different states.

1902
01:53:27,801 --> 01:53:31,538
But I traveled
the farthest to see you.

1903
01:53:40,614 --> 01:53:42,349
I don't believe it.

1904
01:53:43,717 --> 01:53:44,886
Oh!

1905
01:53:45,619 --> 01:53:46,954
Me either.

1906
01:53:48,222 --> 01:53:51,258
Doc. How are you?
I'm good.

1907
01:53:51,325 --> 01:53:53,527
Nice to see you.
You too.

1908
01:53:53,594 --> 01:53:55,696
I should have told you
he was coming,

1909
01:53:55,762 --> 01:53:58,499
but I was so engrossed
in your story. I just...

1910
01:53:58,565 --> 01:54:00,868
Sorry I'm late.

1911
01:54:00,935 --> 01:54:04,939
What story?
Oh, maybe another time.

1912
01:54:05,006 --> 01:54:08,175
So I guess I should've
seen your play.

1913
01:54:08,242 --> 01:54:09,610
Would've known
how this ended.

1914
01:54:09,676 --> 01:54:11,478
Yeah.
Yeah, big twist, huh?

1915
01:54:11,545 --> 01:54:12,779
Yeah.

1916
01:54:12,846 --> 01:54:15,316
So, what are you doing
over here, man?

1917
01:54:15,382 --> 01:54:20,754
Just a vacation.
I've never been to Paris in January.

1918
01:54:20,821 --> 01:54:23,090
It's amazing to run into you.
You look good, Harry.

1919
01:54:23,157 --> 01:54:24,591
Oh, you do,
you look great.

1920
01:54:24,658 --> 01:54:25,893
I haven't been
on a gurney

1921
01:54:25,960 --> 01:54:28,395
in six months,
so that's something.

1922
01:54:30,064 --> 01:54:32,733
Well, I've just been
to every store in the city.

1923
01:54:32,799 --> 01:54:34,001
What?

1924
01:54:34,068 --> 01:54:35,702
This woman's impossible
to buy for,

1925
01:54:35,769 --> 01:54:39,640
but I think I finally found
the right gift.

1926
01:54:46,047 --> 01:54:47,448
Happy birthday, baby.

1927
01:55:01,428 --> 01:55:04,999
I'll open it in a bit.
No, no, no, no. You know what?

1928
01:55:05,066 --> 01:55:06,467
I'm gonna
let you two celebrate.

1929
01:55:06,533 --> 01:55:07,834
Harry, no, please.

1930
01:55:07,901 --> 01:55:08,936
You're welcome to stay.

1931
01:55:09,003 --> 01:55:10,071
Join us for dinner.
We'd love to...

1932
01:55:10,137 --> 01:55:11,438
I can't.
I can't. Really.

1933
01:55:11,505 --> 01:55:12,974
Why? You have
somewhere to go?

1934
01:55:40,401 --> 01:55:42,169
I've spent a lot
of time in hospitals.

1935
01:55:43,837 --> 01:55:45,839
It doesn't matter, right?

1936
01:55:50,377 --> 01:55:53,547
Went to see a... What was it?
No, it was a wheaten terrier.

1937
01:55:53,614 --> 01:55:55,816
So beautiful.
So beautiful.

1938
01:56:00,621 --> 01:56:07,394
* Happy birthday to you

1939
01:56:07,461 --> 01:56:11,632
* Happy birthday,
dear Erica *

1940
01:56:11,698 --> 01:56:15,369
* Happy birthday to you

1941
01:56:15,436 --> 01:56:16,637
Make a wish.

1942
01:56:21,308 --> 01:56:23,977
To the forces of destiny that
brought us together tonight.

1943
01:56:24,045 --> 01:56:26,513
Forces of destiny.
Beautiful.

1944
01:56:29,416 --> 01:56:31,485
What are you doing?
You don't smoke.

1945
01:56:31,552 --> 01:56:32,853
I'm in Paris.

1946
01:56:32,919 --> 01:56:34,721
Secondhand smoke
will kill you anyway.

1947
01:56:34,788 --> 01:56:37,924
She's very brilliant,
but the woman cannot hold her liquor.

1948
01:56:37,991 --> 01:56:39,860
I like that about me.
Me too.

1949
01:56:45,132 --> 01:56:47,834
Now if I were writing this,
this is where I would write:

1950
01:56:47,901 --> 01:56:49,670
"An awkward moment."

1951
01:56:49,736 --> 01:56:52,173
Honey, if you were writing this,
I'd be dead.

1952
01:56:54,475 --> 01:56:56,343
Never fails to amuse her.

1953
01:56:58,779 --> 01:56:59,880
No. Harry,
please, let us.

1954
01:56:59,946 --> 01:57:01,082
Oh, no.
Please, let us.

1955
01:57:01,148 --> 01:57:03,884
Doc, I insist.
I crashed your party.

1956
01:57:03,950 --> 01:57:05,519
No. At least let
me buy you dinner

1957
01:57:05,586 --> 01:57:07,221
on your birthday.

1958
01:57:07,754 --> 01:57:08,955
Thank you.

1959
01:57:11,125 --> 01:57:13,427
What time does that say?

1960
01:57:13,494 --> 01:57:16,463
Oh, God, I have no idea.
Oh, wait a minute, I...

1961
01:57:16,530 --> 01:57:18,065
Me too. Me too.

1962
01:57:29,876 --> 01:57:32,012
You think you look
so handsome in mine?

1963
01:57:32,079 --> 01:57:34,215
You know how long I have
been looking for those?

1964
01:57:35,382 --> 01:57:36,717
Yes, I do.

1965
01:57:40,187 --> 01:57:41,955
Thank you very much.

1966
01:57:46,860 --> 01:57:50,531
Excuse me. Thank you.

1967
01:57:52,599 --> 01:57:56,303
Once again, closure.

1968
01:58:05,279 --> 01:58:07,181
Well, here we are.

1969
01:58:07,248 --> 01:58:08,449
Harry,
why don't you take it.

1970
01:58:08,515 --> 01:58:11,017
No, no. I think I'm gonna walk.
You two take it.

1971
01:58:12,052 --> 01:58:13,587
Well.

1972
01:58:13,654 --> 01:58:16,022
Harry. Doc.
Thanks for everything.

1973
01:58:17,758 --> 01:58:20,294
Stay well.
Well, this was fun.

1974
01:58:20,361 --> 01:58:24,431
And it was so great
to see you. Honest. So...

1975
01:58:28,802 --> 01:58:31,071
It was great
to see you.

1976
01:58:31,138 --> 01:58:33,039
Look...

1977
01:58:33,106 --> 01:58:35,709
Erica, if you ever...

1978
01:58:35,776 --> 01:58:36,877
No.

1979
01:58:44,451 --> 01:58:46,820
Take care
of yourself, Harry.

1980
01:58:46,887 --> 01:58:48,622
Yeah, I will. You too.

1981
01:58:49,390 --> 01:58:50,924
It's cold, huh?

1982
01:59:52,118 --> 01:59:54,255
Look who gets
to be the girl.

1983
01:59:59,159 --> 02:00:00,661
Anything else?

1984
02:00:18,879 --> 02:00:20,881
Where's Julian?

1985
02:00:20,947 --> 02:00:22,649
He's back at the hotel.

1986
02:00:23,917 --> 02:00:26,587
He said when
he saw me with you

1987
02:00:26,653 --> 02:00:28,822
he knew that I was still
in love with you.

1988
02:00:31,258 --> 02:00:33,694
What do you have
to say about that?

1989
02:00:36,730 --> 02:00:39,600
If it's true,
my life just got made.

1990
02:00:41,968 --> 02:00:44,037
Why'd you come here,
Harry?

1991
02:00:47,608 --> 02:00:50,711
Turns out the heart attack
was easy to get over.

1992
02:00:52,178 --> 02:00:53,246
You,

1993
02:00:54,415 --> 02:00:56,283
were something else.

1994
02:00:56,350 --> 02:00:59,286
I finally get what
it's all about.

1995
02:00:59,353 --> 02:01:02,489
I'm 63 years old

1996
02:01:02,556 --> 02:01:04,958
and I...
I'm in love...

1997
02:01:07,494 --> 02:01:09,496
for the first time
in my life.

1998
02:01:12,366 --> 02:01:14,601
That's what
I came here to say.

1999
02:01:18,439 --> 02:01:19,606
Harry.

2000
02:01:33,987 --> 02:01:35,422
Thank you...

2001
02:01:53,273 --> 02:01:54,641
Sanborn.

2002
02:01:54,708 --> 02:01:56,276
Mr. Sanborn.

2003
02:01:56,343 --> 02:01:59,045
Four and a half.

2004
02:01:59,112 --> 02:02:00,581
Got your
table waiting.

2005
02:02:15,095 --> 02:02:19,666
* You got to learn
How to fall *

2006
02:02:21,034 --> 02:02:23,269
* Before you learn
To fly *

2007
02:02:25,439 --> 02:02:29,843

* Before you learn to fly
Learn how to fall *

2009
02:02:43,457 --> 02:02:47,160
* You got to drift
In the breeze *

2010
02:02:49,362 --> 02:02:53,199
* Before you set your sails

2011
02:02:53,266 --> 02:02:58,338
* Oh it's an occupation
Where the wind prevails *

2012
02:02:58,405 --> 02:03:01,041
* Before you set your sails

2013
02:03:01,107 --> 02:03:03,544
* Drift in the breeze

2014
02:03:11,752 --> 02:03:15,989

* Learn how to fall *

* Hold me close
And hold me fast *

2020

* When you kiss me

2023
02:05:54,981 --> 02:05:56,650
* Heaven sighs

2024
02:05:57,651 --> 02:06:01,187
* And though I close my eyes

2025
02:06:01,254 --> 02:06:05,558
