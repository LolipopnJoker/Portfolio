<i>Once upon a time
in a faraway land

00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:54,263
<i>a young prince lived
in a shining castle.

4
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:57,891
<i>Although he had
everything his heart desired

5
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:02,980
<i>the prince was spoiled,
selfish and unkind.

6
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,440
<i>But then, one winter's night

7
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,777
<i>an old beggar woman
came to the castle

8
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,405
<i>and offered him a single rose

9
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:15,242
<i>in return for shelter
from the bitter cold.

10
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,828
<i>Repulsed by
her haggard appearance

11
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:22,749
<i>the prince sneered at the gift
and turned the old woman away

12
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:26,920
<i>but she warned him not to be
deceived by appearances

13
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,047
<i>for beauty is found within

14
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,675
<i>and when he dismissed her again

15
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:34,678
<i>the old woman's ugliness
melted away

16
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:37,431
<i>to reveal
a beautiful enchantress.

17
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:41,018
<i>The prince tried to apologize,
but it was too late

18
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:44,688
<i>for she had seen that there was
no love in his heart

19
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:47,441
<i>and as punishment,
she transformed him

20
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,067
<i>into a hideous beast

21
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:52,362
<i>and placed a powerful spell
on the castle

22
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,364
<i>and all who lived there.

23
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,783

inside his castle

<i>with a magic mirror
as his only window

26
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,209
<i>to the outside world.

27
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:10,339
<i>The rose she had offered
was truly an enchanted rose

28
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:14,092
<i>which would bloom
until his 21st year.

29
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,970
<i>lf he could learn
to love another

30
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:22,226
<i>and earn her love in return
by the time the last petal fell

31
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:25,270
<i>then the spell would be broken.

32
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:30,734
<i>lf not, he would be doomed
to remain a beast for all time.

33
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:36,990
<i>As the years passed,
he fell into despair

34
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,077
<i>and lost all hope

35
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:47,334
<i>for who could ever learn
to love a beast?

Oh, l couldn't put it down.

Not since yesterday.

That's all right.

That one?

83
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,328
But you've read it twice.

84
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,580
Well, it's my favorite--
far-off places

85
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:49,998
daring sword fights

86
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,834
magic spells, a
prince in disguise.

87
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:55,087

# That girl is so peculiar #

93

# l wonder
if she's feeling well #

94
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,809
# With a dreamy, far-off look #

95
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:10,561
# And her nose stuck in a book #

96
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:14,690
# What a puzzle to the rest

97
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:20,612
# Oh, isn't this amazing? #

98
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:30,122

that it's him #

101
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:43,552
# Till Chapter Three #

102
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:45,554
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

103
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:49,141
# Now, it's no wonder
that her name means beauty #

104
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:52,394
# Her looks have got
no parallel #

105
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:54,271
# But behind
that fair facade #

106
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:56,398
# l'm afraid
she's rather odd #

107
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,400
# Very different
from the rest of us #

108
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,235
# She's nothing like
the rest of us #

109

# Yes, different
from the rest of us is Belle #

110
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,913
Wow, you didn't miss
a shot, Gaston.

111
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,039

No beast alive

and no girl,
for that matter.

She's the one-- the lucky girl

120
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,055
But, she...

121
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,389
The most beautiful girl in town.

123
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,351
That makes her the best

124
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,061
and don't l

125
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,187
Well, of course.

Gaston,

159
00:07:58,812 --> 00:07:59,938
How can you read this?

160
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,064
There's no pictures.

161
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,192
Well, some people
use their imagination.

162
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,277
Belle, it's about time
you got your head

163
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,320
out of those books

164
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:09,072
and paid attention
to more important things...

165
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,240
like me.

166
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:14,620
The whole town's
talking about it.

167
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,705
lt's not right
for a woman to read.

168
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:19,499
Soon she starts getting ideas,
and thinking...

169
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,043
Gaston,
you are positively primeval.

170
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,711
Why, thank you, Belle.

171
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:24,004
What do you say you and me

172
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:25,506
take a walk over to the tavern

173
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,090
and take a look
at my trophies?

174
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,884
Maybe some other time.

175
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:30,052
What's wrong with her?

176
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:31,094
She's crazy.

177
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,679
He's gorgeous.

178
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,056
Please, Gaston, l can't.

179
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,308
l have to get home
to help my father.

180
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,309
Good-bye.

181
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:38,852
That crazy old loon--

182
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:40,312
he needs all the
help he can get.

183
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,023
Don't talk about my father

184
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:43,941
that way.

185
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,568
Yeah, don't talk
about her father that way.

186
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,445
My father is not crazy.

187
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:49,530
He's a genius.

188
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,411
Ooh!

189
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,211
Papa?

190
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:06,713
How on earth did that happen?

191
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,215
Doggone it!

192
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:10,092
Are you all right, Papa?

193
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:13,887
l'm about ready to give
up on this hunk of junk.

194
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,722
You always say that.

195
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:16,932
l mean it this time.

196
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:17,891
l'll never get

197
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:20,269
this boneheaded contraption
to work!

198
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,436
Yes, you will

199
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,772
and you'll win first prize
at the fair tomorrow.

200
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:24,773
Humph!

201
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:27,734
And become
a world-famous inventor.

202
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,736
You really believe that?

203
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:31,280
l always have.

204
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,448
Well, what are we waiting for?

205
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,118
l'll have this thing fixed
in no time.

206
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,536
Hand me that, uh...

207
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,288
dog-legged clincher, there.

208
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:42,124
So, did you have a
good time in town today?

209
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,293
l got a new book.

210
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:47,671
Papa, do you think l'm odd?

211
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:48,881
My daughter? Odd?

212
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:52,009
Where would you get
an idea like that?

213
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,135
Oh, l don't know.

214
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:56,013
lt's just that l'm not sure
l fit in here.

215
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:58,515
There's no one
l can really talk to.

216
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,309
What about that Gaston?

217
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:02,060
He's a handsome fellow.

218
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,939
He's handsome, all right,
and rude, and conceited, and...

219
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,691
Oh, Papa, he's not for me.

220
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:09,109
Well, don't you worry

221
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:12,070
'cause this invention's
going to be the start

222
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,530
of a new life for us.

223
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,157
l think that's done it.

224
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:17,034
Now, let's give it a try.

225
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:32,549
lt works!

226
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,885
lt does?

227
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,094
lt does!

228
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,095
You did it!

229
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,388
You really did it!

230
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,182
Hitch up Philippe, girl.

231
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:42,476
l'm off to the fair!

232
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:45,229
Good-bye, Papa.

233
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:46,647
Good luck.

234
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:52,778
Good-bye, Belle,
and take care while l'm gone.

235
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:08,669
We should be there
by now.

236
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:11,922
Maybe we've missed
the turn.

237
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:13,882
l guess l should have taken...

238
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:15,342
Wait a minute.

239
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:21,765
Let's go this way.

240
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,486
Come on, Philippe,
it's a shortcut.

241
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,029
We'll be there in no time.

242
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,383
This can't be right.

243
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:59,094
Where have you taken us,
Philippe?

244
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:01,930
We'd better turn around.

245
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:04,850
Whoa...

246
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:07,311
Whoa, boy, whoa, whoa, Philippe.

247
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,272
Oh...!

248
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,065
Oh, look out!

249
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:17,446
Whoa!

250
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,489
Whoa, boy!

251
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,326
Back up, back up, back up!

252
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,453
Good boy, good boy.

253
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:25,495
That's it.

254
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:26,580
Back up!

255
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:28,332
Steady, steady.

256
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:29,458
Now, steady.

257
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:33,629
Philippe, no!

258
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:40,928
Philippe.

259
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,599
Oh...

260
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,664
Help!

261
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,958
ls someone there?!

262
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,501
Help!

263
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,632
Oh!

264
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:41,029
What...?

265
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:44,074
Oh...

266
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:53,375
Hello?

267
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:56,753
Poor fellow, must have
lost his way in the woods.

268
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:59,089
Keep quiet; maybe
he'll go away.

269
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:01,425
ls someone there?

270
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:05,220
Not a word, Lumiere;
not one word.

271
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:09,141
l don't mean to intrude,
but l've lost my horse

272
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:11,393
and l need a place to stay

273
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:12,519
for the night.

274
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,563
Oh, Cogsworth, have a heart.

275
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:16,231
Shh!

276
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:20,944
Of course, <i>Monsieur,
you are welcome here.

277
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:22,571
Who said that?

278
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:24,573
Over here.

279
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:25,866
Where?

280
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:26,783
<i>Allo.

281
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:31,997
lncredible.

282
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:34,750
Well, now you've done it,
Lumiere.

283
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,835
Splendid, just peachy. Ah!

284
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:38,295
How is this accomplished?

285
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:39,546
Put me down at once!

286
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:40,547
Stop that!

287
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:42,925
Stop that, l say.

288
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:45,886
Ow!

289
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:51,016
Huh... Close that at once.

290
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:52,518
Do you mind?!

291
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,936
l-l beg your pardon.

292
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:56,897
lt's, it's just
that l've never seen a...

293
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:08,116
Oh, you are soaked to the bone,
<i>Monsieur.

294
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,285
Come, warm yourself by the fire.

295
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:11,328
Thank you.

296
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:12,621
No, no, no.

297
00:15:12,663 --> 00:15:15,958
You know what the master will do
if he finds him here.

298
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:19,753
l demand
that you stop right there.

299
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:21,004
Oh, no, no!

300
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:22,923
Not the master's chair.

301
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:25,843
l'm not seeing this!

302
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:27,094
l am not seeing this!

303
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:31,682
Well, hello there, boy.

304
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:37,145
What service.

305
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:39,940
All right,
this has gone far enough.

306
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,525
l'm in charge here.

307
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:43,861
How would you like
a nice spot of tea, sir?

308
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:45,487
lt'll warm you up
in no time.

309
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:47,489
No. No tea.

310
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:50,325
No tea!

311
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:53,078
His mustache tickles, Mama.

312
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:54,079
Oh!

313
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:56,540
Hello.

314
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:03,255
Uh-oh.

315
00:16:03,255 --> 00:16:07,676
Oh...

316
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,055
Ah...

317
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:14,057
There's a stranger here.

318
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:15,601
Master, allow me to explain.

319
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:17,686
The gentleman
was lost in the woods.

320
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:18,937
He was cold and wet...

321
00:16:20,856 --> 00:16:23,358
Master, l'd like
to take this moment to say

322
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:25,319
l was against this
from the start.

323
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:26,570
lt was all his fault.

324
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,740
l tried to stop them,
but would they listen to me? No.

325
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:36,872
Who are you?

326
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:38,123
What are you doing here?

327
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:40,626
l-l-l was lost in the woods,
and, and...

328
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:41,585
You're not welcome here!

329
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:44,755
l-l-l'm sorry.

330
00:16:44,755 --> 00:16:45,923
What are you staring at?!

331
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:46,965
N-Nothing.

332
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:49,259
So, you've come to stare

333
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:50,719
at the Beast, have you?!

334
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,054
Please, l meant no harm!

335
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:53,931
l just needed
a place to stay.

336
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:55,891
l'll give you
a place to stay.

337
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:57,059
Oh, no...!

338
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:58,393
Please! Oh, no!

339
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,902
Oh, boy, Belle's going to get
the surprise of her life

340
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:08,278
huh, Gaston?

341
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,948
Yep. This is her lucky day.

342
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:17,412
l'd like to thank you all
for coming to my wedding.

343
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:20,082
But first l'd better go in there
and propose to the girl.

344
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:24,753
And you, Lefou--
now, when

345
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:26,380
Belle and l come
out that door...

346
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:27,339
Oh, l know, l know!

347
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:28,799
l-l strike up the band.

348
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:33,387
Not yet!

349
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:35,097
Sorry.

350
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,693
Gaston.

351
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,486
What a pleasant surprise.

352
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:50,779
lsn't it, though?

353
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:52,948
l'm just full of surprises.

354
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,117
You know, Belle, there's
not a girl in town

355
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:57,160
who wouldn't love
to be in your shoes.

356
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,329
This is the day...

357
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:00,873
Hmm.

358
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,124
Yeah.

359
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:04,334
This is the day your
dreams come true.

360
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:07,713
What do you know
about my dreams, Gaston?

361
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:11,258
Plenty. Here, picture this:

362
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:13,343
A rustic hunting lodge

363
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:16,513
my latest kill
roasting on the fire

364
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:19,641
and my little wife,
massaging my feet

365
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:21,018
while the little ones

366
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:22,769
play on the floor
with the dogs.

367
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:23,979
We'll have six or seven.

368
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:24,855
Dogs?

369
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:25,856
No, Belle!

370
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:27,107
Strapping boys,
like me.

371
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:28,108
lmagine that.

372
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:29,109
And do you know

373
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,694
who that little
wife will be?

374
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:31,695
Let me think.

375
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:32,779
You, Belle.

376
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:33,947
Gaston, l'm...

377
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,282
l'm...

378
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:36,617
speechless.

379
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:39,161
l really don't
know what to say.

380
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:40,204
Say you'll marry me.

381
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:43,373
l'm very sorry,
Gaston, but...

382
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:44,374
but...

383
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:45,709
l just don't deserve you.

384
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,544
Whoa!

385
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:02,643
So, how'd it go?

386
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:07,439
l'll have Belle for my wife.

387
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:10,234
Make no mistake about that!

388
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:12,236
Touchy.

389
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:22,079
ls he gone?

390
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:24,623
Can you imagine?

391
00:19:24,623 --> 00:19:26,542
He asked me to marry him.

392
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:30,087
Me, the wife of that boorish,
brainless...

393
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:32,840
# <i>Madame Gaston #

394
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,508
# Can't you just see it? #

395
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:35,968
# <i>Madame Gaston #

396
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:37,344
# His little wife #

397
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:41,223
# No, sir, not me #

398
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:42,558
# l guarantee it #

399
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:49,106
# l want much more
than this provincial life #

400
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:00,284
# l want adventure
in the great, wide somewhere #

401
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:03,996
# l want it more
than l can tell #

402
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:08,834
# And for once
it might be grand #

403
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:12,337
# To have someone understand #

404
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:19,011
# l want so much more
than they've got planned. #

405
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:24,099
Philippe!
What are you doing here?

406
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:25,642
Where's...?

407
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:26,810
Where's Papa?

408
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,228
Where is he, Philippe?

409
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,479
What happened?

410
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:30,898
Oh, we have to find him.

411
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:33,775
You have to take me to him.

412
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:47,664
What is this place?

413
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,084
Philippe, please!

414
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,169
Steady!

415
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:55,130
Steady.

416
00:20:58,175 --> 00:21:00,469
Papa.

417
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:03,388
Couldn't keep quiet, could we?

418
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:05,724
Just had to invite him
to stay, didn't we?

419
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:07,309
Serve him tea.

420
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:08,894
Sit in the master's chair.

421
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:10,312
Pet the pooch.

422
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:12,314
l was trying
to be hospitable.

423
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:14,900
Hello?

424
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,778
ls anyone here?

425
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:21,532
Hello? Papa?

426
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:23,700
Papa?

427
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,869
Are you here?

428
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:28,872
Mama, there's a girl
in the castle.

429
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:32,292
Now, Chip, l'll not have you
making up such wild stories.

430
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:33,836
Really, Mama.
l saw her.

431
00:21:33,836 --> 00:21:34,795
Not another word.

432
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:35,796
But...

433
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:36,797
lnto the tub.

434
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:37,798
Woop...

435
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:39,800
Well! l saw a girl
in the castle!

436
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,386
See? l told you.

437
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:44,388
lrresponsible,
devil-may-care

438
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:46,390
waxy-eared,
slack-jawed...

439
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,309
Papa?

440
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:51,728
Did you see that?

441
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:54,231
lt's a girl!

442
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:55,566
l know it's a girl.

443
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:56,483
Don't you see?

444
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:57,693
She's the one--

445
00:21:57,693 --> 00:21:59,403
the girl we have
been waiting for.

446
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:00,821
She has come
to break the spell!

447
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:05,158
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

448
00:22:05,868 --> 00:22:07,369
Papa?

449
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:11,874
Papa?

450
00:22:11,874 --> 00:22:13,083
Hello?

451
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,085
ls someone here?

452
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:16,378
Wait!

453
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,422
l'm looking for
my father. l...

454
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:22,092
That's funny.

455
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:26,096
l'm sure there was someone.

456
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:27,598
l-ls anyone here?

457
00:22:27,598 --> 00:22:28,932
Belle?

458
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:32,269
Papa!

459
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:33,562
H-How did you find me?

460
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:35,105
Oh, your hands
are like ice.

461
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:37,733
l have to get
you out of there.

462
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:39,401
Belle, l want you
to leave this place.

463
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:40,527
Who's done this to you?

464
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:41,945
No time to explain.

465
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:42,946
You must go! Now!

466
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:44,031
l won't leave you!

467
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:45,574
What are you doing here?

468
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:46,491
Run, Belle!

469
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:48,160
Who's there?
Who are you?

470
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:49,953
The master of this castle.

471
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:52,581
l've come for my father.

472
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:54,041
Please let him out.

473
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:55,292
Can't you see he's sick?

474
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:57,461
Then he shouldn't have
trespassed here!

475
00:22:57,461 --> 00:22:59,046
But he could die.

476
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:00,380
Please, l-l'll do anything.

477
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:03,008
There's nothing you can do.

478
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:04,218
He's my prisoner.

479
00:23:04,218 --> 00:23:06,720
Oh, there must be
some way l can...

480
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,807
Wait!

481
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:15,187
Take me instead.

482
00:23:15,187 --> 00:23:17,981
You?!

483
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:19,983
You would...

484
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:21,485
take his place?

485
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:22,486
Belle, no!

486
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:24,488
You don't know
what you're doing!

487
00:23:24,488 --> 00:23:26,740
lf l did,
would you let him go?

488
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:33,705
Yes. But you must promise
to stay here forever.

489
00:23:33,705 --> 00:23:38,168
Come into the light.

490
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,220
No, Belle!

491
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:52,850
l won't let you do this!

492
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,017
You have my word.

493
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:56,019
Done!

494
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:01,024
No, Belle,
listen to me.

495
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,651
l'm old.
l've lived my life.

496
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:03,694
Wait.

497
00:24:03,694 --> 00:24:04,361
Belle!

498
00:24:04,403 --> 00:24:05,112
Wait!

499
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:07,865
No, please spare my daughter.

500
00:24:07,865 --> 00:24:09,032
Please!

501
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:10,409
She's no longer
your concern.

502
00:24:11,535 --> 00:24:12,995
Take him
to the village.

503
00:24:12,995 --> 00:24:13,996
Let me out!

504
00:24:13,996 --> 00:24:15,289
Please let me out!

505
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:17,082
Let me out!

506
00:24:17,082 --> 00:24:19,877
Please! Oh, please!

507
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:26,049
Master?

508
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:27,092
What?

509
00:24:27,092 --> 00:24:29,553
Since the girl is going
to be with us

510
00:24:29,553 --> 00:24:30,888
for quite some time

511
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:34,016
l was thinking that you
might want to offer her

512
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:35,684
a more comfortable room.

513
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:39,271
Then again, maybe not.

514
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:44,693
You didn't even let me
say good-bye.

515
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:46,737
l'll never see him
again.

516
00:24:46,737 --> 00:24:49,907
l didn't get
to say good-bye.

517
00:24:49,907 --> 00:24:51,742
l'll show you to your room.

518
00:24:51,742 --> 00:24:53,202
My room?

519
00:24:53,202 --> 00:24:54,661
But l thought...

520
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:56,747
You want to stay in the tower?

521
00:24:56,747 --> 00:24:57,497
No.

522
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:58,707
Then follow me.

523
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:21,563
Say something to her.

524
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:23,607
Huh? Oh.

525
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:28,737
l, uh, hope you like it here.

526
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:32,324
The castle is your home now,
so you can go anywhere you like

527
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:33,700
except the west wing.

528
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,576
What's in the west...?

529
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:39,498
lt's forbidden!

530
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:44,753
Now, if you need anything

531
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:46,797
my servants will attend you.

532
00:25:46,797 --> 00:25:48,298
Dinner.
lnvite her to dinner.

533
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:51,051
You will join me
for dinner.

534
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:53,220
That's not a request!

535
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:13,240
<i>Who does she think she is?

536
00:26:13,282 --> 00:26:16,118
<i>That girl has tangled
with the wrong man.

537
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,120
No one says no
to Gaston.

538
00:26:18,161 --> 00:26:19,204
Darn right.

539
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:21,456
Dismissed, rejected...

540
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:23,041
publicly humiliated.

541
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:25,460
Why, it's more
than l can bear.

542
00:26:25,502 --> 00:26:26,503
More beer?

543
00:26:26,545 --> 00:26:27,462
What for?

544
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:28,797
Nothing helps.

545
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:30,132
l'm disgraced.

546
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:31,383
Who, you?

547
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:33,719
Never!

548
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:36,680
Gaston, you've got
to pull yourself together.

549
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,558
# Gosh, it disturbs me
to see you, Gaston #

550
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,518
# Looking so down
in the dumps #

551
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:46,148
# Every guy here'd
love to be you, Gaston #

552
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:49,484
# Even when taking
your lumps #

553
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:52,446
# There's no man in town
as admired as you #

554
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:56,241
# You're everyone's
favorite guy #

555
00:26:56,283 --> 00:26:59,286
# Everyone's awed and
inspired by you #

556
00:26:59,328 --> 00:27:06,084
# And it's not very hard
to see why #

557
00:27:08,212 --> 00:27:11,215
# No... one's... #

558
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:12,591
# Slick as Gaston #

559
00:27:12,591 --> 00:27:14,510
# No one's quick
as Gaston #

560
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:17,846
# No one's neck's as incredibly
thick as Gaston #

561
00:27:17,846 --> 00:27:21,600
# For there's no man in town
half as manly #

562
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,144
# Perfect, a pure paragon #

563
00:27:24,144 --> 00:27:27,606
# You can ask any Tom, Dick
or Stanley #

564
00:27:27,606 --> 00:27:29,233
# And they'll tell you
whose team #

565
00:27:29,233 --> 00:27:31,818
# They prefer to be on #

566
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:32,903
Ooh!

567
00:27:32,903 --> 00:27:37,115
# No... one's...
been like Gaston #

568
00:27:37,115 --> 00:27:38,784
# A kingpin like Gaston #

569
00:27:38,784 --> 00:27:40,786
# No one's got a full cleft #

570
00:27:40,786 --> 00:27:42,371
# ln his chin
like Gaston #

571
00:27:42,371 --> 00:27:46,124
# As a specimen, yes,
l'm intimidating #

572
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:49,294
# My, what a guy, that Gaston #

573
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:50,838
# Give five "hurrahs!" #

574
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:52,714
# Give 12 "hip-hips!" #

575
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:57,511
# Gaston is the best
and the rest is all drips #

576
00:27:57,553 --> 00:28:01,056
# No... one... #

577
00:28:01,098 --> 00:28:02,516
# Fights like Gaston #

578
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:04,268
# Douses lights like Gaston #

579
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:07,563
# ln a wrestling match,
nobody bites like Gaston #

580
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:10,858
# For there's no one
as burly and brawny #

581
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:14,278
# As you see,
l've got biceps to spare #

582
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:16,780
# Not a bit of him
scraggly or scrawny #

583
00:28:16,822 --> 00:28:18,198
# That's right #

584
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,451
# And every last inch of me's
covered with hair #

585
00:28:21,493 --> 00:28:22,828
# No one hits like Gaston #

586
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,288
# Matches wits like Gaston #

587
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:28,458
# ln a spitting match,
nobody spits like Gaston #

588
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,836
# l'm especially good
at expectorating #

589
00:28:30,878 --> 00:28:31,795
# Ptooey! #

590
00:28:31,837 --> 00:28:34,840
# Ten points for Gaston! #

591
00:28:34,882 --> 00:28:36,300
# When l was a lad #

592
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,302
# l ate four dozen eggs #

593
00:28:38,302 --> 00:28:41,430
# Every morning
to help me get large #

594
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:42,806
# And now
that l'm grown #

595
00:28:42,848 --> 00:28:44,600
# l eat
five dozen eggs #

596
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:50,606
# So l'm roughly
the size of a barge #

597
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:53,901
# No... one... #

598
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:55,569
# Shoots like Gaston #

599
00:28:55,611 --> 00:28:57,362
# Makes those beauts
like Gaston #

600
00:28:57,446 --> 00:29:00,324
# Then goes tromping around
wearing boots like Gaston #

601
00:29:00,324 --> 00:29:04,578
# l use antlers
in all of my decorating #

602
00:29:04,578 --> 00:29:06,997
# My, what a guy #

603
00:29:06,997 --> 00:29:11,502
# Gaston! #

604
00:29:17,174 --> 00:29:19,092
Help!
Someone help me!

605
00:29:19,176 --> 00:29:20,093
Maurice?

606
00:29:20,177 --> 00:29:20,636
Please, please!

607
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:21,887
l need your help.

608
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:23,055
He's got her...

609
00:29:23,096 --> 00:29:24,765
He's got her locked
in the dungeon.

610
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:25,766
Who?

611
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:26,767
Belle. We must go.

612
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:28,769
N-Not a minute to lose.

613
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:29,895
Whoa!

614
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:31,188
Slow down, Maurice.

615
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,232
Who's got Belle locked
in a dungeon?

616
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:34,566
A beast!

617
00:29:34,608 --> 00:29:37,277
A horrible, monstrous
beast.

618
00:29:40,864 --> 00:29:43,033
ls it a big beast?

619
00:29:43,075 --> 00:29:44,076
Huge!

620
00:29:44,117 --> 00:29:45,577
With a long ugly snout?

621
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:46,745
Hideously ugly.

622
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:48,413
And sharp,
cruel fangs?

623
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:49,498
Yes, yes.

624
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,041
Will you help me?

625
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:52,125
All right,
old man.

626
00:29:52,209 --> 00:29:53,502
We'll help you out.

627
00:29:53,544 --> 00:29:55,504
You will?
Oh, thank you.

628
00:29:55,546 --> 00:29:57,422
Thank you.
Thank you!

629
00:29:57,464 --> 00:29:59,424
Oh!

630
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:02,511
Crazy old Maurice.

631
00:30:02,553 --> 00:30:04,638
He's always good
for a laugh.

632
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:08,684
Crazy old Maurice, hmm?

633
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:12,688
Crazy old Maurice... hmm.

634
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:16,817
# Lefou, l'm afraid
l've been thinking #

635
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:18,151
# A dangerous pastime... #

636
00:30:18,235 --> 00:30:20,153
# l know #

637
00:30:20,237 --> 00:30:22,823
# But that wacky old coot
is Belle's father #

638
00:30:22,865 --> 00:30:25,617
# And his sanity's
only so-so #

639
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:28,161
# Now the wheels
in my head #

640
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:29,788
# Have been turning #

641
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,583
# Since l looked at
that loony old man #

642
00:30:32,624 --> 00:30:34,543
# See, l promised myself #

643
00:30:34,585 --> 00:30:36,670
# l'd be married to Belle #

644
00:30:36,753 --> 00:30:40,757
# And right now,
l'm evolving a plan #

645
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:41,758
lf l...

646
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:43,802
Yes?

647
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:44,887
Then we...

648
00:30:44,887 --> 00:30:45,929
No! Would she...?

649
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:46,889
Guess!

650
00:30:46,889 --> 00:30:47,973
Now l get it!

651
00:30:47,973 --> 00:30:49,808
Let's go!

652
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:52,853
# No... one... #

653
00:30:52,853 --> 00:30:54,521
# Plots like Gaston #

654
00:30:54,521 --> 00:30:56,440
# Takes cheap shots
like Gaston #

655
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,484
# Plans to persecute
harmless crackpots like Gaston #

656
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:05,032
# So his marriage
we soon will be celebrating #

657
00:31:05,032 --> 00:31:07,618
# My, what a guy! #

658
00:31:07,618 --> 00:31:14,416
# Gaston! #

659
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:18,337
Will no one help me?

660
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:27,721
Who is it?

661
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:30,557
Mrs. Potts, dear.

662
00:31:30,557 --> 00:31:33,185
l thought you might
like a spot of tea.

663
00:31:33,185 --> 00:31:35,229
But you're... you're a...

664
00:31:35,229 --> 00:31:36,522
Ooh!

665
00:31:36,522 --> 00:31:37,523
Careful.

666
00:31:37,523 --> 00:31:38,482
This is impossible.

667
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:40,025
l know it is.

668
00:31:40,025 --> 00:31:41,902
But here we are.

669
00:31:41,902 --> 00:31:44,655
l told you she was pretty, Mama,
didn't l?

670
00:31:44,655 --> 00:31:47,032
All right, Chip,
now, that'll do.

671
00:31:47,032 --> 00:31:48,116
Slowly now.

672
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:49,660
Don't spill.

673
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,328
Thank you.

674
00:31:51,328 --> 00:31:54,039
Want to see me
do a trick?

675
00:31:55,207 --> 00:31:56,458
Chip!

676
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:58,502
Oops. Sorry.

677
00:31:58,502 --> 00:32:01,129
That was a very brave thing
you did, my dear.

678
00:32:01,129 --> 00:32:02,840
We all think so.

679
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,383
But l've lost my father

680
00:32:04,383 --> 00:32:06,385
my dreams... everything.

681
00:32:06,385 --> 00:32:08,011
Cheer up, child.

682
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:09,388
lt'll turn out

683
00:32:09,388 --> 00:32:11,431
all right
in the end.

684
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:12,683
You'll see.

685
00:32:12,683 --> 00:32:13,892
Oh, listen to me.

686
00:32:13,892 --> 00:32:15,352
Jabbering on while
there's a supper

687
00:32:15,352 --> 00:32:16,436
to get on the table.

688
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:18,438
Chip!

689
00:32:18,438 --> 00:32:19,773
Bye.

690
00:32:19,773 --> 00:32:22,442
Well, now, what shall we
dress you in for dinner?

691
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:24,987
Oh, let's see what l got
in my drawers.

692
00:32:24,987 --> 00:32:27,531
Ooh! How embarrassing.

693
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,368
Ah, here we are.

694
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:32,870
You'll look ravishing

695
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,204
in this one.

696
00:32:34,204 --> 00:32:35,831
That's very kind
of you, but...

697
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:37,291
l'm not going
to dinner.

698
00:32:37,374 --> 00:32:40,002
Oh, but you must.

699
00:32:42,421 --> 00:32:45,299
Dinner is served.

700
00:32:47,426 --> 00:32:49,178
What's taking so long?

701
00:32:49,178 --> 00:32:51,054
l told her to come down.

702
00:32:51,054 --> 00:32:52,389
Why isn't she here yet?

703
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:54,183
Oh, try to be
patient, sir.

704
00:32:54,183 --> 00:32:56,059
The girl has
lost her father

705
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:58,228
and her freedom,
all in one day.

706
00:32:58,228 --> 00:32:59,563
Master, have you thought

707
00:32:59,563 --> 00:33:02,608
that perhaps this girl could
be the one to break the spell?

708
00:33:02,608 --> 00:33:04,067
Of course l have.

709
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:05,444
l'm not a fool.

710
00:33:05,444 --> 00:33:06,820
Good!

711
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,615
So, you fall in love with her,
she falls in love with you

712
00:33:09,615 --> 00:33:11,950
and poof!
The spell is broken.

713
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,952
We'll be human again
by midnight.

714
00:33:13,952 --> 00:33:15,787
Ooh, it's not
that easy, Lumiere.

715
00:33:15,787 --> 00:33:17,080
These things take time.

716
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,208
But the rose has already
begun to wilt.

717
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:21,251
Oh, it's no use.

718
00:33:21,251 --> 00:33:24,046
She's so beautiful, and l'm...

719
00:33:24,046 --> 00:33:27,299
Well, look at me!

720
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:30,344
Oh, you must help her
to see past all that.

721
00:33:30,427 --> 00:33:31,762
l don't know how.

722
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:33,138
Well, you can start

723
00:33:33,222 --> 00:33:34,806
by making yourself
more presentable.

724
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:36,058
Straighten up.

725
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:37,768
Try to act like
a gentleman.

726
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:39,269
Ah, yes.
When she comes in

727
00:33:39,311 --> 00:33:41,271
give her a dashing,
debonair smile.

728
00:33:41,313 --> 00:33:43,023
Come, come,
show me the smile.

729
00:33:44,274 --> 00:33:45,984
But don't frighten
the poor girl.

730
00:33:46,026 --> 00:33:47,736
lmpress her
with your rapier wit.

731
00:33:47,778 --> 00:33:49,571
But be gentle.

732
00:33:49,613 --> 00:33:51,114
Shower her
with compliments.

733
00:33:51,156 --> 00:33:52,157
But be sincere.

734
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:53,158
And above all...

735
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,035
You must control your temper!

736
00:33:56,203 --> 00:33:59,248
Here she is!

737
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:00,958
Good evening.

738
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:04,086
Well, where is she?

739
00:34:04,086 --> 00:34:05,045
Who? Oh.

740
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:07,589
The girl, yes.

741
00:34:07,631 --> 00:34:08,882
The... girl.

742
00:34:08,924 --> 00:34:12,094
Well, actually,
she's in the process of...

743
00:34:12,177 --> 00:34:15,764
Circumstances being
what they are...

744
00:34:15,806 --> 00:34:17,349
She's not coming.

745
00:34:17,391 --> 00:34:19,560
What?!

746
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:20,936
But, your grace...!

747
00:34:20,978 --> 00:34:23,105
Your eminence!

748
00:34:27,776 --> 00:34:29,695
l thought l told you
to come down to dinner!

749
00:34:29,736 --> 00:34:31,071
l'm not hungry.

750
00:34:31,113 --> 00:34:33,073
You come out, or l'll...

751
00:34:33,115 --> 00:34:34,908
l'll... l'll break down
the door!

752
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:36,118
Master...

753
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,662
l could be wrong,
but that may not be

754
00:34:38,704 --> 00:34:41,623
the best way
to win the girl's affections.

755
00:34:41,665 --> 00:34:45,127
Please attempt
to be a gentleman.

756
00:34:45,252 --> 00:34:48,088
But she is being so difficult.

757
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:49,715
Gently, gently.

758
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:53,468
Will you come down to dinner?

759
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,678
No.

760
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,971
Hmm?

761
00:34:56,013 --> 00:34:57,139
Ah, ah, ah!

762
00:34:57,181 --> 00:34:58,432
Suave, genteel.

763
00:34:58,473 --> 00:35:01,393
lt would give me
great pleasure

764
00:35:01,435 --> 00:35:03,478
if you would join
me for dinner.

765
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:05,814
We say please.

766
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,441
Please.

767
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:08,275
No, thank you!

768
00:35:08,317 --> 00:35:09,818
You can't stay in there forever!

769
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,195
Yes, l can.

770
00:35:11,236 --> 00:35:14,948
Fine. Then go ahead
and starve!

771
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:17,242
lf she doesn't eat with me

772
00:35:17,284 --> 00:35:19,786
then she doesn't eat at all.

773
00:35:22,831 --> 00:35:24,291
Oh, dear.

774
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:26,001
That didn't go very well
at all, did it?

775
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:28,879
Lumiere, stand watch
at the door

776
00:35:28,921 --> 00:35:30,797
and inform me at once

777
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:32,549
if there is
the slightest change.

778
00:35:32,549 --> 00:35:34,510
You can count on me,
<i>mon capitan.

779
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,970
Well, we might as well
go downstairs

780
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:40,015
and start cleaning up.

781
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:43,685
l ask nicely,
but she refuses.

782
00:35:43,685 --> 00:35:47,314
Well, what does
she want me to do... beg?

783
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:51,401
Show me the girl.

784
00:35:51,401 --> 00:35:53,320
Well, the master's
really not so bad

785
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,613
once you get
to know him.

786
00:35:54,613 --> 00:35:56,323
Why don't you
give him a chance?

787
00:35:56,323 --> 00:35:58,033
l don't want to
get to know him.

788
00:35:58,033 --> 00:35:59,451
l don't want to
have anything

789
00:35:59,535 --> 00:36:01,245
to do with him!

790
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:05,207
l'm just fooling myself.

791
00:36:05,249 --> 00:36:08,293
She'll never see me
as anything...

792
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:11,046
but a monster.

793
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:17,511
lt's hopeless.

794
00:36:34,736 --> 00:36:35,821
Oh, no!

795
00:36:35,863 --> 00:36:36,989
Oh, yes!

796
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,073
Oh, no!

797
00:36:38,115 --> 00:36:39,283
Oh, yes, yes, yes!

798
00:36:39,324 --> 00:36:41,618
l've been burned
by you before.

799
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:47,291
<i>Zut, alors!
She has emerged!

800
00:36:51,837 --> 00:36:53,547
Come on, Chip,
into the cupboard

801
00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:55,132
with your brothers
and sisters.

802
00:36:56,842 --> 00:36:58,719
But l'm not sleepy.

803
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:00,387
Yes, you are.

804
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:03,056
No, l'm not.

805
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:05,225
l work and l slave all
day long and for what?

806
00:37:05,225 --> 00:37:08,353
A culinary masterpiece
gone to waste.

807
00:37:08,353 --> 00:37:09,646
Oh, stop your grousing.

808
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:11,648
lt's been a long night
for all of us.

809
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:14,610
Well, if you ask me,
she was just being stubborn.

810
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,403
After all,
he did say please.

811
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:18,405
But if the master doesn't learn
to control that temper

812
00:37:18,405 --> 00:37:19,990
he'll never break...

813
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,825
Splendid to see you
out and about, <i>Mademoiselle.

814
00:37:21,825 --> 00:37:26,788
l am Cogsworth,
head of the household.

815
00:37:26,788 --> 00:37:29,166
This is Lumiere.

816
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:31,418
<i>Enchante, cherie.

817
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:32,878

Stop that!

818
00:37:32,878 --> 00:37:34,379
...anything we...
Please!

819
00:37:34,379 --> 00:37:36,882

stay more comfortable.

820
00:37:36,882 --> 00:37:37,966
Ow!

821
00:37:37,966 --> 00:37:39,343
l am a little hungry.

822
00:37:39,343 --> 00:37:40,344
You are?

823
00:37:40,344 --> 00:37:42,012
Hear that?
She's hungry.

824
00:37:42,012 --> 00:37:43,013
Stoke the fire.

825
00:37:43,013 --> 00:37:43,805
Break out
the silver.

826
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:45,307
Wake the china.

827
00:37:45,307 --> 00:37:47,851
Remember what the master said.

828
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:48,977
Oh, pishposh.

829
00:37:48,977 --> 00:37:51,188
l'm not about to let
the poor child go hungry.

830
00:37:51,188 --> 00:37:52,356
All right, fine.

831
00:37:52,356 --> 00:37:54,233
Glass of water, crust
of bread, and then...

832
00:37:54,233 --> 00:37:56,652
Cogsworth, l am
surprised at you.

833
00:37:56,652 --> 00:37:59,363
She is not a prisoner.
She's our guest.

834
00:37:59,363 --> 00:38:01,532
We must make her
feel welcome here.

835
00:38:01,532 --> 00:38:03,283
Right this way,
<i>Mademoiselle.

836
00:38:03,283 --> 00:38:04,409
Well, keep it down.

837
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:06,453
lf the master finds out
about this

838
00:38:06,453 --> 00:38:07,663
it will be
our necks.

839
00:38:07,704 --> 00:38:10,040
Of course, of course.

840
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,876
But what is dinner
without a little music?

841
00:38:12,876 --> 00:38:14,795
Music?

842
00:38:14,795 --> 00:38:17,631
<i>Ma chere

00:40:48,866 --> 00:40:50,951
# Heaven's sake,
is that a spot? #

911
00:40:50,993 --> 00:40:53,704
# Clean it up, we want
the company impressed #

912
00:40:53,745 --> 00:40:55,914
# We've got a lot to do #

913
00:40:55,956 --> 00:40:57,791
# ls it one lump or two? #

914
00:40:57,833 --> 00:40:58,542
# For you, our guest #

915
00:40:58,584 --> 00:40:59,710
# She's our guest #

916
00:40:59,751 --> 00:41:01,003
# She's our guest #

917
00:41:01,044 --> 00:41:02,546
# She's our guest #

918
00:41:02,588 --> 00:41:05,257
People, fun's over,
over here, line up...

919
00:41:06,717 --> 00:41:08,594
# lt's ten years since
we've had anybody here #

920
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:09,636
# And we're obsessed #

921
00:41:09,678 --> 00:41:11,889
# With your meal,
with your ease #

922
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,765
# Yes, indeed,
we aim to please #

923
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:16,143
# While the candlelight's
still glowing #

924
00:41:16,226 --> 00:41:20,564
# Let us help you,
we'll keep going #

925
00:41:20,606 --> 00:41:24,818
# Course... by... course #

926
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,904
# One by one #

927
00:41:26,945 --> 00:41:29,615
# Till you shout,
"Enough, l'm done!" #

928
00:41:29,656 --> 00:41:33,994
# Then we'll sing you
off to sleep as you digest #

929
00:41:34,036 --> 00:41:36,121
# Tonight you'll prop
your feet up #

930
00:41:36,163 --> 00:41:37,706
# But for now, let's eat up #

931
00:41:37,748 --> 00:41:41,877
# Be our guest,
be our guest #

932
00:41:41,919 --> 00:41:43,754
# Be our guest #

933
00:41:43,795 --> 00:41:52,262
# Please be our guest! #

934
00:41:54,556 --> 00:41:55,682
Bravo!

935
00:41:55,724 --> 00:41:57,059
That was wonderful.

936
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,185
Thank you.

937
00:41:58,227 --> 00:42:00,395
Thank you, <i>Mademoiselle.

938
00:42:00,437 --> 00:42:02,314
Good show, wasn't it?

939
00:42:02,356 --> 00:42:03,774
Yes, everyone.

940
00:42:03,815 --> 00:42:07,110
My goodness, look at the time.

941
00:42:07,194 --> 00:42:09,071
Now it's off to bed,
off to bed.

942
00:42:09,112 --> 00:42:11,615
Oh, l couldn't possibly
go to bed now.

943
00:42:11,657 --> 00:42:13,700
lt's my first time
in an enchanted castle.

944
00:42:13,742 --> 00:42:14,785
Enchanted!

945
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:16,912
Who said anything

946
00:42:16,954 --> 00:42:18,830
about the castle
being enchanted?

947
00:42:18,872 --> 00:42:20,874
lt was you, wasn't it?

948
00:42:20,958 --> 00:42:22,668
l figured it out for myself.

949
00:42:25,587 --> 00:42:27,840
l'd like to look around,
if that's all right.

950
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,466
Oh, would you
like a tour?

951
00:42:29,466 --> 00:42:31,134
Wait a second,
wait a second.

952
00:42:31,134 --> 00:42:32,970
l'm not sure that's
such a good idea.

953
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:35,347
We can't let her
go poking around

954
00:42:35,347 --> 00:42:38,433
in certain places, if
you know what l mean.

955
00:42:38,433 --> 00:42:39,935
Perhaps you'd like
to take me.

956
00:42:39,935 --> 00:42:41,353
l'm sure you know
everything

957
00:42:41,353 --> 00:42:43,146
there is to know
about the castle.

958
00:42:43,146 --> 00:42:46,149
Oh, well, actually, l, uh...

959
00:42:46,149 --> 00:42:48,443
Yes, l do.

960
00:42:48,443 --> 00:42:49,653
As you can see

961
00:42:49,653 --> 00:42:52,531
the pseudo-facade
was stripped away

962
00:42:52,531 --> 00:42:54,867
to reveal a minimalist
rococo design.

963
00:42:54,867 --> 00:42:58,078
Note the unusual
inverted vaulted ceilings.

964
00:42:58,078 --> 00:42:59,496
This is yet another example

965
00:42:59,496 --> 00:43:01,540
of the late neoclassic
baroque period.

966
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:02,958
and, as l always say

967
00:43:02,958 --> 00:43:05,169
if it's not baroque,
don't fix it.

968
00:43:07,087 --> 00:43:10,090
Uh, where was l?

969
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:12,217
As you were.

970
00:43:12,217 --> 00:43:14,678
Now, then, if l may
draw your attention

971
00:43:14,678 --> 00:43:17,014
to the flying buttresses
above the...

972
00:43:17,014 --> 00:43:20,058
Uh, <i>Mademoiselle?

973
00:43:24,229 --> 00:43:25,856
What's up there?

974
00:43:25,856 --> 00:43:26,857
Where? There?
Oh, nothing.

975
00:43:26,857 --> 00:43:28,233
Absolutely nothing
of interest at all

976
00:43:28,233 --> 00:43:29,568
in the west wing.

977
00:43:29,568 --> 00:43:31,612
Dusty, dull, very boring.

978
00:43:31,612 --> 00:43:34,198
Ah, so <i>that's the west wing.

979
00:43:34,198 --> 00:43:35,991
Nice going.

980
00:43:35,991 --> 00:43:38,994
l wonder what
he's hiding up there?

981
00:43:38,994 --> 00:43:39,995
Hiding?

982
00:43:39,995 --> 00:43:41,496
The master is
hiding nothing.

983
00:43:41,496 --> 00:43:43,332
Then it wouldn't
be forbidden.

984
00:43:43,332 --> 00:43:45,792
Perhaps, uh,
<i>Mademoiselle would like to

985
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:47,544
uh-uh, uh...
see something else.

986
00:43:47,544 --> 00:43:50,297
We have exquisite tapestries
dating all the way back to...

987
00:43:50,297 --> 00:43:51,340
maybe later.

988
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,758
Th-The gardens or-or

989
00:43:52,758 --> 00:43:54,718
the-the-the-the
library, perhaps.

990
00:43:54,718 --> 00:43:56,011
You have a library?

991
00:43:56,011 --> 00:43:57,638
Yes, oh, indeed.

992
00:43:57,638 --> 00:43:58,764
With books.

993
00:43:58,764 --> 00:44:00,015
Scads of books!

994
00:44:00,015 --> 00:44:01,058
Mountains of books!

995
00:44:01,058 --> 00:44:02,100
Forests of books!

996
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,185
-Cascades!
-Longboats!

997
00:44:03,185 --> 00:44:04,228
Swamps of books!

998
00:44:04,228 --> 00:44:06,188
More books than you'll

999
00:44:06,188 --> 00:44:08,273
ever be able
to read in a lifetime.

1000
00:44:08,273 --> 00:44:10,776
Books on every subject ever
studied, by every author

1001
00:44:10,817 --> 00:44:12,819
who ever set pen
to paper.

1002
00:45:04,746 --> 00:45:06,123
Oh!

1003
00:45:51,835 --> 00:45:53,879
Why did you come here?

1004
00:45:53,879 --> 00:45:55,839
l'm... l'm sorry.

1005
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,509
l warned you never
to come here.

1006
00:45:58,509 --> 00:45:59,760
l didn't mean any harm.

1007
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,013
Do you realize
what you could have done?!

1008
00:46:03,013 --> 00:46:04,681
Please, stop.

1009
00:46:04,681 --> 00:46:06,517
Get out!

1010
00:46:06,517 --> 00:46:08,268
No!

1011
00:46:08,268 --> 00:46:15,192
Get... out!

1012
00:46:23,742 --> 00:46:24,910
Where are you going?

1013
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:26,245
Promise or no promise

1014
00:46:26,245 --> 00:46:28,038
l can't stay here
another minute.

1015
00:46:28,038 --> 00:46:30,415
Oh, no, wait,
please.

1016
00:46:30,415 --> 00:46:31,542
Please wait.

1017
00:47:10,914 --> 00:47:14,501
Oh!

1018
00:47:43,071 --> 00:47:46,658
Oh!

1019
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,897
Here now.

1020
00:48:58,939 --> 00:49:00,399
Oh, don't do that.

1021
00:49:03,652 --> 00:49:06,488
Just hold still.

1022
00:49:07,865 --> 00:49:08,949
That hurts!

1023
00:49:09,032 --> 00:49:10,951
lf you'd hold still,
it wouldn't hurt as much!

1024
00:49:11,034 --> 00:49:12,452
Well, if you hadn't
have run away

1025
00:49:12,494 --> 00:49:13,620
this wouldn't
have happened!

1026
00:49:13,662 --> 00:49:16,707
lf you hadn't frightened me,
l wouldn't have run away!

1027
00:49:16,748 --> 00:49:19,668
Well, you shouldn't have
been in the west wing!

1028
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:21,962
Well, you should learn
to control your temper!

1029
00:49:24,047 --> 00:49:26,466
Now hold still.

1030
00:49:26,508 --> 00:49:28,343
This might sting a little.

1031
00:49:28,385 --> 00:49:29,469
Hmm?

1032
00:49:30,888 --> 00:49:34,183
By the way, thank you.

1033
00:49:34,224 --> 00:49:36,143
For saving my life.

1034
00:49:39,855 --> 00:49:42,524
You're welcome.

1035
00:49:49,364 --> 00:49:51,325
l don't usually
leave the asylum

1036
00:49:51,408 --> 00:49:52,993
in the middle
of the night

1037
00:49:53,035 --> 00:49:56,205
but he said you'd make it
worth my while.

1038
00:49:57,414 --> 00:49:58,916
Ah.

1039
00:49:58,999 --> 00:50:00,292
l'm listening.

1040
00:50:00,334 --> 00:50:01,752
lt's like this.

1041
00:50:01,793 --> 00:50:04,922
l've got my heart set
on marrying Belle

1042
00:50:04,963 --> 00:50:07,925
but she needs a little...
persuasion.

1043
00:50:09,218 --> 00:50:11,386
Turned him down flat.

1044
00:50:11,428 --> 00:50:13,138
Everyone knows
her father's a lunatic.

1045
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:14,181
He was in here tonight

1046
00:50:14,223 --> 00:50:17,059
raving about a beast
in a castle.

1047
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:18,769
Maurice is harmless.

1048
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:21,480
The point is,
Belle would do anything

1049
00:50:21,522 --> 00:50:23,899
to keep him
from being locked up.

1050
00:50:25,776 --> 00:50:27,277
Yeah. Even marry <i>him.

1051
00:50:29,988 --> 00:50:31,198
So you want me

1052
00:50:31,198 --> 00:50:33,367
to throw her father
into the asylum

1053
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:36,203
unless she agrees
to marry you.

1054
00:50:36,245 --> 00:50:38,497
Oh, that is despicable.

1055
00:50:39,873 --> 00:50:41,250
l love it!

1056
00:50:42,709 --> 00:50:44,962
<i>lf no one will help me

1057
00:50:45,087 --> 00:50:46,713
then l'll go back alone.

1058
00:50:46,755 --> 00:50:48,465
Yes, is that everything?

1059
00:50:48,507 --> 00:50:50,342
l don't care
what it takes.

1060
00:50:50,384 --> 00:50:52,886
l'll find that castle,
and somehow

1061
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:54,763
l'll get her out of there.

1062
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:02,229
Belle? Maurice?

1063
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,188
Oh, well.

1064
00:51:04,231 --> 00:51:06,024
l guess it's not going
to work after all.

1065
00:51:06,066 --> 00:51:08,527
They have to come
back sometime.

1066
00:51:08,569 --> 00:51:12,197
And when they do,
we'll be ready for them.

1067
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:13,574
Lefou...

1068
00:51:13,615 --> 00:51:16,618
don't move
from that spot

1069
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:18,453
until Belle and
her father come home.

1070
00:51:18,495 --> 00:51:20,664
But, but, l...

1071
00:51:22,082 --> 00:51:24,001
Aw, nuts.

1072
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:51,278
l've never felt this way
about anyone.

1073
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,655
l want to do something for her.

1074
00:51:53,697 --> 00:51:55,240
But what?

1075
00:51:55,282 --> 00:51:57,326
Well, there's the usual things.

1076
00:51:57,367 --> 00:51:58,660
Flowers, chocolates.

1077
00:51:58,702 --> 00:52:00,495
Promises you don't intend
to keep.

1078
00:52:00,537 --> 00:52:02,331
Ah, no, no.

1079
00:52:02,372 --> 00:52:04,750
lt has to be something
very special.

1080
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:07,044
Something that sparks
her interest.

1081
00:52:07,085 --> 00:52:08,337
Wait a minute!

1082
00:52:11,173 --> 00:52:15,135
Belle, there's something
l want to show you.

1083
00:52:15,219 --> 00:52:19,264
But first, you have
to close your eyes.

1084
00:52:21,308 --> 00:52:22,809
lt's a surprise.

1085
00:52:34,029 --> 00:52:35,489
Can l open them?

1086
00:52:35,572 --> 00:52:37,533
No, no. Not yet.

1087
00:52:37,574 --> 00:52:40,244
Wait here.

1088
00:52:44,414 --> 00:52:45,874
Now can l open them?

1089
00:52:45,916 --> 00:52:47,543
All right.

1090
00:52:47,584 --> 00:52:48,836
Now.

1091
00:52:57,469 --> 00:52:59,888
l can't believe it!

1092
00:53:00,013 --> 00:53:02,224
l've never seen
so many books in all my life!

1093
00:53:02,266 --> 00:53:03,892
You-You like it?

1094
00:53:03,934 --> 00:53:05,602
lt's wonderful!

1095
00:53:05,644 --> 00:53:07,563
Then it's yours.

1096
00:53:07,604 --> 00:53:09,523
Oh, thank you
so much.

1097
00:53:09,565 --> 00:53:11,233
Oh, would you
look at that!

1098
00:53:11,275 --> 00:53:13,277
l knew it would work.

1099
00:53:13,277 --> 00:53:14,444
What?
What worked?

1100
00:53:14,486 --> 00:53:17,239
lt's very
encouraging.

1101
00:53:17,281 --> 00:53:18,907
lsn't this exciting?

1102
00:53:19,032 --> 00:53:20,409
l didn't see anything.

1103
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:21,577
Come along, Chip.

1104
00:53:21,618 --> 00:53:23,328
There's chores to be done
in the kitchen.

1105
00:53:23,412 --> 00:53:24,788
But what are
they talking about?

1106
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:26,206
What's going on?
Come on, Mom.

1107
00:54:13,629 --> 00:54:15,672
# There's something sweet #

1108
00:54:15,714 --> 00:54:17,382
# And almost kind #

1109
00:54:17,424 --> 00:54:18,634
# But he was mean #

1110
00:54:18,675 --> 00:54:21,011
# And he was coarse
and unrefined #

1111
00:54:21,053 --> 00:54:25,057
# And now he's dear,
and so unsure #

1112
00:54:25,098 --> 00:54:27,726
# l wonder why l didn't see it
there before #

1113
00:54:42,282 --> 00:54:44,535
# She glanced this way #

1114
00:54:44,576 --> 00:54:46,119
# l thought l saw #

1115
00:54:46,203 --> 00:54:47,788
# And when we touched #

1116
00:54:47,829 --> 00:54:49,915
# She didn't shudder
at my paw #

1117
00:54:49,957 --> 00:54:51,625
# No, it can't be #

1118
00:54:51,667 --> 00:54:53,710
# l'll just ignore #

1119
00:54:53,752 --> 00:54:57,756
# But then she's never looked
at me that way before #

1120
00:55:00,342 --> 00:55:06,390
# New and a bit alarming #

1121
00:55:06,431 --> 00:55:14,898
# Who'd have ever thought
that this could be? #

1122
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:21,697
# True that he's no
Prince Charming #

1123
00:55:21,738 --> 00:55:24,366
# But there's something
in him #

1124
00:55:24,408 --> 00:55:29,872
# That l simply didn't see... #

1125
00:55:29,913 --> 00:55:31,081
# Well, who'd
have thought? #

1126
00:55:31,123 --> 00:55:32,082
# Well, bless my soul #

1127
00:55:32,124 --> 00:55:33,250
# Well, who'd
have known? #

1128
00:55:33,292 --> 00:55:34,209
# Well, who indeed? #

1129
00:55:34,251 --> 00:55:35,335
# And who'd
have guessed #

1130
00:55:35,377 --> 00:55:36,795
# They'd come together
on their own? #

1131
00:55:36,837 --> 00:55:37,754
# lt's so peculiar #

1132
00:55:37,796 --> 00:55:38,755
# We'll wait and see #

1133
00:55:38,797 --> 00:55:41,633
# A few days more #

1134
00:55:41,675 --> 00:55:46,096
# There may be something there
that wasn't there before... #

1135
00:55:46,138 --> 00:55:47,931
You know,
perhaps there is

1136
00:55:48,015 --> 00:55:51,143
# Something there
that wasn't there before #

1137
00:55:51,185 --> 00:55:52,895
What?

1138
00:55:52,936 --> 00:55:56,398
# There may be something there
that wasn't there before. #

1139
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,025
What's there, Mama?

1140
00:55:58,066 --> 00:55:59,401
Shh!

1141
00:55:59,443 --> 00:56:01,069
l'll tell you
when you're older.

1142
00:56:03,447 --> 00:56:04,406
Right, then!

1143
00:56:04,448 --> 00:56:06,241
You all know why we're here.

1144
00:56:06,283 --> 00:56:09,786
We have exactly 12 hours,
36 minutes and 15 seconds

1145
00:56:09,828 --> 00:56:11,705
to create the most magical

1146
00:56:11,747 --> 00:56:14,499
spontaneous, romantic atmosphere
known to man or beast.

1147
00:56:15,792 --> 00:56:17,169
"Or beast..."

1148
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:21,590
Right.

1149
00:56:21,632 --> 00:56:23,091
Need l remind you

1150
00:56:23,133 --> 00:56:26,762
that if the last petal falls
from this rose

1151
00:56:26,803 --> 00:56:28,013
the spell will never be...

1152
00:56:28,055 --> 00:56:29,932
broken!

1153
00:56:29,973 --> 00:56:31,433
Very well.

1154
00:56:31,475 --> 00:56:33,477
You all know your assignments.

1155
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:35,437
Half of you to the west wing.

1156
00:56:35,479 --> 00:56:37,314
Half of you to the east wing.

1157
00:56:37,356 --> 00:56:39,399
The rest of you, come with me.

1158
00:56:43,987 --> 00:56:45,447
Oh, lighten up, Cogsworth

1159
00:56:45,489 --> 00:56:47,449
and let nature take its course.

1160
00:56:47,491 --> 00:56:50,160
lt's obvious there's
a spark between them.

1161
00:56:50,202 --> 00:56:54,122
Yes, but there's no harm
in fanning the flames.

1162
00:56:54,164 --> 00:56:55,999
You know... a little.

1163
00:56:55,999 --> 00:56:57,209
Besides, they must fall in love

1164
00:56:57,251 --> 00:56:59,044
tonight if we ever expect
to be human again.

1165
00:56:59,086 --> 00:57:00,504
Ah, human again.

1166
00:57:00,546 --> 00:57:02,089
Human again.

1167
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:05,133
Yes, think
what that means.

1168
00:57:08,053 --> 00:57:10,639
# l'll be cooking again #

1169
00:57:10,681 --> 00:57:12,599
# Be good looking again #

1170
00:57:12,641 --> 00:57:16,436
# With a <i>mademoiselle
on each arm #

1171
00:57:16,478 --> 00:57:19,147
# When l'm human again #

1172
00:57:19,189 --> 00:57:20,816
# Only human again #

1173
00:57:20,858 --> 00:57:24,361
# Poised and polished
and gleaming with charm #

1174
00:57:24,403 --> 00:57:26,154
# l'll be courting again #

1175
00:57:26,196 --> 00:57:28,073
# Chic and sporting again #

1176
00:57:28,115 --> 00:57:31,076
# Which should cause
several husbands alarm #

1177
00:57:31,118 --> 00:57:33,787
# Ha, ha!
l'll hop down off this shelf #

1178
00:57:33,829 --> 00:57:35,664
# And <i>tout de suite be myself #

1179
00:57:35,706 --> 00:57:38,792
# l can't wait
to be human again #

1180
00:57:40,752 --> 00:57:42,921
# When we're human again #

1181
00:57:43,005 --> 00:57:44,798
# Only human again #

1182
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:47,718
# When we're knickknacks
and whatnots no more #

1183
00:57:47,759 --> 00:57:52,598
# When we're human again,
good and human again #

1184
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:55,184
# Oh, <i>cherie,
won't it all be top drawer? #

1185
00:57:55,225 --> 00:57:57,227
# l'll wear lipstick and rouge #

1186
00:57:57,269 --> 00:57:58,604
# And l won't be so huge #

1187
00:57:58,645 --> 00:58:02,274
# Why, l'll easily fit
through that door #

1188
00:58:02,316 --> 00:58:04,193
# l'll exude <i>savoir faire #

1189
00:58:04,234 --> 00:58:06,195
# l'll wear gowns,
l'll have hair #

1190
00:58:06,236 --> 00:58:09,364
# lt's my prayer
to be human again #

1191
00:58:14,494 --> 00:58:16,079
# When we're human again #

1192
00:58:16,121 --> 00:58:17,998
# Only human again #

1193
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:21,376
# When the world once more
starts making sense #

1194
00:58:21,376 --> 00:58:23,003
# l'll unwind, for a change #

1195
00:58:23,086 --> 00:58:24,630
# Really? That'd be strange #

1196
00:58:24,671 --> 00:58:27,883
# Can l help it
if l'm t-t-tense? #

1197
00:58:27,925 --> 00:58:29,384
# ln a shack by the sea #

1198
00:58:29,426 --> 00:58:31,220
# l'll sit back, sipping tea #

1199
00:58:31,261 --> 00:58:34,556
# Let my early
retirement commence #

1200
00:58:34,598 --> 00:58:36,308
# Far from fools made of wax #

1201
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:40,062
# l'll get down to brass tacks
and relax! #

1202
00:58:40,103 --> 00:58:43,815
# When l'm human again #

1203
00:58:43,857 --> 00:58:47,361
# So sweep the dust
from the floor #

1204
00:58:47,402 --> 00:58:50,906
# Let's let some light
in the room #

1205
00:58:50,989 --> 00:58:52,616
# l can feel, l can tell #

1206
00:58:52,658 --> 00:58:55,702
# Someone might break the spell
any day now #

1207
00:58:57,412 --> 00:59:00,874
# Shine up the brass
on the door #

1208
00:59:00,958 --> 00:59:03,752
# Alert the dust pail
and broom #

1209
00:59:03,794 --> 00:59:05,879
# lf it all goes as planned #

1210
00:59:05,921 --> 00:59:11,260
# Our time may be at hand
any day now #

1211
00:59:11,301 --> 00:59:14,680
# Open the shutters,
and let in some air #

1212
00:59:14,721 --> 00:59:18,684
# Put these here,
and put those over there #

1213
00:59:18,725 --> 00:59:22,104
# Sweep up the years
of sadness and tears #

1214
00:59:22,145 --> 00:59:24,857
# And throw them away #

1215
00:59:30,988 --> 00:59:33,740
# We'll be human again #

1216
00:59:33,782 --> 00:59:35,951
# Only human again #

1217
00:59:35,993 --> 00:59:38,662
# When the girl
finally sets us all free #

1218
00:59:38,704 --> 00:59:41,248
# Cheeks a-blooming again #

1219
00:59:41,331 --> 00:59:43,166
# We're assuming again #

1220
00:59:43,208 --> 00:59:46,170
# We'll resume our
long lost <i>joie de vivre #

1221
00:59:46,211 --> 00:59:47,421
# We'll be playing again #

1222
00:59:47,462 --> 00:59:49,756
# Holidaying again #

1223
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:51,800
# And we're praying
it's ASAP #

1224
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:54,970
# We will push, we will shove #

1225
00:59:55,095 --> 00:59:56,930
# They will both fall in love #

1226
00:59:57,014 --> 01:00:00,809
# And we'll finally
be human again... #

1227
01:00:02,477 --> 01:00:04,938
For never was a story
of more woe

1228
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:07,566
Than this of Juliet
and her Romeo.

1229
01:00:08,984 --> 01:00:11,486
Could you read it again?

1230
01:00:11,528 --> 01:00:13,697
Well, here, why don't
you read it to me?

1231
01:00:13,739 --> 01:00:15,908
Uh, all right.

1232
01:00:15,949 --> 01:00:18,827
Uh...

1233
01:00:18,827 --> 01:00:20,954
Uh... l can't.

1234
01:00:20,996 --> 01:00:23,707
You mean,
you never learned?

1235
01:00:23,749 --> 01:00:25,959
l learned... a little.

1236
01:00:26,001 --> 01:00:28,670
lt's just been so long.

1237
01:00:28,712 --> 01:00:30,964
Well, here, l'll help you.

1238
01:00:31,048 --> 01:00:32,633
Let's start here.

1239
01:00:32,674 --> 01:00:35,385
Here.

1240
01:00:35,427 --> 01:00:37,387
Okay, "Twoe..."

1241
01:00:37,429 --> 01:00:38,388
"Two."

1242
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:40,557
"Two... l knew that.

1243
01:00:40,599 --> 01:00:43,268
Two households..."

1244
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:47,356
# We'll be dancing again #

1245
01:00:47,397 --> 01:00:49,066
# We'll be twirling again #

1246
01:00:49,107 --> 01:00:52,653
# We'll be whirling around
with such ease #

1247
01:00:52,694 --> 01:00:53,987
# When we're human again #

1248
01:00:54,071 --> 01:00:55,697
# Only human again #

1249
01:00:55,739 --> 01:00:59,409
# We'll go waltzing
those old one, two, threes #

1250
01:00:59,451 --> 01:01:01,370
# We'll be floating again #

1251
01:01:01,411 --> 01:01:02,704
# We'll be gliding again #

1252
01:01:02,704 --> 01:01:06,375
# Stepping, striding
as fine as you please #

1253
01:01:06,416 --> 01:01:09,753
# Like a real human does #

1254
01:01:09,795 --> 01:01:13,340
# l'll be all that l was #

1255
01:01:13,382 --> 01:01:17,886
# On that glorious morn
when we're finally reborn #

1256
01:01:17,928 --> 01:01:21,515
# And we're all #

1257
01:01:21,557 --> 01:01:26,770
# Human again! #

1258
01:01:39,491 --> 01:01:42,452
Tonight is
the night.

1259
01:01:42,494 --> 01:01:45,247
l'm not sure l can do this.

1260
01:01:45,289 --> 01:01:46,874
You don't have time to be timid.

1261
01:01:46,915 --> 01:01:49,209
You must be bold, daring.

1262
01:01:49,251 --> 01:01:50,961
Bold, daring.

1263
01:01:53,881 --> 01:01:56,133
There will be music...

1264
01:01:56,175 --> 01:01:58,594
romantic candlelight...

1265
01:01:58,594 --> 01:02:00,596
provided by myself.

1266
01:02:00,596 --> 01:02:02,097
And when the moment
is right

1267
01:02:02,139 --> 01:02:03,932
you confess your love.

1268
01:02:03,932 --> 01:02:05,934
Yes, l con...

1269
01:02:05,976 --> 01:02:08,812
l-l... No, l can't.

1270
01:02:08,854 --> 01:02:10,272
You care for the girl,
don't you?

1271
01:02:10,314 --> 01:02:12,608
More than anything.

1272
01:02:12,608 --> 01:02:14,359
Well, then,
you must tell her.

1273
01:02:16,445 --> 01:02:17,779
<i>Voila!

1274
01:02:17,779 --> 01:02:20,115
Oh, you look so... so...

1275
01:02:20,157 --> 01:02:22,117
Stupid.

1276
01:02:22,117 --> 01:02:25,245
Not quite the word
l was looking for.

1277
01:02:25,329 --> 01:02:27,331
Perhaps a little more
off the top?

1278
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:33,128
Your lady awaits.

1279
01:02:57,778 --> 01:03:02,991
# Tale as old as time #

1280
01:03:03,033 --> 01:03:07,246
# True as it can be #

1281
01:03:08,455 --> 01:03:11,458
# Barely even friends #

1282
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:14,086
# Then somebody bends #

1283
01:03:14,127 --> 01:03:16,004
# Unexpectedly #

1284
01:03:17,714 --> 01:03:20,425
# Just a little change #

1285
01:03:23,554 --> 01:03:26,181
# Small, to say the least #

1286
01:03:26,223 --> 01:03:28,809
# Both a little scared #

1287
01:03:28,851 --> 01:03:32,020
# Neither one prepared #

1288
01:03:32,062 --> 01:03:34,857
# Beauty and the Beast #

1289
01:03:37,734 --> 01:03:39,611
# Ever just the same #

1290
01:03:42,739 --> 01:03:45,325
# Ever a surprise #

1291
01:03:45,367 --> 01:03:47,494
Huh? Huh? Huh?

1292
01:03:47,578 --> 01:03:50,289
# Ever as before #

1293
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:52,708
# Ever just as sure #

1294
01:03:52,749 --> 01:03:56,295
# As the sun will rise #

1295
01:03:57,796 --> 01:04:02,551
# Tale as old as time #

1296
01:04:02,593 --> 01:04:07,181
# Tune as old as song #

1297
01:04:07,222 --> 01:04:10,392
# Bittersweet and strange #

1298
01:04:10,434 --> 01:04:12,895
# Finding you can change #

1299
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:15,898
# Learning you were wrong #

1300
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:22,571
# Certain as the sun #

1301
01:04:22,613 --> 01:04:25,532
# Rising in the east #

1302
01:04:25,574 --> 01:04:27,784
# Tale as old as time #

1303
01:04:27,826 --> 01:04:30,579
# Song as old as rhyme #

1304
01:04:30,621 --> 01:04:33,665
# Beauty and the Beast #

1305
01:04:33,707 --> 01:04:35,459
Shh!

1306
01:04:36,627 --> 01:04:40,214
# Tale as old as time #

1307
01:04:40,255 --> 01:04:44,426
# Song as old as rhyme #

1308
01:04:44,468 --> 01:04:51,600
# Beauty and the Beast. #

1309
01:04:51,642 --> 01:04:53,810
Off to the cupboard
with you now, Chip.

1310
01:04:53,852 --> 01:04:55,187
lt's past your bedtime.

1311
01:04:57,606 --> 01:04:59,983
Good night, love.

1312
01:05:23,423 --> 01:05:26,927
Belle?

1313
01:05:26,969 --> 01:05:30,556
Are you... happy
here with me?

1314
01:05:30,597 --> 01:05:32,474
Yes.

1315
01:05:36,478 --> 01:05:38,939
What is it?

1316
01:05:38,981 --> 01:05:41,692
lf only l could see
my father again

1317
01:05:41,733 --> 01:05:43,360
just for a moment.

1318
01:05:43,402 --> 01:05:44,820
l miss him so much.

1319
01:05:50,409 --> 01:05:53,328
There is a way.

1320
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:57,124
This mirror will show
you anything...

1321
01:05:57,165 --> 01:06:00,586
anything
you wish to see.

1322
01:06:00,627 --> 01:06:03,463
l'd like to see
my father, please.

1323
01:06:10,345 --> 01:06:11,555
Papa?

1324
01:06:11,597 --> 01:06:12,848
Oh, no.

1325
01:06:12,848 --> 01:06:15,142
He's sick.

1326
01:06:15,184 --> 01:06:16,810
He may be dying

1327
01:06:16,852 --> 01:06:18,812
and he's all alone.

1328
01:06:24,026 --> 01:06:27,487
Then, you must go to him.

1329
01:06:27,529 --> 01:06:28,822
What did you say?

1330
01:06:28,864 --> 01:06:29,907
l release you.

1331
01:06:29,948 --> 01:06:32,367
You are no longer my prisoner.

1332
01:06:32,409 --> 01:06:33,869
You mean...

1333
01:06:33,869 --> 01:06:35,037
l'm free?

1334
01:06:35,078 --> 01:06:37,164
Yes.

1335
01:06:37,206 --> 01:06:39,374
Oh, thank you.

1336
01:06:39,416 --> 01:06:41,585
Hold on, Papa.

1337
01:06:41,627 --> 01:06:43,879
l'm on my way.

1338
01:06:43,921 --> 01:06:45,714
Take it with you

1339
01:06:45,756 --> 01:06:50,177
so you'll always have
a way to look back

1340
01:06:50,219 --> 01:06:52,054
and remember me.

1341
01:06:54,723 --> 01:06:56,308
Thank you for
understanding

1342
01:06:56,350 --> 01:06:57,684
how much he needs me.

1343
01:07:06,318 --> 01:07:08,487
Well, Your Highness,
l must say

1344
01:07:08,529 --> 01:07:11,073
everything is going
just swimmingly.

1345
01:07:11,114 --> 01:07:12,282
l knew you had it in you.

1346
01:07:13,617 --> 01:07:15,118
l let her go.

1347
01:07:16,495 --> 01:07:17,829
Yes, yes.

1348
01:07:17,871 --> 01:07:18,872
Splen...

1349
01:07:18,997 --> 01:07:21,917
You what?

1350
01:07:21,959 --> 01:07:23,460
How could you do that?

1351
01:07:23,502 --> 01:07:24,920
l had to.

1352
01:07:25,003 --> 01:07:26,004
Yes, but...

1353
01:07:27,047 --> 01:07:27,923
Why?

1354
01:07:28,006 --> 01:07:31,718
Because... l love her.

1355
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,220
He did what?

1356
01:07:33,262 --> 01:07:34,471
Yes.

1357
01:07:34,513 --> 01:07:36,223
l'm afraid it's true.

1358
01:07:36,265 --> 01:07:37,683
She's going away?

1359
01:07:37,724 --> 01:07:39,768
But he was so close.

1360
01:07:39,810 --> 01:07:41,562
After all this time

1361
01:07:41,603 --> 01:07:44,273
he's finally learned to love.

1362
01:07:44,314 --> 01:07:47,025
That's it, then.
That should break the spell.

1363
01:07:47,067 --> 01:07:48,610
But it's not enough.

1364
01:07:48,652 --> 01:07:51,071
She has to love him
in return.

1365
01:07:51,113 --> 01:07:54,408
Now it's too late.

1366
01:08:02,916 --> 01:08:05,752
Papa! Papa!

1367
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:20,851
Ooh.

1368
01:08:20,893 --> 01:08:23,020
They're back.

1369
01:08:24,313 --> 01:08:25,564
Belle?

1370
01:08:25,606 --> 01:08:26,607
Shh.

1371
01:08:26,648 --> 01:08:28,025
lt's all right, Papa.

1372
01:08:28,066 --> 01:08:30,152
l'm home.

1373
01:08:30,194 --> 01:08:31,403
l thought l'd never

1374
01:08:31,445 --> 01:08:33,989
see you again.

1375
01:08:34,031 --> 01:08:35,908
l missed you so much.

1376
01:08:35,991 --> 01:08:36,909
but the Beast?

1377
01:08:36,992 --> 01:08:38,911
Did you...
How did you escape?

1378
01:08:38,952 --> 01:08:40,245
l didn't escape, Papa.

1379
01:08:40,287 --> 01:08:41,496
He let me go.

1380
01:08:41,538 --> 01:08:42,915
That horrible beast?

1381
01:08:42,998 --> 01:08:46,043
But he's different now, Papa.

1382
01:08:46,084 --> 01:08:48,337
He's changed somehow.

1383
01:08:52,382 --> 01:08:53,634
Hi.

1384
01:08:53,675 --> 01:08:56,553
Oh. A stowaway.

1385
01:08:56,595 --> 01:09:00,057
Why, hello there, little fella.

1386
01:09:00,098 --> 01:09:01,892
Didn't think
l'd see you again.

1387
01:09:01,934 --> 01:09:03,435
Belle, why'd you go away?

1388
01:09:03,477 --> 01:09:05,062
Don't you like us anymore?

1389
01:09:05,103 --> 01:09:07,231
Oh, Chip, of course l do.

1390
01:09:07,272 --> 01:09:08,607
lt's just...

1391
01:09:13,237 --> 01:09:14,446
May l help you?

1392
01:09:14,488 --> 01:09:16,406
l've come to collect
your father.

1393
01:09:16,448 --> 01:09:17,950
My father?

1394
01:09:17,991 --> 01:09:19,952
Don't worry, <i>Mademoiselle.

1395
01:09:19,993 --> 01:09:22,204
We'll take good care of him.

1396
01:09:23,539 --> 01:09:24,706
My father's not crazy.

1397
01:09:24,748 --> 01:09:26,583
He was raving like a lunatic.

1398
01:09:26,625 --> 01:09:28,418
We all heard him, didn't we?

1399
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:32,965
No, l won't let you.

1400
01:09:33,048 --> 01:09:33,966
Belle?

1401
01:09:34,007 --> 01:09:36,677
Maurice, tell us again, old man.

1402
01:09:36,718 --> 01:09:38,679
Just how big
was the beast?

1403
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:43,976
He was... l mean, he was...
he was... enormous.

1404
01:09:44,059 --> 01:09:45,769
l-l'd say
at least eight...

1405
01:09:45,811 --> 01:09:47,229
No, more like ten feet.

1406
01:09:48,230 --> 01:09:52,317
Well, you don't get
much crazier than that.

1407
01:09:53,610 --> 01:09:55,821
lt's true, l tell you.

1408
01:09:55,863 --> 01:09:57,781
Get him
out of here.

1409
01:09:57,823 --> 01:09:59,157
Let go of me.

1410
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:00,284
No!

1411
01:10:00,325 --> 01:10:02,369
You can't do this.

1412
01:10:02,411 --> 01:10:03,579
Poor Belle.

1413
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:06,081
lt's a shame
about your father.

1414
01:10:06,123 --> 01:10:07,875
You know he's
not crazy, Gaston.

1415
01:10:07,916 --> 01:10:10,794
Hmm, l might be able
to clear up this...

1416
01:10:10,836 --> 01:10:12,588
little misunderstanding.

1417
01:10:12,588 --> 01:10:13,714
lf...

1418
01:10:13,755 --> 01:10:14,590
lf what?

1419
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:16,550
lf you marry me.

1420
01:10:16,592 --> 01:10:17,551
What?

1421
01:10:17,593 --> 01:10:19,219
One little word, Belle.
That's all it takes.

1422
01:10:19,261 --> 01:10:20,262
Never.

1423
01:10:20,304 --> 01:10:21,930
Have it your way.

1424
01:10:22,014 --> 01:10:22,806
Belle.

1425
01:10:24,474 --> 01:10:26,059
Let go of me.

1426
01:10:26,101 --> 01:10:27,519
My father's not crazy

1427
01:10:27,561 --> 01:10:28,729
and l can prove it.

1428
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:30,981
Show me the Beast.

1429
01:10:35,611 --> 01:10:36,945
ls it dangerous?

1430
01:10:37,029 --> 01:10:39,823
Oh, no, no, he'd
never hurt anyone.

1431
01:10:39,865 --> 01:10:42,284
Please, l know he looks vicious

1432
01:10:42,326 --> 01:10:43,952
but he's really
kind and gentle.

1433
01:10:44,077 --> 01:10:45,579
He's my friend.

1434
01:10:45,621 --> 01:10:46,830
lf l didn't know better

1435
01:10:46,872 --> 01:10:49,416
l'd think you had feelings
for this monster.

1436
01:10:49,458 --> 01:10:52,002
He's no monster, Gaston.
You are.

1437
01:10:53,212 --> 01:10:56,256
She's as crazy
as the old man.

1438
01:10:56,256 --> 01:10:59,635
The Beast will make off
with your children.

1439
01:10:59,635 --> 01:11:00,511
-He'll come after them
in the night.
-No!

1440
01:11:00,552 --> 01:11:01,512
We're not safe

1441
01:11:01,553 --> 01:11:03,096
till his head
is mounted on my wall.

1442
01:11:03,138 --> 01:11:04,932
l say we kill the Beast!

1443
01:11:05,974 --> 01:11:07,809
# We're not safe
until he's dead #

1444
01:11:07,809 --> 01:11:09,436
# He'll come stalking us
at night #

1445
01:11:09,478 --> 01:11:11,355
# Set to sacrifice
our children #

1446
01:11:11,396 --> 01:11:13,148
# To his monstrous appetite #

1447
01:11:13,190 --> 01:11:15,025
# He'll wreak havoc
on our village #

1448
01:11:15,067 --> 01:11:16,610
# lf we let him wander free #

1449
01:11:16,652 --> 01:11:20,322
# So it's time to take
some action, boys #

1450
01:11:20,364 --> 01:11:25,494
# lt's time to follow me #

1451
01:11:27,246 --> 01:11:29,122
# Through the mist,
through the woods #

1452
01:11:29,164 --> 01:11:30,958
# Through the darkness
and the shadows #

1453
01:11:31,041 --> 01:11:33,418
# lt's a nightmare,
but it's one exciting ride #

1454
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:36,880
# Say a prayer, then we're there
at the drawbridge of a castle #

1455
01:11:36,922 --> 01:11:40,342
# And there's something
truly terrible inside #

1456
01:11:40,384 --> 01:11:43,095
# lt's a beast, he's got fangs,
razor-sharp ones #

1457
01:11:43,136 --> 01:11:46,473
# Massive paws, killer claws
for the feast #

1458
01:11:46,515 --> 01:11:48,475
# Hear him roar, see him foam #

1459
01:11:48,517 --> 01:11:50,185
# But we're not coming home #

1460
01:11:50,227 --> 01:11:51,645
# Till he's dead #

1461
01:11:51,687 --> 01:11:53,397
# Good and dead #

1462
01:11:53,438 --> 01:11:54,523
# Kill the Beast! #

1463
01:11:54,565 --> 01:11:56,149
No, l won't
let you do this.

1464
01:11:56,191 --> 01:11:58,735
lf you're not with us,
you're against us.

1465
01:11:58,777 --> 01:11:59,820
Bring the old man.

1466
01:11:59,862 --> 01:12:01,488
Get your hands off me.

1467
01:12:01,530 --> 01:12:03,907
We can't have them running off
to warn the creature.

1468
01:12:04,032 --> 01:12:05,284
Let us out!

1469
01:12:05,325 --> 01:12:08,036
We'll rid the village
of this beast.

1470
01:12:08,036 --> 01:12:09,079
Who's with me?

1471
01:12:10,706 --> 01:12:12,749
# Raise your torch,
mount your horse #

1472
01:12:12,791 --> 01:12:15,127
# Screw your courage
to the sticking place #

1473
01:12:15,169 --> 01:12:17,588
# We're counting on Gaston
to lead the way #

1474
01:12:17,629 --> 01:12:19,423
# Through the mist,
through the wood #

1475
01:12:19,464 --> 01:12:21,091
# Where,
within a haunted castle #

1476
01:12:21,133 --> 01:12:23,760
# Something's lurking
that you don't see every day #

1477
01:12:23,802 --> 01:12:27,347
# lt's a beast,
one as tall as a mountain #

1478
01:12:27,389 --> 01:12:30,559
# We won't rest
till he's good and deceased #

1479
01:12:30,601 --> 01:12:32,394
# Sally forth, tally ho #

1480
01:12:32,436 --> 01:12:34,062
# Grab your sword,
grab your bow #

1481
01:12:34,104 --> 01:12:35,606
# Praise the lord,
and here we go. #

1482
01:12:35,647 --> 01:12:39,067
We'll lay siege to the castle
and bring back his head!

1483
01:12:39,109 --> 01:12:41,403
l have to warn the Beast.

1484
01:12:41,403 --> 01:12:43,322
This is all my fault.

1485
01:12:43,363 --> 01:12:45,282
Oh, Papa, what are
we going to do?

1486
01:12:45,324 --> 01:12:46,658
Now, now.

1487
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:48,202
We'll think of something.

1488
01:12:51,288 --> 01:12:52,497
Ah!

1489
01:12:55,417 --> 01:12:57,836
# We don't like
what we don't understand #

1490
01:12:57,878 --> 01:12:59,588
# ln fact, it scares us #

1491
01:12:59,630 --> 01:13:02,216
# And this monster
is mysterious at least #

1492
01:13:02,257 --> 01:13:03,759
# Bring your guns,
bring your knives #

1493
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,344
# Save your children
and your wives #

1494
01:13:05,385 --> 01:13:08,472
# We'll save our village
and our lives #

1495
01:13:08,514 --> 01:13:09,932
# We'll kill the Beast! #

1496
01:13:10,015 --> 01:13:11,433
l knew it.

1497
01:13:11,433 --> 01:13:13,852
l knew it was foolish
to get our hopes up.

1498
01:13:13,894 --> 01:13:16,647
Maybe it would have been better
if she'd never come at all.

1499
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:19,191
Could it be?

1500
01:13:19,233 --> 01:13:20,025
ls it she?

1501
01:13:20,067 --> 01:13:21,443

Encroachers.

1504
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:25,197
And they have
the mirror.

1505
01:13:25,239 --> 01:13:26,240
Warn the master.

1506
01:13:26,281 --> 01:13:28,242
lf it's a fight they want,
we'll be ready for them.

1507
01:13:28,283 --> 01:13:29,243
Who's with me?

1508
01:13:29,284 --> 01:13:30,285
Ah!

1509
01:13:30,327 --> 01:13:32,329
Take whatever booty
you can find

1510
01:13:32,371 --> 01:13:35,457
but remember,
the Beast is mine!

1511

# Lights ablaze, banners high #

1512
01:13:37,292 --> 01:13:38,961

# Let's kill the Beast! #

1518
01:13:50,222 --> 01:13:53,392
-Pardon me, Master?
-Leave me in peace.

1519
01:13:53,433 --> 01:13:55,936
But, sir, the castle
is under attack.

1520
01:13:57,271 --> 01:13:59,106
Kill the Beast!
Kill the Beast!

1521
01:13:59,147 --> 01:14:00,899
This isn't working.

1522
01:14:00,983 --> 01:14:03,443
Oh, Lumiere,
we must do something.

1523
01:14:03,485 --> 01:14:05,904
Wait, l know.

1524
01:14:08,282 --> 01:14:11,118
What shall
we do, Master?

1525
01:14:11,159 --> 01:14:13,662
lt doesn't matter now.

1526
01:14:13,704 --> 01:14:15,789
Just let them come.

1527
01:14:15,831 --> 01:14:19,168
Kill the Beast!
Kill the Beast!

1528
01:14:19,168 --> 01:14:20,377
Kill the Beast!

1529
01:14:33,348 --> 01:14:34,016
Now!

1530
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:56,371
Yes!

1531
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,668
Here we go.

1532
01:15:05,005 --> 01:15:06,590
What the devil?

1533
01:15:07,716 --> 01:15:08,967
Belle, look out!

1534
01:15:15,224 --> 01:15:18,352
You guys got to try this thing.

1535
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:24,733
Up here

1536
01:15:24,733 --> 01:15:27,069

1537
01:15:45,462 --> 01:15:46,755
Oh!

1538
01:16:37,139 --> 01:16:39,600
And stay out!

1539
01:16:41,476 --> 01:16:43,103
Eww!

1541
01:17:11,673 --> 01:17:14,343
Get up!

1542
01:17:14,384 --> 01:17:16,428
What's the matter, Beast?

1543
01:17:17,846 --> 01:17:20,766
Too kind and gentle
to fight back?

1544
01:17:27,397 --> 01:17:28,815
No!

1545
01:17:32,444 --> 01:17:33,195
Belle...

1546
01:17:33,195 --> 01:17:35,656
No! Gaston, don't!

1547
01:17:41,411 --> 01:17:42,788
Let's go, Philippe.

1548
01:18:07,896 --> 01:18:09,565
Come on out and fight!

1549
01:18:12,150 --> 01:18:15,070
Were you in love with her,
Beast?

1550
01:18:15,112 --> 01:18:17,906
Did you honestly think
she'd want you

1551
01:18:17,948 --> 01:18:20,325
when she had someone like me?

1552
01:18:31,211 --> 01:18:33,881
lt's over, Beast.

1553
01:18:33,922 --> 01:18:35,632
Belle is mine!

1554
01:18:41,096 --> 01:18:42,723
Let me go. Let me go.

1555
01:18:42,764 --> 01:18:44,474
Please, don't hurt me.

1556
01:18:44,516 --> 01:18:45,559

01:18:45,601 --> 01:18:47,227
Anything!

1558
01:19:00,616 --> 01:19:03,327
Get out.

1559
01:19:03,368 --> 01:19:05,579
Beast!

1560
01:19:05,621 --> 01:19:06,747
Belle?

1561
01:19:14,671 --> 01:19:16,882
Belle?

1562
01:19:22,638 --> 01:19:24,973
You came back.

1563

You...

1564
01:20:06,139 --> 01:20:07,808
You came back.

1565
01:20:07,850 --> 01:20:09,476
Of course l came back.

1566
01:20:09,518 --> 01:20:11,311
l couldn't let them...

1567
01:20:11,353 --> 01:20:13,272
Oh, this is all my fault.

1568
01:20:13,313 --> 01:20:15,691

here sooner.

1569
01:20:15,732 --> 01:20:19,236

01:20:19,278 --> 01:20:20,571
it's better this way.

1571
01:20:20,612 --> 01:20:22,948
Don't talk like that.

1572
01:20:22,990 --> 01:20:24,616
You'll be all right.

1573
01:20:25,826 --> 01:20:26,827
We're together now.

1574
01:20:26,869 --> 01:20:28,328
Everything's
going to be fine.

1575
01:20:28,370 --> 01:20:30,539
You'll see.

1576
01:20:30,581 --> 01:20:33,876
And... at least...

1577
01:20:33,876 --> 01:20:36,628
l got to see you...

1578
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:38,380

1579
01:20:49,099 --> 01:20:50,726
No. No.

01:20:54,771 --> 01:20:56,732
Please, don't leave me.

01:26:08,252 --> 01:26:14,550
# Just a little change #

1624
01:26:14,591 --> 01:26:17,886
# Small to say the least #

1625
01:26:17,886 --> 01:26:20,889
# Both a little scared #

1626
01:26:20,889 --> 01:26:24,268
# Neither one prepared #

1627
01:26:24,309 --> 01:26:29,731
# Beauty and the Beast #

1628
01:26:29,731 --> 01:26:36,154
# Ever just the same #

1629
01:26:36,196 --> 01:26:42,494
# Ever a surprise #

1630
01:26:42,536 --> 01:26:45,789
# Ever as before #

1631
01:26:45,831 --> 01:26:48,834
# And ever just as sure #

1632
01:26:48,876 --> 01:26:53,714
# As the sun will rise #

1633
01:26:53,755 --> 01:26:57,050
# Whoa, oh-oh #

1634
01:26:57,092 --> 01:26:59,887
# Whoa, oh #

1635
01:27:16,612 --> 01:27:19,907
# Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh #

1636
01:27:19,948 --> 01:27:26,580
# Ever just the same #

1637
01:27:26,622 --> 01:27:32,544
# Ever a surprise #

1638
01:27:32,586 --> 01:27:35,547
# Ever as before #

1639
01:27:35,589 --> 01:27:38,550
# Ever just as sure #

1640
01:27:38,592 --> 01:27:42,888
# As the sun will rise #

1641
01:27:42,930 --> 01:27:48,268
# Oh, oh, oh... #

1642
01:27:48,310 --> 01:27:54,775
# Tale as old as time #

1643
01:27:54,816 --> 01:28:00,864
# Tune as old as song #

1644
01:28:00,948 --> 01:28:03,867
# Bittersweet and strange #

1645
01:28:03,951 --> 01:28:06,870
# Finding you can change #

1646
01:28:06,995 --> 01:28:13,252
# Learning you were wrong #

1647
01:28:13,293 --> 01:28:16,588
# Certain as the sun #

1648
01:28:16,630 --> 01:28:19,883
# Certain as the sun #

1649
01:28:19,967 --> 01:28:22,886
# Rising in the east #

1650
01:28:22,928 --> 01:28:25,597
# Tale as old as time #

1651
01:28:25,639 --> 01:28:28,642
# Song as old as rhyme #

1652
01:28:28,684 --> 01:28:34,898
# Beauty and the Beast #

1653
01:28:34,940 --> 01:28:38,277
# Tale as old as time #

1654
01:28:38,318 --> 01:28:41,905
# Song as old as rhyme #

1655
01:28:41,989 --> 01:28:52,916
# Beauty and the Beast #

1656
01:28:52,958 --> 01:28:56,753
# Oh, oh-oh-oh #

1657
01:28:56,795 --> 01:29:00,591
# Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh #

1658
01:29:05,429 --> 01:29:09,641
# Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm #

1659
01:29:12,644 --> 01:29:27,201
# Beauty and the Beast. #
