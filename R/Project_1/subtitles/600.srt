1
00:01:03,324 --> 00:01:05,958
Agua. As in water.

2
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:08,879
Cute. But I wasn't here for cute.

3
00:01:09,538 --> 00:01:14,592
I was here because I'd gotten
a call for my regular fee.

4
00:01:15,176 --> 00:01:15,915
$4.99.

5
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:16,815
$4.99.

6
00:01:16,816 --> 00:01:17,716
$4.99.

7
00:01:18,313 --> 00:01:20,541
I am an ex-secret agent.

8
00:01:20,542 --> 00:01:23,758
My name is Juni Cortez.

9
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,731
And I am a private detective.
A P.I. A private eye.

10
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:32,192
A gumshoe.

11
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:39,882
I know why the water
from your park is missing.

12
00:01:39,883 --> 00:01:42,692
- Pray tell.
- It's winter.

13
00:01:42,693 --> 00:01:45,620
They shut down the park
during the winter.

14
00:01:45,621 --> 00:01:47,664
Who's "they"?

15
00:01:47,665 --> 00:01:52,252
The people who really own this park.

16
00:01:53,812 --> 00:01:55,354
Times are tough.

17
00:01:55,355 --> 00:01:58,107
But a guy's got to do
what he's got to do.

18
00:01:58,108 --> 00:02:00,685
From saving cats in trees....

19
00:02:03,053 --> 00:02:06,306
to finding lost toys.

20
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:13,847
- To helping people...
- Hold on. Yeah?

21
00:02:14,222 --> 00:02:16,290
The OSS is looking for me?

22
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:19,897
Look, I am no longer an agent.
I can't help you.

23
00:02:19,898 --> 00:02:22,238
Whatever it is, it's your problem.

24
00:02:22,738 --> 00:02:24,607
Leave me alone!

25
00:02:26,367 --> 00:02:30,246
I'd been burned by the agency.
The OSS.

26
00:02:30,546 --> 00:02:33,674
So I left. No going back.

27
00:02:34,174 --> 00:02:36,751
I handle my own assignments now.

28
00:02:37,251 --> 00:02:39,212
Smaller in scale.

29
00:02:39,587 --> 00:02:41,923
I was saving up for something big.

30
00:02:42,223 --> 00:02:47,502
I was standing in line to buy my copy of the
biggest virtual-reality game in history.

31
00:02:47,503 --> 00:02:52,166
It goes online at midnight.
Pretty exciting. I suppose.

32
00:02:52,466 --> 00:02:53,366
Game Over.

33
00:02:53,367 --> 00:02:53,966
Game Over.

34
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:56,760
The biggest video game
to ever be created. Period.

35
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:58,329
This is a worldwide event.

36
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:02,224
The game was created by someone
known only as the Toymaker.

37
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:05,903
Who was once again
unavailable for interviews.

38
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:12,910
But there's got to be some things
more important than games.

39
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:21,041
Oh. And did we mention
the surprises the Toymaker has in store

40
00:03:21,042 --> 00:03:24,661
for those of you that complete level five?

41
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:31,467
Untold riches. Toys. And prizes
beyond your wildest dreams.

42
00:03:31,468 --> 00:03:33,927
Hey, no cutting in line, freak.

43
00:03:33,928 --> 00:03:36,171
I wasn't cutting.
I was standing right here!

44
00:03:36,172 --> 00:03:38,266
End of the line!

45
00:03:39,142 --> 00:03:40,801
Needless to say.

46
00:03:40,802 --> 00:03:44,355
Things have been pretty lame
since I left the OSS.

47
00:03:45,189 --> 00:03:46,690
Aah...

48
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:50,786
Things were about to get worse.

49
00:04:01,763 --> 00:04:02,788
Dear Juni.

50
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:05,974
I was doing some work
and thought you might like these.

51
00:04:05,975 --> 00:04:08,686
Miniaturized sharks.

52
00:04:09,086 --> 00:04:12,798
Remember. They're still man-eaters. So
don't be poking your fingers in the bowl.

53
00:04:13,448 --> 00:04:17,436
Take care. If you guys ever need anything.
I will be there.

54
00:04:17,836 --> 00:04:18,694
"Romero".

55
00:04:18,695 --> 00:04:22,223
Ralph, write a thank-you note
back to Romero.

56
00:04:33,767 --> 00:04:36,153
Behave, you guys.
No fighting.

57
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:49,764
- What are you doing?
- Hi, Gerti.

58
00:04:49,765 --> 00:04:53,539
I am just doing nothing... again.

59
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,212
- What's that?
- Mexican chocolate.

60
00:04:57,981 --> 00:05:00,707
- Where's your mom and dad?
- On an assignment.

61
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,944
It was my idea not to be
part of the family business.

62
00:05:03,945 --> 00:05:07,030
They're all on missions.
Your sister, too, huh?

63
00:05:07,031 --> 00:05:10,917
I haven't seen Carmen
since Christmas... last year.

64
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:13,995
You should join back up.
The OSS could really use you.

65
00:05:13,996 --> 00:05:16,830
- Yeah. Use me.
- Not what I meant.

66
00:05:16,831 --> 00:05:19,374
Don't hold on to the past, Juni.
Look at me.

67
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,718
9 years old and nowhere to go but up.

68
00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:26,131
The only tribe worth belonging to
is the one that you're born into.

69
00:05:26,132 --> 00:05:29,133
Yeah, your family.
It's good to take care of your family.

70
00:05:29,134 --> 00:05:31,385
But remember one thing.

71
00:05:31,386 --> 00:05:33,205
Everyone's your family.

72
00:05:35,015 --> 00:05:37,767
That makes no sense.

73
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,422
Hello, Juni.

74
00:05:44,423 --> 00:05:45,749
Mr. President.

75
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,925
Oh, you can call me Devlin.

76
00:05:47,926 --> 00:05:51,495
Weren't you already running the country
when you were head of the OSS? Well,

77
00:05:51,496 --> 00:05:52,688
I was running the country.

78
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:56,859
But since the OSS is a secret
organization, no one knew it.

79
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,261
I wanted the world to know
that I was in charge.

80
00:05:59,262 --> 00:06:01,805
So I became president
of the United States.

81
00:06:01,806 --> 00:06:07,568
It all depends upon your preference. Reality
or perception. Perception works for me.

82
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:09,987
Well, I am into reality.

83
00:06:09,988 --> 00:06:12,415
And the reality is, nothing you can say

84
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:16,794
will make me re-join the OSS.
That is why you called, isn't it?

85
00:06:16,795 --> 00:06:19,079
The OSS needs you to return.

86
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,774
I am retired.
Well, who's living in perception now?

87
00:06:22,775 --> 00:06:24,968
The fact is there is no retirement.

88
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:29,097
Once an agent, always an agent. Now, it's
time for you to be a big boy and reinstate.

89
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:32,641
With all due respect, sir, no.

90
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:39,098
Well, then hold on to your seat, because
here's the reality: Your sister's missing.

91
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:50,875
Taking Agent Cortez to Games and Theory.

92
00:06:50,876 --> 00:06:53,895
That's ex-Agent Cortez.

93
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,658
You know, that one's defective. It's...

94
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:02,444
Something's wrong with the shape.
There's got a....

95
00:07:02,445 --> 00:07:04,745
See if we can take that one back.

96
00:07:08,917 --> 00:07:10,584
Oh, man.

97
00:07:10,585 --> 00:07:11,877
We're on.

98
00:07:11,878 --> 00:07:13,338
We're on.

99
00:07:18,342 --> 00:07:19,518
Hello, Juni.

100
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:22,395
Donnagon. Been a good boy lately?

101
00:07:22,396 --> 00:07:23,548
Yes.

102
00:07:23,549 --> 00:07:25,591
Very, very good.

103
00:07:25,891 --> 00:07:28,852
Mrs. Giggles must have
straightened you out.

104
00:07:30,437 --> 00:07:32,997
- I certainly did.
- Hello, Francesca.

105
00:07:32,998 --> 00:07:38,919
Yeah, she worked me over pretty good, actually.
Aah. Darling, behave.

106
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,297
What do you know about
a video game called Game Over?

107
00:07:42,298 --> 00:07:46,401
I know that just about every kid in the
world is going to sign on and play it.

108
00:07:46,402 --> 00:07:49,539
Not if we can help it.
The game is a trap.

109
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,606
Once plugged into the game,

110
00:07:51,607 --> 00:07:55,251
parents won't even be able to
get their children's attention.

111
00:07:55,252 --> 00:07:56,810
What else is new?

112
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:58,036
This is different.

113
00:07:58,037 --> 00:08:01,982
Once you get through the game,
your mind belongs to the Toymaker.

114
00:08:01,983 --> 00:08:03,883
The inventor of the game.

115
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:07,086
He wants to enslave
the world's youth with mind control.

116
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:11,591
You control the youth,
you control the future of the world.

117
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:14,618
She's an ingenious hacker, your sister.

118
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,646
We sent her inside to shut down the game.

119
00:08:17,647 --> 00:08:21,034
But... she disappeared.

120
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,861
How can she disappear inside a game?

121
00:08:24,161 --> 00:08:25,870
She didn't physically.

122
00:08:25,871 --> 00:08:28,740
Actually, she's right here in the building.

123
00:08:30,192 --> 00:08:32,543
- Carmen!
- Carmen!

124
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:36,055
She can't hear you.
Her mind's still in the game.

125
00:08:36,056 --> 00:08:39,950
She got as far as level four, then nothing.

126
00:08:39,951 --> 00:08:42,994
Why would she even go in there
without any backup?

127
00:08:42,995 --> 00:08:47,749
Because her first and only choice
wouldn't answer our calls.

128
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,793
So she decided to go alone.

129
00:08:50,794 --> 00:08:54,322
Now, you go in.
Find your sister.

130
00:08:54,323 --> 00:08:57,441
Help her shut down the game in 12 hours,

131
00:08:57,442 --> 00:09:00,253
or it's game over for everyone.

132
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,997
Are you with us?

133
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:05,523
OK.

134
00:09:05,524 --> 00:09:06,725
Then let's go.

135
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:12,480
So I have to shut down the game
but not release the Toymaker?

136
00:09:12,481 --> 00:09:15,608
Exactly.
It would be catastrophic if he escaped.

137
00:09:15,609 --> 00:09:19,653
The Toymaker hates us for imprisoning
him in cyberspace all these years.

138
00:09:19,654 --> 00:09:22,781
- What made you do that?
- Who knows? It was years ago.

139
00:09:22,782 --> 00:09:26,117
Now, you will have to start
on level one like everyone else.

140
00:09:26,118 --> 00:09:30,029
Find your sister on level four.
Then proceed to level five.

141
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,723
- Which is unwinnable.
- Level five is unwinnable?

142
00:09:32,724 --> 00:09:34,792
Level five is where you shut down the game.

143
00:09:34,793 --> 00:09:36,540
If the game is not shut down,

144
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:41,015
you will stay trapped inside with everyone
else when the Toymaker takes over the world.

145
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:45,393
Put on these glasses,

146
00:09:45,394 --> 00:09:47,764
and you will enter the world of the game.

147
00:09:52,017 --> 00:09:55,019
You're being sent into a zero-gravity
chamber alongside Carmen.

148
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,104
That should give you a competitive edge.

149
00:09:57,105 --> 00:10:00,707
When you're in the game, things will
feel real to you. Are they real?

150
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,152
Good luck, Juni.

151
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,994
Find Carmen. Shut down the game.

152
00:10:05,995 --> 00:10:10,184
And whatever you do,
don't let the Toymaker out.

153
00:10:26,515 --> 00:10:27,416
Ugh...

154
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,649
Computer-generated.

155
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:41,746
Low-res!

156
00:10:44,365 --> 00:10:46,609
- Carmen.
- Carmen. Can you hear me?

157
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:49,661
It's Juni. Your brother.

158
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:52,231
Ugh!

159
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:57,194
Pogo Toads!

160
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,603
- Ugh!
- Ugh!

161
00:11:26,403 --> 00:11:27,404
Aah!

162
00:11:28,864 --> 00:11:29,823
Ugh!

163
00:11:48,131 --> 00:11:48,881
Ha!

164
00:11:53,261 --> 00:11:54,220
Ugh!

165
00:11:55,072 --> 00:11:57,923
Hey! Get your own ride, creepo!

166
00:11:57,924 --> 00:12:00,669
Sorry!
I thought you were a toad.

167
00:12:02,904 --> 00:12:05,939
- New player, huh?
- Yeah. New player.

168
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,143
Well, here's a lesson
you won't soon forget.

169
00:12:16,991 --> 00:12:17,991
Aah!

170
00:12:21,162 --> 00:12:22,030
How is he?

171
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,232
His brain waves are normal.

172
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:25,900
But how is he?

173
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,294
- Oh.
- He fell.

174
00:12:43,049 --> 00:12:44,075
Stand up.

175
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:51,914
You fell three stories.
Aah. I survived?

176
00:12:51,915 --> 00:12:55,544
Not exactly.
That is your life count.

177
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:00,314
After taking heavy damage.
You lose a life.

178
00:13:00,315 --> 00:13:02,232
What happens when I hit zero?

179
00:13:02,233 --> 00:13:04,276
Game over.

180
00:13:04,277 --> 00:13:09,598
When you run out of life. You lose.
No replays. No restarts.

181
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,894
What happened to my 12 hours?
I only have four now.

182
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:17,896
Time flies when you're playing games.

183
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,366
This is crazy.

184
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,201
Better hurry.

185
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:34,571
Ugh!

186
00:13:38,641 --> 00:13:40,043
Aah!

187
00:13:44,542 --> 00:13:45,880
So who are you?

188
00:13:45,881 --> 00:13:49,547
I am Juni Cortez,
ex-secret agent of the OSS.

189
00:13:49,548 --> 00:13:51,803
I need to get to level five.

190
00:13:51,804 --> 00:13:55,890
But I only have a few hours before
the Toymaker takes over the world.

191
00:13:55,891 --> 00:13:59,284
- Level five?
- Level five is unwinnable.

192
00:13:59,285 --> 00:14:01,346
I understand that.
But I have to save the world.

193
00:14:01,347 --> 00:14:05,241
Hey, Rez, this person thinks
he's level-five material.

194
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,233
So I hear.

195
00:14:07,234 --> 00:14:11,754
You guys must be beta testers.

196
00:14:11,755 --> 00:14:16,100
One of the first allowed to roam free
these coveted digital hills, my friend.

197
00:14:16,101 --> 00:14:18,760
How can I offer service?

198
00:14:18,761 --> 00:14:20,572
I am Rez.

199
00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:25,917
Hi, Rez.
Now, about saving the world.

200
00:14:25,918 --> 00:14:28,786
If anyone's going to get
to the great prize at level five,

201
00:14:28,787 --> 00:14:30,021
it's going to be one of us.

202
00:14:30,022 --> 00:14:35,676
Whatever. I want cheat codes.
Back-door entrances. Shortcuts. Anything.

203
00:14:35,677 --> 00:14:38,863
I can pay you with bonus packs.

204
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,199
Implementation of any form
of hack code or cheat boost

205
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,950
will trigger an immediate game over

206
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:45,910
and permanent evac from the game.

207
00:14:45,911 --> 00:14:47,462
It's in your tech manual.

208
00:14:47,463 --> 00:14:49,657
You have to play the game by the rules

209
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:52,383
or not at all.

210
00:14:52,384 --> 00:14:53,359
All right.

211
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,754
How do I get to level two
as quickly as possible?

212
00:14:56,755 --> 00:14:59,281
Lives are at stake. Please.

213
00:14:59,282 --> 00:15:02,300
See that target? Hit it.

214
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:03,910
You will bounce straight to the moon.

215
00:15:03,911 --> 00:15:06,763
Yeah. I'd suggest a running start.

216
00:15:06,764 --> 00:15:09,057
Level two is on the dark side
of the moon.

217
00:15:09,058 --> 00:15:12,935
The way to get there is by hitting
that target and bouncing to it.

218
00:15:12,936 --> 00:15:17,265
Not a lot of realism
in these games, is there?

219
00:15:21,836 --> 00:15:25,248
Won't be seeing him anymore.
Let's go.

220
00:15:25,548 --> 00:15:27,215
Less competition, the better.

221
00:15:28,058 --> 00:15:28,651
Aah!

222
00:15:29,051 --> 00:15:31,519
- Aah!
- Ugh!

223
00:15:33,805 --> 00:15:35,173
Wow!

224
00:15:37,133 --> 00:15:38,533
Aah......

225
00:15:55,992 --> 00:15:58,394
Oh, great.

226
00:16:02,315 --> 00:16:06,635
A message from the OSS.
Do you accept?

227
00:16:07,494 --> 00:16:09,121
Mm-hm.

228
00:16:10,789 --> 00:16:13,657
OK, Juni, we can no longer be
of assistance.

229
00:16:13,658 --> 00:16:15,125
What assistance?

230
00:16:15,126 --> 00:16:17,210
You do get one additional lifeline,

231
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:20,347
which you can choose to use now
or later. Now! Give it to me now.

232
00:16:20,348 --> 00:16:23,475
You get to bring in
any one person from the outside

233
00:16:23,476 --> 00:16:24,876
to help you on your journey.

234
00:16:24,877 --> 00:16:26,887
Call up the family files.

235
00:16:27,213 --> 00:16:29,130
Assertive. Athletic.
Knows karate.

236
00:16:29,131 --> 00:16:30,173
Intelligent.

237
00:16:30,174 --> 00:16:31,549
Strategic.

238
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,675
Knows karate.

239
00:16:32,676 --> 00:16:35,678
Wait a minute.
Go back to Grandpa.

240
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:38,097
Pros. Superior intellect.

241
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:40,445
Cons. Physically disabled.

242
00:16:40,446 --> 00:16:43,560
He's been paralyzed
from the waist down for 30 years.

243
00:16:43,561 --> 00:16:45,854
His energy force would have
doubled back again,

244
00:16:45,855 --> 00:16:50,399
making his arms, his heart, his brain
twice as strong as a normal person.

245
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,539
- What are you thinking. Sir?
- I choose Grandpa.

246
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,514
Selected. One moment.

247
00:17:01,978 --> 00:17:04,538
- That was fast.
- Sort of.

248
00:17:05,547 --> 00:17:06,582
Grandpa!

249
00:17:06,882 --> 00:17:07,900
Juni!

250
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,834
Where am I?

251
00:17:09,835 --> 00:17:13,988
In a video game run by a madman
called the Toymaker.

252
00:17:13,989 --> 00:17:16,340
The Toymaker is here?

253
00:17:16,341 --> 00:17:17,934
You know him?

254
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,780
I have been hunting him down
for 30 years, Juni.

255
00:17:24,148 --> 00:17:26,916
- You shouldn't have brought me here.
- I needed your help.

256
00:17:26,917 --> 00:17:30,321
We have to find Carmen
and shut down the game.

257
00:17:31,613 --> 00:17:33,281
What is that?

258
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,285
It's a power-up of some kind.

259
00:17:38,745 --> 00:17:40,246
Mega Legs.

260
00:17:41,247 --> 00:17:43,207
Give it to me.

261
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,760
Grandpa?

262
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,766
You can walk.

263
00:18:02,767 --> 00:18:05,519
No, Juni.

264
00:18:13,568 --> 00:18:16,613
Oh, I can do more than that.

265
00:18:17,447 --> 00:18:18,823
Wow.

266
00:18:26,455 --> 00:18:27,548
Hmm.

267
00:18:28,248 --> 00:18:30,000
Grandpa?

268
00:18:31,293 --> 00:18:32,244
Hmm.

269
00:18:36,214 --> 00:18:37,831
Where are you going?

270
00:18:37,832 --> 00:18:41,668
Don't wait for me, Juni.
I will catch up with you.

271
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:43,762
But we have to find...

272
00:18:44,763 --> 00:18:46,390
Carmen.

273
00:18:50,327 --> 00:18:53,271
Valentin, my old friend.

274
00:18:54,564 --> 00:18:58,025
You think you will catch me
this time, don't you?

275
00:18:58,026 --> 00:19:00,069
Well...

276
00:19:01,862 --> 00:19:03,964
you will.

277
00:19:03,965 --> 00:19:07,260
Oh, you will.

278
00:19:13,657 --> 00:19:16,818
Everything falls into place.

279
00:19:18,495 --> 00:19:21,631
Everything falls.

280
00:19:56,454 --> 00:19:57,454
Wow.

281
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:02,784
A courageous new contestant.
Welcome to the Robocon.

282
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,035
I need to get to level two.

283
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,895
Well, you came to the wrong place.

284
00:20:05,896 --> 00:20:07,805
This is the Arena of Misfortune.

285
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:11,175
You want to get to level two, you're going
to have to battle a Mech. How do I do that?

286
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:13,904
I will explain it to you
when you get up there.

287
00:20:20,885 --> 00:20:22,044
Hey, there.

288
00:20:22,045 --> 00:20:26,624
Just go out there
in your Battle Mech and fight.

289
00:20:34,322 --> 00:20:36,658
Wait a minute.
Who am I fighting?

290
00:20:37,158 --> 00:20:37,968
Her.

291
00:20:45,249 --> 00:20:48,294
Don't get too trashed
and I win bonus points.

292
00:21:02,965 --> 00:21:04,866
Right foot, left foot.

293
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:06,944
Right foot. Oh!

294
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,106
Oh! How do you work this thing?

295
00:21:21,249 --> 00:21:22,241
Ooh....

296
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:26,171
Ooh.

297
00:21:26,971 --> 00:21:29,405
OK. I want a good clean robo fight.

298
00:21:29,406 --> 00:21:33,784
There will be no kidney punches.
No rabbit punches.

299
00:21:33,785 --> 00:21:36,020
No eye gouging or ear biting.

300
00:21:36,021 --> 00:21:39,882
Unless. Of course.
You can't help yourself.

301
00:21:41,084 --> 00:21:41,734
Hi.

302
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,763
I am Juni.

303
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,215
Oh, I am sorry.

304
00:21:49,216 --> 00:21:52,477
I am sorry. He didn't mean it.
Really, really.

305
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,771
No. No, no, no!

306
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,140
Please, no!

307
00:22:00,818 --> 00:22:02,177
Oh.....

308
00:22:22,705 --> 00:22:25,258
Hi. I am Demetra.

309
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:16,845
Aah....

310
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:26,589
Help.

311
00:23:47,283 --> 00:23:50,627
- Oh!
- That's got to hurt.

312
00:24:56,905 --> 00:24:58,557
I am the winner!

313
00:24:58,857 --> 00:24:59,766
Yeah!

314
00:25:00,066 --> 00:25:02,067
Whoo! Yes!

315
00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:04,211
Well, well, well.

316
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:07,155
For a kid that doesn't know how to fight,

317
00:25:07,156 --> 00:25:09,649
you sure know how to fight.

318
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:13,578
Congratulations.
And keep the suit.

319
00:25:14,863 --> 00:25:18,165
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

320
00:25:21,836 --> 00:25:26,856
So, let's go over this again, shall we? So
there's no mistake. So there's no gross error.

321
00:25:26,857 --> 00:25:30,276
So there's no lack
of communication amongst us.

322
00:25:30,277 --> 00:25:33,679
What I want, what we want...

323
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,381
What do we want?

324
00:25:35,382 --> 00:25:39,860
Our time on this planet is over.
It belongs now to our youth.

325
00:25:39,861 --> 00:25:42,429
Not if we control their minds!

326
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:46,357
We could start the world over again
and cure it of its diseases.

327
00:25:46,358 --> 00:25:49,111
We could begin anew.

328
00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:58,762
Forget what we could do!
It's what we should do!

329
00:25:59,162 --> 00:26:03,165
Am I doing the right thing?

330
00:26:03,407 --> 00:26:08,252
It's not about the right thing.
It's about the smart thing. Ah.

331
00:26:08,253 --> 00:26:10,830
We won't escape this place otherwise.

332
00:26:10,831 --> 00:26:14,834
I speak for all of us
when I say, "We want out!"

333
00:26:14,835 --> 00:26:19,005
Hmm. The end justifies the means.

334
00:26:19,405 --> 00:26:24,435
You have the children's attention. The
question is, what are you teaching them?

335
00:26:25,311 --> 00:26:27,187
Who are you people?

336
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,856
We are you.

337
00:26:31,066 --> 00:26:32,642
Forgive me. Forgive me.

338
00:26:32,643 --> 00:26:35,861
I forget the extent of my
programming powers from time to time.

339
00:26:35,862 --> 00:26:42,034
And for a moment, I actually
believed that you existed.

340
00:26:44,578 --> 00:26:45,996
Goodbye.

341
00:26:47,031 --> 00:26:50,125
Out, out, out.
Out, out.

342
00:26:51,668 --> 00:26:59,000
This childish game will soon be over.
And then the real game will begin.

343
00:27:01,294 --> 00:27:02,621
Hmm.

344
00:27:19,944 --> 00:27:21,543
Will you look at this?

345
00:27:24,382 --> 00:27:28,778
Hold on to your joysticks, boys.
I think we got him.

346
00:27:32,747 --> 00:27:35,007
- You're the Guy.
- I am the who?

347
00:27:35,008 --> 00:27:37,919
The Guy.
The guy from the poster.

348
00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:40,129
That guy.

349
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:43,807
No. Wait a minute.

350
00:27:43,808 --> 00:27:47,710
I am only looking for my sister.
She's somewhere on level four.

351
00:27:47,711 --> 00:27:50,664
Then I am heading out through level five.

352
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:56,051
So you can win the game?
I guess that's one way of putting it.

353
00:27:56,052 --> 00:27:59,381
You see, according to the tech manual,

354
00:27:59,681 --> 00:28:02,217
if we find the Guy...

355
00:28:02,817 --> 00:28:06,703
the Guy, he will lead us
through the unwinnable level.

356
00:28:06,704 --> 00:28:10,581
Hey, just because he made it out of Robocon
in one piece doesn't mean he's the Guy.

357
00:28:10,582 --> 00:28:13,252
He's the first I have seen
to make it out with the power suit.

358
00:28:13,552 --> 00:28:17,147
Man, give me a break.
This wimp's a phony.

359
00:28:18,831 --> 00:28:20,642
There's only one way to find out.

360
00:28:22,168 --> 00:28:23,620
Mega Race.

361
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,730
The fastest, most dangerous race
in the game world.

362
00:28:27,731 --> 00:28:31,034
- Come on. No. Wait.
- I already told you I am not the Guy.

363
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:32,552
- Go.
- OK.

364
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,789
The race will begin shortly.

365
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,868
Claim your vehicle.

366
00:28:49,092 --> 00:28:52,628
You got to be kidding.
This race will tell us if you're the Guy.

367
00:28:52,629 --> 00:28:58,793
If you are, you can hang with us. But if
you're a phony, Arnold will crush you.

368
00:28:59,193 --> 00:29:00,693
Aah....

369
00:29:01,979 --> 00:29:06,033
I am not the Guy.
How many times do I have to say it?

370
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:11,555
There are no rules in this race
except win at any cost.

371
00:29:13,473 --> 00:29:14,543
All right.

372
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:46,662
We will try to help you out...
as much as we can.

373
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:51,366
The race will begin... now.
One. Two. Three. Go!

374
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:09,424
Hmm...?

375
00:30:17,323 --> 00:30:20,751
- Easy as pie.
- Juni, push the red button.

376
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:23,828
The one that says "Do not push"?

377
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:26,306
Yeah. Push it.
It's a turbo boost.

378
00:30:26,307 --> 00:30:28,159
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

379
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:41,428
Aah....

380
00:30:42,246 --> 00:30:44,647
Hey, Rez, give me a hand!

381
00:30:44,648 --> 00:30:47,718
Hey, how about a foot?
Aah! Aah!

382
00:30:49,136 --> 00:30:50,279
Whoa!

383
00:30:58,269 --> 00:30:59,529
Whoa!

384
00:31:02,273 --> 00:31:03,933
My turn, sucker.

385
00:31:09,705 --> 00:31:12,740
You're supposed to be
winning the race, Juni.

386
00:31:12,741 --> 00:31:14,034
Grandpa!

387
00:31:39,891 --> 00:31:41,768
What is this?

388
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:51,451
Whoa!

389
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,671
Ugh!

390
00:32:14,672 --> 00:32:15,798
Ugh!

391
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:17,500
Nngh!

392
00:32:18,843 --> 00:32:19,593
Oh!

393
00:32:20,344 --> 00:32:21,761
The glove!

394
00:32:21,762 --> 00:32:23,721
Grab the glove.

395
00:32:23,722 --> 00:32:25,724
The glove!

396
00:32:26,725 --> 00:32:27,893
Ugh!

397
00:32:32,063 --> 00:32:33,440
Whoa!

398
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,108
Whoa!

399
00:32:40,905 --> 00:32:41,864
Whoa!

400
00:33:10,991 --> 00:33:12,326
Ugh!

401
00:33:27,197 --> 00:33:28,349
Whoa.

402
00:33:34,404 --> 00:33:35,424
Uh-oh.

403
00:33:48,934 --> 00:33:52,721
Aah!
Grab another bike, Juni!

404
00:34:00,394 --> 00:34:02,005
Final stretch!

405
00:34:32,224 --> 00:34:33,991
Five... four...

406
00:34:33,992 --> 00:34:36,793
three... two... one.

407
00:34:36,794 --> 00:34:42,175
Winner by a hubcap.
Juni.... Cortez!

408
00:34:56,696 --> 00:34:59,699
- I thought you were him.
- I knew it.

409
00:35:02,034 --> 00:35:04,036
I guess you are.

410
00:35:12,252 --> 00:35:15,796
So, I hear you're the Guy.

411
00:35:15,797 --> 00:35:20,009
I am definitely the Guy. Yeah!

412
00:35:21,541 --> 00:35:24,555
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

413
00:35:38,067 --> 00:35:43,897
So now what, Guy? I have to go
talk to my grandfather. To who?

414
00:35:43,898 --> 00:35:46,866
I mean I must confer...

415
00:35:46,867 --> 00:35:52,289
with the Wizard of Atari-Sega-Nendo.

416
00:35:53,289 --> 00:35:55,734
Yeah. OK, cool.

417
00:36:01,213 --> 00:36:04,708
Congratulations. You won the race.

418
00:36:04,709 --> 00:36:08,678
But now they think I am some important guy
who's going to win the game for them.

419
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:12,222
For our purposes, that's very good.

420
00:36:12,223 --> 00:36:17,194
They can lead us to level four more
quickly, so you can find your sister,

421
00:36:17,195 --> 00:36:20,297
so we can shut down the game
and make things right.

422
00:36:20,298 --> 00:36:24,227
And so that I can find...

423
00:36:25,027 --> 00:36:27,236
the Toymaker.

424
00:36:27,237 --> 00:36:30,866
We're not supposed to
get near the Toymaker.

425
00:36:31,783 --> 00:36:35,619
So say the rules of the OSS,

426
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,871
which I am not following.

427
00:36:37,872 --> 00:36:43,743
He might escape.
We can't risk that. Oh, no, Juni.

428
00:36:43,744 --> 00:36:48,764
I don't plan on letting him go anywhere.
Guy!

429
00:36:49,841 --> 00:36:51,593
We will talk about this later.

430
00:36:52,802 --> 00:36:54,553
OK. Here it is.

431
00:36:54,554 --> 00:36:57,539
I am not supposed to
lead you to level five.

432
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,566
You're supposed to lead me there.

433
00:36:59,567 --> 00:37:01,851
So you mean we work together?

434
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:06,355
The wizard said if we all work together,
we all win.

435
00:37:06,356 --> 00:37:08,816
With my strength.

436
00:37:08,817 --> 00:37:10,484
My brains.

437
00:37:10,485 --> 00:37:12,611
My cool.

438
00:37:12,612 --> 00:37:15,073
My intuition.

439
00:37:15,823 --> 00:37:19,776
OK. So you're the Guy.
We're all counting on you.

440
00:37:19,777 --> 00:37:23,280
But if you fail us or if you're
not who you say you are,

441
00:37:23,281 --> 00:37:29,051
this life counter will hit zero
faster than you can say "oops." Deal.

442
00:37:29,052 --> 00:37:34,181
First I got to find my sister.
So level four, people.

443
00:37:34,182 --> 00:37:35,884
Move!

444
00:37:44,475 --> 00:37:47,976
Come on, Grandpa.
He's doing good, huh? Huh?

445
00:37:47,977 --> 00:37:52,598
Yeah, he's doing great,
and that's the problem. Why?

446
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:55,902
They have awoken the Programmerz.
What?

447
00:37:56,361 --> 00:37:59,622
- Pull him out of there now.
- Too late.

448
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:05,543
All right. This is cool.

449
00:38:05,544 --> 00:38:07,913
We will get there in no time.

450
00:38:08,705 --> 00:38:10,274
What is this?

451
00:38:14,794 --> 00:38:16,296
Wait a minute.

452
00:38:18,414 --> 00:38:19,774
The Programmerz.

453
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:24,394
Who are these Programmerz?

454
00:38:24,395 --> 00:38:26,604
The brainiacs who wrote
the book for the game.

455
00:38:26,605 --> 00:38:33,719
So, they work for the Toymaker, huh? Programmerz
are the reason that you found us on level one.

456
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,221
They caught Francis cheating
during the Mega Race.

457
00:38:36,222 --> 00:38:39,016
They will bounce us back
to level one again if they catch us.

458
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:41,994
Level one? I don't have time for that.

459
00:38:44,029 --> 00:38:45,079
Spread out.

460
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,190
Don't split up! It never works!

461
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:49,701
If we just stick together...

462
00:38:50,144 --> 00:38:54,648
All right, Grandpa.
I guess it's just you and me.

463
00:38:55,248 --> 00:38:57,000
Hello?

464
00:38:58,167 --> 00:38:59,578
Grandpa?

465
00:39:08,168 --> 00:39:09,311
- Psst!
- Aah...

466
00:39:09,811 --> 00:39:12,722
Can you at least try and act
like you're the Guy?

467
00:39:12,723 --> 00:39:14,865
You know my secret?

468
00:39:14,866 --> 00:39:18,286
I have seen the real Guy,
and you're not him.

469
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,055
Why are Programmerz chasing us?

470
00:39:22,056 --> 00:39:23,807
Someone's got a game cheat.

471
00:39:23,808 --> 00:39:25,274
What's this?

472
00:39:25,275 --> 00:39:26,559
A map to the game.

473
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,227
This is illegal.

474
00:39:28,228 --> 00:39:30,839
You want to find your sister or not?

475
00:39:32,282 --> 00:39:33,584
Give me the map.

476
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:37,152
- OK.
- Wow.

477
00:39:37,153 --> 00:39:38,612
We're in Machine City.

478
00:39:38,613 --> 00:39:44,226
If we cut across here, we will be able to
reach level four. Where Carmen is. Right.

479
00:39:44,227 --> 00:39:47,087
Then, if we cut through Lava Mountain,

480
00:39:47,088 --> 00:39:49,831
we will be right at the door
of the unwinnable level.

481
00:39:49,832 --> 00:39:53,834
Shortcuts. This is good.
This is very good.

482
00:39:53,835 --> 00:39:56,221
Game cheats.

483
00:39:57,542 --> 00:39:59,924
That's against the rules.

484
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:06,339
We're going to have to bounce you
back to level one.

485
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:09,307
- Aah...
- You can't scare us. He's the Guy.

486
00:40:09,308 --> 00:40:10,501
Grandpa!

487
00:40:11,001 --> 00:40:16,664
Listen to that, Edog.
The Guy is calling his grandpa.

488
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:20,292
I am so scared.
Come and get me, Gramps.

489
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:23,245
What's he going to do, drool on us?

490
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:27,124
Why are you picking on my grandson?

491
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:29,251
Why?

492
00:40:30,502 --> 00:40:33,222
They got Logos and Edog, the leaders.

493
00:40:33,622 --> 00:40:35,856
You are Programmerz?

494
00:40:35,857 --> 00:40:39,085
Let's see what you really look like, huh?

495
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:45,474
Very unimpressive.

496
00:40:46,016 --> 00:40:51,178
Computer nerds.
Now tell me, where is the Toymaker?

497
00:40:51,179 --> 00:40:55,275
Grandpa... uh, Wizard, put them down!

498
00:41:09,254 --> 00:41:11,121
He is good.

499
00:41:11,122 --> 00:41:14,208
The boy warrior is very, very good.

500
00:41:14,209 --> 00:41:15,834
But he's got to keep going.

501
00:41:15,835 --> 00:41:20,544
We run the risk of discouraging him
if the next levels are too challenging.

502
00:41:20,545 --> 00:41:25,643
But only by seeking challenges can we
hope to find the best in ourselves.

503
00:41:25,644 --> 00:41:29,147
Can we help him?
No! It's against the rules of the game!

504
00:41:29,148 --> 00:41:31,600
This isn't a game.

505
00:41:32,309 --> 00:41:33,886
It's life!

506
00:41:36,396 --> 00:41:38,198
I don't mind talking to myself.

507
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:42,367
But when you guys start to
cut me out of the conversation,

508
00:41:42,368 --> 00:41:46,029
that's when it gets a little strange.

509
00:41:47,106 --> 00:41:50,266
That's it.
More life is what we need.

510
00:41:50,267 --> 00:41:54,288
We will grant the boy a gift.
The gift of life.

511
00:42:02,169 --> 00:42:05,214
Don't worry, Guy.
From here on out, I will protect you.

512
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:08,307
Are you all right, Guy?

513
00:42:08,308 --> 00:42:11,277
Hey. He found a life pack.

514
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,645
A what?

515
00:42:12,646 --> 00:42:13,879
That's rare.

516
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,056
I have never seen one up close before.

517
00:42:16,057 --> 00:42:17,758
What do I do?

518
00:42:17,759 --> 00:42:21,812
Crush it in your hands.
You will gain life.

519
00:42:23,397 --> 00:42:24,332
How much?

520
00:42:24,732 --> 00:42:26,175
All depends.

521
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,104
I got extra life, Demetra.

522
00:42:32,105 --> 00:42:35,742
Congratulations.
You will need it the most.

523
00:42:36,576 --> 00:42:38,803
I want you to take it.

524
00:42:39,495 --> 00:42:41,097
Juni, I can't.

525
00:42:50,055 --> 00:42:53,442
Does he know what that's worth?
Of course he does.

526
00:42:55,535 --> 00:42:58,140
I owed you from the Robot Arena.

527
00:42:58,141 --> 00:43:02,857
Also, I don't want anything
to happen to you.

528
00:43:02,858 --> 00:43:04,343
Thank you.

529
00:43:08,906 --> 00:43:12,926
You have now entered level three.

530
00:43:19,949 --> 00:43:23,677
I wish my family
could see this amazing place.

531
00:43:23,678 --> 00:43:26,955
What are you doing in the game, Arnold?

532
00:43:37,891 --> 00:43:40,800
Well, actually, I got in
on a beta tester's visa.

533
00:43:40,801 --> 00:43:43,543
I am here for the great prize
behind level five.

534
00:43:43,544 --> 00:43:47,774
It will save my family from poverty.
But what waits for us in level five?

535
00:43:47,775 --> 00:43:51,161
I mean, is it all true?
Untold riches?

536
00:43:51,645 --> 00:43:56,198
Arnold, you should know
that when we reach the end of the game...

537
00:43:56,199 --> 00:43:59,243
No. Don't tell me.

538
00:43:59,902 --> 00:44:02,320
I want it to be a surprise.

539
00:44:02,321 --> 00:44:03,533
I am sure it will be.

540
00:44:03,534 --> 00:44:08,127
Attention. Gamers!
Stand on the red line.

541
00:44:09,695 --> 00:44:12,898
Choose your best player.

542
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:16,084
The Guy.
The Guy's the best.

543
00:44:17,335 --> 00:44:21,798
Choose your strongest player.
That'd be Arnold.

544
00:44:35,385 --> 00:44:37,911
Survival of the fittest.

545
00:44:37,912 --> 00:44:40,356
Face your opponent.

546
00:44:42,967 --> 00:44:45,827
Wait a minute.
I am not fighting Arnold.

547
00:44:45,828 --> 00:44:47,562
I don't want to crush Juni.

548
00:44:47,563 --> 00:44:50,690
The winner shall proceed
with the others to level four.

549
00:44:50,691 --> 00:44:53,392
The loser shall be given
an immediate game over

550
00:44:53,393 --> 00:44:57,854
and will be evacuated
permanently from the game.

551
00:44:57,855 --> 00:45:02,235
Arnold, I have to save my sister.
I am sorry, Juni.

552
00:45:02,535 --> 00:45:05,171
But I have my own family to think about.

553
00:45:06,472 --> 00:45:08,199
I can't beat you, Arnold.

554
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:16,890
- I know.
- Fight!

555
00:45:32,153 --> 00:45:33,822
Aah....

556
00:45:59,295 --> 00:46:04,375
Not that I am rooting for anyone in
particular, but that was a really cool move.

557
00:46:07,778 --> 00:46:09,534
Aah.....

558
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:28,288
Nice knowing you, Juni.
Arnold, please!

559
00:46:28,947 --> 00:46:30,366
Unh....

560
00:46:35,553 --> 00:46:37,195
What's going on?

561
00:46:37,196 --> 00:46:38,930
You have been tagged.

562
00:46:38,931 --> 00:46:40,991
What do you mean, I have been tagged?

563
00:46:40,992 --> 00:46:43,819
Someone has switched places with you.

564
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:48,015
Not me, Guy.

565
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:54,288
Demetra, what are you doing?
You have to find your sister, Juni.

566
00:46:55,289 --> 00:46:57,765
Demet....
Don't! Don't do it!

567
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:03,237
- Demetra, no!
- Fight!

568
00:47:05,915 --> 00:47:08,200
- No...
- Aah...

569
00:47:11,536 --> 00:47:15,207
- Demetra.
- Game over!

570
00:47:20,553 --> 00:47:24,866
I never even got her e-mail address.

571
00:47:28,885 --> 00:47:32,714
Don't fall in love with a game, Juni.

572
00:47:37,185 --> 00:47:38,770
Let's get out of here.

573
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:41,689
Sorry, Juni.

574
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:44,333
My family.

575
00:47:50,822 --> 00:47:55,260
You are causing so much pain.

576
00:47:56,744 --> 00:47:59,330
And only I can stop you.

577
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:03,217
For I know why you do these things...

578
00:48:04,126 --> 00:48:05,862
Toymaker.

579
00:48:07,421 --> 00:48:09,423
Bring it on.

580
00:48:10,423 --> 00:48:14,611
Find me, and the world
will truly pay the price.

581
00:48:15,895 --> 00:48:20,766
Here in my cyberprison
I was forced to create.

582
00:48:22,226 --> 00:48:25,329
Now I will destroy.

583
00:48:27,439 --> 00:48:30,609
Release the girl.
Put her back in the game.

584
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:34,954
But, sir...
Oh, you have a better solution, don't you?

585
00:48:34,955 --> 00:48:39,866
Of course you do. You all do. So tell me.
What is the real answer? Please.

586
00:48:39,867 --> 00:48:44,212
- I am so curious.
- Revenge. Healing. Destruction!

587
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:45,713
- Love.
- Hate.

588
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:49,367
Uh-huh.
Well, once again, you're all correct.

589
00:48:49,368 --> 00:48:52,696
And once again, you're all incorrect.

590
00:48:59,711 --> 00:49:01,730
On with the game.

591
00:49:05,866 --> 00:49:10,303
You are now entering level four.

592
00:49:10,304 --> 00:49:15,692
Level four? Wait a minute.
Carmen's on this level.

593
00:49:25,059 --> 00:49:26,109
I will use telepathy.

594
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:30,788
We might be close enough that it will work.
Carmen. Can you hear me?

595
00:49:30,789 --> 00:49:32,748
What?

596
00:49:32,749 --> 00:49:34,792
This game plays tricks.

597
00:49:34,793 --> 00:49:37,627
Tell me something only Carmen would say.

598
00:49:37,628 --> 00:49:40,131
My feet stink.

599
00:49:41,132 --> 00:49:42,632
You sound close.

600
00:49:42,633 --> 00:49:44,177
I am.

601
00:49:59,098 --> 00:50:01,943
I see you brought Grandpa into the game.

602
00:50:02,443 --> 00:50:06,238
I thought it was a good idea at the time.
Juni!

603
00:50:06,738 --> 00:50:09,899
The Toymaker's the guy
who put Grandpa in the wheelchair

604
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:12,001
30 years ago.

605
00:50:12,002 --> 00:50:13,652
Exactly.

606
00:50:13,653 --> 00:50:17,631
If Grandpa tries to take revenge,
the Toymaker will break free.

607
00:50:17,632 --> 00:50:19,667
He's that powerful.

608
00:50:20,368 --> 00:50:24,420
Well, then we have to try to convince Grandpa
that revenge is not the way to solve it.

609
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:26,364
OK, Guy. We found your pal.

610
00:50:26,365 --> 00:50:29,283
Now, where are we going, exactly?
Where's level five?

611
00:50:29,284 --> 00:50:31,786
First of all, you don't
ask the questions around here.

612
00:50:31,787 --> 00:50:36,815
I do. Second of all....
We're going to Lava Mountain. We are?

613
00:50:36,816 --> 00:50:40,260
Beyond that is the passage to level five.

614
00:50:40,261 --> 00:50:44,105
I don't think so.
Oh, so suddenly you're the game expert.

615
00:50:44,106 --> 00:50:46,358
We're following the Guy.

616
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:52,997
You know, Juni, we don't need these guys
following us. Not where we're going.

617
00:50:52,998 --> 00:50:55,265
I promised them they could tag along.

618
00:50:55,266 --> 00:50:59,370
Look, this is how I know where to go.
Trust me.

619
00:51:02,289 --> 00:51:07,501
Lava Mountain. Why is it that every
video game has lava in it?

620
00:51:07,502 --> 00:51:10,838
Technically, that's not true.
There's no lava in Halo.

621
00:51:10,839 --> 00:51:15,860
And in Metroid, it's molten magma.
Can't touch the lava, or it's game over.

622
00:51:15,861 --> 00:51:20,113
But I have six lives left.
Doesn't matter. You fall in, you lose.

623
00:51:20,114 --> 00:51:22,658
The game's getting tougher, guys.

624
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:24,559
This is impossible.

625
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:27,603
What do you think, Grandpa?

626
00:51:27,604 --> 00:51:29,063
Difficult.

627
00:51:29,064 --> 00:51:32,692
Let's go another way.
Follow me, boys.

628
00:51:33,985 --> 00:51:35,929
This doesn't make any sense.

629
00:51:36,329 --> 00:51:38,613
I give them a map.

630
00:51:38,614 --> 00:51:40,699
I give them the girl.

631
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,867
What more do they want?

632
00:51:42,868 --> 00:51:44,952
Can't I just lead them to the door?

633
00:51:44,953 --> 00:51:48,756
Impossible, sir. The way the game's
A.I. works is... I know. I know.

634
00:51:48,757 --> 00:51:50,875
Can I just talk to myself at least?

635
00:51:50,876 --> 00:51:57,589
You are talking to yourself.
I am you. Well, then, you, me, shut up.

636
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:00,383
So be it.
Am I insane?

637
00:52:00,384 --> 00:52:01,936
Completely.

638
00:52:06,849 --> 00:52:09,268
They're going the wrong way.

639
00:52:09,548 --> 00:52:12,812
I have to drive them to level five.

640
00:52:16,474 --> 00:52:20,269
Send in the Tinker Toys.

641
00:52:22,346 --> 00:52:25,098
Finding another path.
Now, this is good thinking.

642
00:52:25,099 --> 00:52:27,417
She's good, Guy.
We should listen to her more often.

643
00:52:27,418 --> 00:52:31,536
- Stay off my side.
- OK.

644
00:52:37,135 --> 00:52:38,428
What is this?

645
00:52:49,971 --> 00:52:51,790
Tinker Toys!

646
00:52:55,518 --> 00:52:58,838
Wait!
What's worse, lava or Tinker Toys?

647
00:52:59,138 --> 00:53:01,491
Definitely Tinker Toys.

648
00:53:01,991 --> 00:53:03,976
Carmen, what do we do?

649
00:53:39,976 --> 00:53:41,226
Whoa...

650
00:53:43,812 --> 00:53:45,280
Ugh....

651
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:49,484
Uh-oh!

652
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,203
Whoo-hoo!

653
00:53:52,204 --> 00:53:55,257
Rip that wave, Juni.

654
00:53:56,866 --> 00:53:58,545
What are they doing?

655
00:53:58,546 --> 00:54:00,794
They're straying from the path.

656
00:54:00,795 --> 00:54:03,221
The Toymaker must be
pushing them towards his lair.

657
00:54:03,222 --> 00:54:06,708
But why? What could he gain from...

658
00:54:07,217 --> 00:54:12,348
Check if there's a connection between the
grandfather and the Toymaker. Hurry, people!

659
00:54:12,848 --> 00:54:15,092
It's coming on-screen.

660
00:54:15,392 --> 00:54:17,844
Comrades turned enemies.

661
00:54:19,011 --> 00:54:22,222
Grandpa's going to break the Toymaker
out of the game to get his revenge.

662
00:54:22,223 --> 00:54:23,765
Stop them.

663
00:54:23,766 --> 00:54:28,185
Stir the lava. Bigger waves.
Lava monsters. Anything.

664
00:54:28,186 --> 00:54:30,988
We have to create obstacles for them.
Come on!

665
00:54:30,989 --> 00:54:32,724
We have to drown them.

666
00:54:34,067 --> 00:54:37,444
They will get immediate game over
and be evacuated from the game.

667
00:54:37,445 --> 00:54:40,614
We can't risk letting the Toymaker out.

668
00:54:42,658 --> 00:54:43,701
Do it.

669
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:52,952
This is new.

670
00:54:57,755 --> 00:54:59,257
Juni!

671
00:55:03,385 --> 00:55:04,762
Carmen!

672
00:55:07,806 --> 00:55:09,058
Francis!

673
00:55:10,725 --> 00:55:12,235
Arnold!

674
00:55:16,022 --> 00:55:17,524
Grandpa!

675
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:20,691
Me.

676
00:55:21,944 --> 00:55:23,070
Aah!

677
00:55:24,196 --> 00:55:25,289
Where are they?

678
00:55:25,549 --> 00:55:30,459
They fell in. I know,
but they should have gotten a game over.

679
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:34,164
They should be back here, actually.
Hmm.

680
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:40,670
Huh?

681
00:55:42,421 --> 00:55:45,800
The lava. It's cold.

682
00:55:47,267 --> 00:55:53,174
This way. Juni. This way.
We found a door to the next level. Come on.

683
00:55:56,384 --> 00:55:58,620
I thought I was a goner.

684
00:55:59,813 --> 00:56:02,773
I saw all my points
flashing away before my eyes.

685
00:56:02,774 --> 00:56:06,632
All I could hear was
my father saying, "You blew it, Arnold."

686
00:56:06,633 --> 00:56:09,196
"No untold riches for you."

687
00:56:10,197 --> 00:56:11,948
Uhh!

688
00:56:14,617 --> 00:56:17,736
Where's Grandpa?
I don't know. But he was here.

689
00:56:17,737 --> 00:56:19,898
Isn't this a piece of his armor?

690
00:56:24,118 --> 00:56:27,612
Carmen, it's a passage.
Help me open it.

691
00:56:27,613 --> 00:56:29,130
Red flag, Rez.

692
00:56:29,131 --> 00:56:34,343
We have to talk about the Guy.
Highly sensitive. What about him?

693
00:56:34,344 --> 00:56:39,047
I have been re-reading my tech manual.
It speaks of a deceiver within the game,

694
00:56:39,048 --> 00:56:42,092
someone who will mislead you down a path
where no one will survive.

695
00:56:42,093 --> 00:56:44,853
I think Juni's the deceiver.

696
00:56:45,729 --> 00:56:47,780
What do you suggest?

697
00:56:47,781 --> 00:56:52,310
We will have to get rid of him
or risk losing the game.

698
00:56:53,528 --> 00:56:56,823
What about his sister?
Her too.

699
00:57:01,546 --> 00:57:05,797
- How much time do we have left?
- Five minutes. What happens in 5 minutes?

700
00:57:05,798 --> 00:57:10,701
This place gets flooded with players from
around the world. Oh, great. Competition.

701
00:57:10,702 --> 00:57:14,585
The Toymaker will take over their minds.
That's why we have to shut down the game.

702
00:57:14,586 --> 00:57:18,225
- Sh, Carmen!
- What is she talking about?

703
00:57:18,851 --> 00:57:20,852
You didn't tell them yet, did you?

704
00:57:20,853 --> 00:57:24,542
I was getting around to it.
Deceivers.

705
00:57:24,543 --> 00:57:26,733
What about the other side of level five?

706
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:30,011
There is no other side.
You will be imprisoned in the game.

707
00:57:30,012 --> 00:57:33,439
Game over.
We're not letting you shut down this game.

708
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,842
Now, you're going to see how fast
that counter yours can count backwards.

709
00:57:36,843 --> 00:57:43,081
You have to go through me first, game boy.
Now, listen to me. I am the Guy.

710
00:57:43,082 --> 00:57:44,916
Stop saying you're the Guy.

711
00:57:44,917 --> 00:57:47,251
We all know that you're not the Guy.

712
00:57:47,252 --> 00:57:49,371
He's not the Guy.

713
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:55,919
I am.

714
00:57:59,005 --> 00:58:00,506
And you are?

715
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:02,851
I am the Guy.

716
00:58:03,251 --> 00:58:04,902
The real Guy.

717
00:58:05,302 --> 00:58:09,046
And I say we go in, we beat this unwinnable
level, and we get to the other side,

718
00:58:09,047 --> 00:58:13,993
where untold riches and a bounty fit
for 10 kings awaits us. I knew it.

719
00:58:13,994 --> 00:58:17,054
Now, he's definitely the Guy.

720
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,391
But it's unwinnable.

721
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:27,021
Nothing is unwinnable

722
00:58:27,022 --> 00:58:31,651
if we join together and battle as one.
We play on each other's strengths...

723
00:58:31,652 --> 00:58:33,661
and help cover each other's weaknesses.

724
00:58:33,662 --> 00:58:37,916
We can accomplish anything.
And we will accomplish everything.

725
00:58:38,216 --> 00:58:45,062
But first let's go whip this unwinnable
level and show it who's boss.

726
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:47,591
Are you with me?
Yeah!

727
00:58:48,592 --> 00:58:49,969
Stand aside.

728
00:59:04,857 --> 00:59:06,400
Cake.

729
00:59:07,184 --> 00:59:09,878
Aah! Aah!

730
00:59:17,577 --> 00:59:18,785
Oh!

731
00:59:18,786 --> 00:59:19,971
Oh, my.

732
00:59:23,666 --> 00:59:25,042
Oops.

733
00:59:27,377 --> 00:59:28,549
Guy!

734
00:59:29,805 --> 00:59:33,824
OK. You're the Guy again.
Get us through this, Juni.

735
00:59:33,825 --> 00:59:35,468
But, I...

736
00:59:45,602 --> 00:59:46,971
Demetra!

737
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:49,146
Juni, quickly!

738
00:59:49,147 --> 00:59:50,806
I found the switch to shut down the game.

739
00:59:50,807 --> 00:59:52,491
I also found the exit portal.

740
00:59:52,492 --> 00:59:54,693
We can all get out of here right now.

741
00:59:54,694 --> 00:59:56,903
How did you survive?

742
00:59:56,904 --> 00:59:59,489
There was a glitch in the game.
I don't know.

743
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:01,057
Juni, who is this?

744
01:00:01,058 --> 01:00:06,129
This is Demetra, my girlf...
My friend. No, she's my...

745
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:09,248
I am his girlfriend.
Who are you?

746
01:00:09,249 --> 01:00:11,133
I am his sister.

747
01:00:11,134 --> 01:00:14,333
She gave me the map.
The map that got us here.

748
01:00:14,334 --> 01:00:16,147
Juni, she's not real.

749
01:00:17,423 --> 01:00:20,851
What are you talking about?
I have been helping Juni win the game.

750
01:00:20,852 --> 01:00:24,178
What have you been doing?
Playing prisoner. That's what.

751
01:00:24,179 --> 01:00:27,298
She set you up, Juni.
She set us all up.

752
01:00:27,299 --> 01:00:31,727
I... Juni, she's lying.
She's been the Toymaker's prisoner.

753
01:00:31,728 --> 01:00:34,405
She could be brainwashed, for all we know.

754
01:00:34,406 --> 01:00:37,400
Do you want to win this game or not?

755
01:00:42,204 --> 01:00:47,075
She's the reason this level's unwinnable.
She's the deceiver.

756
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,786
Why?
I am sorry, Juni.

757
01:00:50,787 --> 01:00:54,207
But it's in my programming.

758
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:06,602
Congratulations! You have made it
to the end of the game! You won!

759
01:01:07,302 --> 01:01:09,796
Untold riches for all of you!

760
01:01:09,797 --> 01:01:14,976
And your prize is
you get to stay... here.

761
01:01:15,602 --> 01:01:17,729
Welcome to the game.

762
01:01:23,776 --> 01:01:25,368
Juni, this way.

763
01:01:25,369 --> 01:01:26,539
This is the way out.

764
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:28,305
All of you, quickly!

765
01:01:32,709 --> 01:01:34,793
Wait!
We have to shut down the game.

766
01:01:34,794 --> 01:01:37,004
I already did.
The switch is right there.

767
01:01:37,005 --> 01:01:40,717
- Are you sure? Yes, yes.
- Go. Quickly, quickly.

768
01:01:49,466 --> 01:01:53,070
Run, Grandpa!
Go. I will hold it open.

769
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:54,796
Go now!

770
01:01:55,638 --> 01:02:00,226
Demetra.
I can't hold it open forever, Juni.

771
01:02:06,565 --> 01:02:07,899
We made it.

772
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:14,281
Here's our e-mail addresses.
Just in case. Terrific.

773
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:20,153
You're awesome, Grandpa.
The way you took on those Tinker Toys.

774
01:02:21,579 --> 01:02:23,197
You're the coolest.

775
01:02:26,667 --> 01:02:29,010
Thanks for everything, Guy.

776
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:32,297
It was real. Sort of.

777
01:02:33,339 --> 01:02:35,200
Thanks a lot, Guy.

778
01:02:47,269 --> 01:02:48,921
What's wrong?

779
01:02:49,321 --> 01:02:53,817
You don't want to leave, do you?
How can I go back, Juni?

780
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:59,162
In here, I can walk. I can run.

781
01:02:59,163 --> 01:03:04,901
And you look at me like
I am some kind of superhero. You are.

782
01:03:04,902 --> 01:03:09,672
Out there in the real world, to me.
You are.

783
01:03:09,673 --> 01:03:11,832
All right, Juni.

784
01:03:11,833 --> 01:03:14,034
I shall go back if...

785
01:03:14,035 --> 01:03:19,190
if you promise me that even
though I will be in a wheelchair,

786
01:03:19,941 --> 01:03:24,594
that you will look at me
no differently than you are now.

787
01:03:24,595 --> 01:03:31,301
Because on the inside, Juni,
on the inside, I feel like this.

788
01:03:33,311 --> 01:03:35,430
I promise, Grandpa.

789
01:03:37,899 --> 01:03:39,709
Time to go.

790
01:03:46,635 --> 01:03:49,103
Coming through.
Coming through, please.

791
01:03:49,104 --> 01:03:51,981
Those video games
are killers on the eyes, huh, kid?

792
01:03:51,982 --> 01:03:54,225
Agent Cortez, we will take it from here.

793
01:03:54,226 --> 01:03:56,118
My grandson will handle this.

794
01:03:56,119 --> 01:03:59,981
Don't touch.
This is Corinthian leather.

795
01:04:01,274 --> 01:04:03,818
(WHISPERING)

796
01:04:05,561 --> 01:04:10,106
Okay.
So tell me again how you shut off the game.

797
01:04:10,107 --> 01:04:12,191
I don't know if we shut it down, exactly.

798
01:04:12,192 --> 01:04:16,012
We hit a switch, and it seemed to work.
Oh, it worked. The game's down.

799
01:04:16,013 --> 01:04:19,114
We just need to make sure
we did this correctly.

800
01:04:19,115 --> 01:04:22,259
Actually, Grandpa hit the switch.

801
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:25,161
Cortez, are these the boys
that were in the game with you?

802
01:04:25,162 --> 01:04:27,172
We tracked them
through their e-mail addresses.

803
01:04:27,173 --> 01:04:30,658
Yeah, that's them.
They wouldn't know anything about...

804
01:04:30,659 --> 01:04:32,376
Hey, wait a second.

805
01:04:32,377 --> 01:04:34,795
What happened to Francis the Brain,

806
01:04:34,796 --> 01:04:37,081
Arnold the Strong, and Mr. Cool?

807
01:04:37,082 --> 01:04:40,417
Well, in the real world,
I am not that smart.

808
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:42,461
I am not strong.

809
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:44,188
I am not cool.

810
01:04:45,197 --> 01:04:48,708
Reality check.
So who are you out here in the real world?

811
01:04:48,709 --> 01:04:52,154
Special Agent Cortez, we need you.

812
01:04:52,738 --> 01:04:54,072
Whoa.

813
01:04:54,856 --> 01:04:57,608
I am just Juni Cortez.

814
01:04:57,609 --> 01:05:01,862
Let's have it, Grandpa.
What switch did you hit exactly?

815
01:05:01,863 --> 01:05:04,247
There were two switches side by side.

816
01:05:04,248 --> 01:05:07,909
One switch shuts down the game.
But the other releases the Toymaker.

817
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:10,379
Who was the idiot who designed that?

818
01:05:12,748 --> 01:05:18,540
Did you free the Toymaker by accident? Oh, I
freed the Toymaker. But it was no accident.

819
01:05:18,541 --> 01:05:20,879
Do you want to stop the game?

820
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:25,734
Then you must defeat the Toymaker.
It's the only way. You crazy old man!

821
01:05:25,735 --> 01:05:27,678
Do you know what you have done?

822
01:05:28,779 --> 01:05:31,838
Grandpa, revenge doesn't solve anything.

823
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:35,133
Will you trust me?
You of all people?

824
01:05:35,134 --> 01:05:38,696
A message from the president.
Oh, what does he want?

825
01:05:39,238 --> 01:05:43,101
I am coming back to settle the score.

826
01:05:43,541 --> 01:05:47,537
For imprisoning me.
For using me.

827
01:05:47,538 --> 01:05:49,413
Devlin set us up?

828
01:05:49,414 --> 01:05:50,999
It's not Devlin.

829
01:05:51,525 --> 01:05:57,221
All I wanted to do was right the wrongs.
Start over a new world.

830
01:05:57,222 --> 01:05:59,531
A new chance.

831
01:05:59,532 --> 01:06:03,636
Where everyone would get a second chance!

832
01:06:04,295 --> 01:06:05,863
But no.

833
01:06:07,423 --> 01:06:12,269
So now I am taking this to the next level!

834
01:06:14,813 --> 01:06:19,283
Seismic activity off the map!
Aah! Aah! Earthquake!

835
01:06:19,284 --> 01:06:20,784
Tornado!

836
01:06:20,785 --> 01:06:22,227
Hurricane!

837
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:26,490
Carmen, let's go!
Everybody, relax!

838
01:06:44,107 --> 01:06:45,946
Quick! Put your glasses on.

839
01:06:45,947 --> 01:06:49,085
It's the only way you can see
what's really happening.

840
01:06:49,086 --> 01:06:51,805
The game has entered the real world.

841
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:59,237
There's only one thing to do
in a situation like this. What?

842
01:06:59,837 --> 01:07:03,149
Call in the family.
Calling all Cortezes.

843
01:07:04,525 --> 01:07:07,604
This is it. This is it.

844
01:07:08,404 --> 01:07:09,588
This is it.

845
01:07:09,888 --> 01:07:14,058
The moment we have been waiting for.
Yes.

846
01:07:14,059 --> 01:07:16,545
Nobody move. Nobody move!

847
01:07:16,546 --> 01:07:19,939
Nobody touch the brain.
The fifth brain.

848
01:07:22,325 --> 01:07:26,712
This is a historic moment.
Probably the...

849
01:07:30,549 --> 01:07:35,011
Probably the most important... No.

850
01:07:35,812 --> 01:07:39,557
This is the most important
moment of my life.

851
01:07:40,975 --> 01:07:42,685
No one can disturb me now.

852
01:07:42,985 --> 01:07:46,537
I must activate the brain.

853
01:07:48,273 --> 01:07:50,408
- Now. Mr. Cortez?
- Eh?

854
01:07:50,409 --> 01:07:53,946
Your children called.
Some sort of emergency.

855
01:08:06,407 --> 01:08:08,251
Well, I am their uncle.

856
01:08:15,547 --> 01:08:19,260
Dad, you need these to see.
Glasses, quick!

857
01:08:29,011 --> 01:08:30,546
Incoming.

858
01:08:49,780 --> 01:08:51,465
This won't be easy.

859
01:08:57,028 --> 01:08:58,913
Let's kick some metal.

860
01:09:07,805 --> 01:09:10,024
What about all the other ones?

861
01:09:14,219 --> 01:09:16,862
We need more help.
Our family isn't big enough.

862
01:09:16,863 --> 01:09:20,538
Remember one thing.
Everyone's your family.

863
01:09:22,852 --> 01:09:26,231
Calling... everyone.

864
01:09:30,376 --> 01:09:32,661
We're here to save the day.

865
01:09:33,286 --> 01:09:34,663
Floop and Minion!

866
01:09:40,418 --> 01:09:41,853
Robot children!

867
01:09:43,254 --> 01:09:44,581
Take them down!

868
01:09:47,341 --> 01:09:49,160
Dinky Winks!

869
01:09:52,946 --> 01:09:55,733
Somebody ring the Dinkster?

870
01:09:59,786 --> 01:10:00,962
Whoa!

871
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:05,658
You're going to make a nice addition
to my theme park.

872
01:10:07,643 --> 01:10:10,888
Game over for you, pal.
Game over!

873
01:10:17,335 --> 01:10:19,454
Somebody call in a loon?

874
01:10:20,129 --> 01:10:22,672
Sorry, Romero,
this is the only pair we had left.

875
01:10:22,673 --> 01:10:26,611
They're a little broken.
They're perfect.

876
01:10:27,887 --> 01:10:29,597
Charge, Sporky!

877
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:32,799
Brand him, Daddy.

878
01:10:33,041 --> 01:10:35,027
Thanks, Little Dink.

879
01:10:42,367 --> 01:10:43,935
- Unh!
- Unh!

880
01:10:50,542 --> 01:10:51,775
Gary Giggles?

881
01:10:52,901 --> 01:10:54,526
- Yeah?
- Carmen Cortez.

882
01:10:54,527 --> 01:10:57,297
I need your help right away.
I am there.

883
01:11:00,525 --> 01:11:03,103
I am here.
Give me a hand.

884
01:11:04,495 --> 01:11:05,696
Whoa.

885
01:11:09,374 --> 01:11:11,376
- Unh!
- Thanks.

886
01:11:15,205 --> 01:11:17,073
- Hey.
- Hey.

887
01:11:18,716 --> 01:11:20,476
Thank you, Gerti.

888
01:11:20,727 --> 01:11:23,029
There's still one more.

889
01:11:37,475 --> 01:11:39,109
That's impossible.

890
01:11:39,110 --> 01:11:41,211
Someone has to go up there.

891
01:11:41,212 --> 01:11:43,213
And shut it down manually.

892
01:11:43,214 --> 01:11:45,549
It's the only way.

893
01:11:45,550 --> 01:11:47,043
But who?

894
01:11:47,943 --> 01:11:49,679
I am ready.

895
01:11:50,379 --> 01:11:52,545
It must be done.

896
01:11:54,624 --> 01:11:58,703
Grandpa, no! Juni, let him go.
Your grandfather has to do this.

897
01:12:08,863 --> 01:12:12,340
Thank you for freeing me,
Valentin, but it's too late.

898
01:12:12,341 --> 01:12:15,877
Nothing can stop me. Not even you.

899
01:12:16,136 --> 01:12:19,429
That's true. Only you can do that.

900
01:12:19,430 --> 01:12:21,698
You double-crossed us.

901
01:12:21,699 --> 01:12:24,976
The agency, your fellow agents, and me.

902
01:12:24,977 --> 01:12:28,462
Your mistake cost me my legs.

903
01:12:28,463 --> 01:12:34,785
Well, a mistake like that could only push
someone further into the dark. And it has.

904
01:12:34,786 --> 01:12:36,328
Look at you now.

905
01:12:36,329 --> 01:12:40,533
But I gave you back your legs when you were
in the game. I did that for you.

906
01:12:41,301 --> 01:12:45,637
Let me tell you all the things
I have missed in my life

907
01:12:45,638 --> 01:12:49,133
because of the accident you caused.

908
01:12:49,548 --> 01:12:52,552
I can't walk on the beach with my wife.

909
01:12:53,228 --> 01:12:56,639
I missed my daughter's birth.

910
01:12:56,982 --> 01:12:58,908
And "wedding".

911
01:13:00,059 --> 01:13:01,602
Shall I continue?

912
01:13:04,814 --> 01:13:06,391
Grandpa.

913
01:13:06,991 --> 01:13:08,358
Don't.

914
01:13:08,359 --> 01:13:13,321
Now let me tell you
all the good things that came of it.

915
01:13:14,039 --> 01:13:15,623
Humility.

916
01:13:15,624 --> 01:13:17,541
Spirituality.

917
01:13:17,542 --> 01:13:19,017
Understanding.

918
01:13:19,018 --> 01:13:22,871
You have been living in fear of me
all these years.

919
01:13:22,872 --> 01:13:29,703
But I have only been searching for you
so I could tell you that I forgive you.

920
01:13:34,182 --> 01:13:38,344
I have only dreamed I would hear
you say something like that.

921
01:13:38,345 --> 01:13:42,981
Now the question is,
can you forgive yourself?

922
01:13:42,982 --> 01:13:46,217
It's never too late, Sebastian.

923
01:13:46,218 --> 01:13:49,542
Take your time.
Take your time to decide.

924
01:13:49,543 --> 01:13:52,783
We have about 10 seconds.

925
01:13:57,654 --> 01:13:59,322
Game...

926
01:14:00,615 --> 01:14:01,866
over.

927
01:14:04,819 --> 01:14:07,330
Juni, get out of there!

928
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:29,575
Grandpa!

929
01:14:42,954 --> 01:14:44,647
So, wait a minute.

930
01:14:45,890 --> 01:14:47,242
Who won?

931
01:14:49,335 --> 01:14:55,874
It's not whether you win or lose.
It's how you play the game.

932
01:14:57,208 --> 01:14:58,531
To family.

933
01:14:58,793 --> 01:14:59,718

934
01:14:59,719 --> 01:15:01,086

940
01:15:12,231 --> 01:15:16,676

- To family.

941
01:15:20,513 --> 01:15:22,547

You...

Okay.

This is different.

Your mind belongs to the Toymaker. Aah!

I am coming back to settle the score.

He sounds just like you, honey.

1019
01:21:58,190 --> 01:22:00,989
That's what I am trying to tell you.
Why doesn't anyone try with me?

1020
01:22:00,990 --> 01:22:04,670
That's better.
Thank you, dear.

1021
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:09,569
How long have you known?
Since forever.

1022
01:22:09,570 --> 01:22:12,789
Mom made me swear not to mention it.
So why are you mentioning it?

1023
01:22:12,790 --> 01:22:16,230
Because she also told me
never to swear, so now we're even.

1024
01:22:16,730 --> 01:22:21,930
How's that for even? You're on your own.
Hey, wait! I warned you.
