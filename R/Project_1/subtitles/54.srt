I don't know why
I think it could be me.

No, no, I...

1582

So who is Prince Ali?

1583

I am Prince Ali.

1584
01:19:12,012 --> 01:19:13,915
But how would you
know the city so well?

1585
01:19:14,047 --> 01:19:15,750
I came to Agrabah early...

1586
01:19:15,882 --> 01:19:17,585
because to know a people,

1587
01:19:17,685 --> 01:19:18,819
you have to see them
for yourself.

But you already
know that.

1589
01:19:20,721 --> 01:19:23,991
When we first met,
you were disguised in your own city.

1590
01:19:24,123 --> 01:19:25,825
You saw us arrive

1591
01:19:25,926 --> 01:19:28,963
with dancers, an elephant,
and a magic carpet.

1592

How could a street thief
have all that?

1593

But how could I not
recognize you?

1594

People don't see the real you
when you're royalty.

1595
01:19:39,972 --> 01:19:43,010
I'm sorry.
I'm embarrassed.

1596
01:19:43,110 --> 01:19:45,713
I mean, you've seen
more of Agrabah in days

1597

in an entire lifetime.

than the best.

You said that wouldn't happen.

Wow! I mean, genie magic
is really just a facade.

Well, what?

1618
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:14,301
He told me he was only

pretending to be a thief
to see the city...

1620

a prince.

1621

I convinced her that
I really was a prince.

1623
01:21:21,507 --> 01:21:22,709
And she believed you?

1624
01:21:22,810 --> 01:21:23,811
I think so.

have to tell her the truth.

you want to believe him...
