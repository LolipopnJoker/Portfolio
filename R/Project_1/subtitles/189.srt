1
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:56,891
Come on.

2
00:00:57,559 --> 00:00:58,810
Come on!

3
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:10,572
Don't let him get away!

4
00:01:57,577 --> 00:01:58,703
Get inside now!

5
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,955
Hurry up! You're late!

6
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,710
Proxima's gonna have your hide.

7
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:08,671
Get back in the den.

8
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:11,924
Look what I stole!

9
00:02:12,008 --> 00:02:13,676
Proxima'll give me an extra portion for this!

10
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:15,636
Nope, I think she's gonna
give that extra portion to me.

11
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:16,804
Hey, give it back!

12
00:02:16,888 --> 00:02:17,889
It belongs to whoever's holding it!

13
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:18,973
And that's not you!

14
00:02:19,057 --> 00:02:20,058
Lex!

15
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:21,517
Full Sabacc!

16
00:02:21,684 --> 00:02:22,727
Idiot's Array.

17
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,896
- What? Let me see that!
- Nope, it's my card.

18
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:26,105
You cheat.

19
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:27,982
Han!

20
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:33,404
You were gone too long!

21
00:02:33,488 --> 00:02:34,864
I knew something must've gone wrong.

22
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:36,574
This is nothing. You should see them.

23
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:37,992
Look down here!

24
00:02:38,743 --> 00:02:39,952
All right, listen.

25
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:42,538
I was in the middle of the exchange,
I'm handing over the coaxium

26
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:44,290
and his goons jumped me, but I showed 'em.

27
00:02:44,457 --> 00:02:45,458
How?

28
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,001
I ran away, then I boosted their speeder.

29
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,169
What, are we going somewhere?

30
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:50,296
Yeah, anywhere we want.

31
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,424
You held on to one of the vials?

32
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:54,592
Han's back!

33
00:02:57,095 --> 00:02:58,596
This, this is worth...

34
00:02:58,763 --> 00:02:59,847
Five, six hundred credits.

35
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:01,682
That's more than you said we'd need.

36
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,935
To buy our way out of the control zone.

37
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:05,436
And off Corellia.

38
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:08,689
Han, this could work.

39
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:09,857
This is gonna work.

40
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:12,235
Qi'ra, you always said one day
we're gonna get out of here.

41
00:03:12,402 --> 00:03:13,444
This is it.

42
00:03:15,113 --> 00:03:16,739
What are we waiting for?

43
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:24,080
There he is. Hey, you two!

44
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:27,125
Look who we have here.

45
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,918
Moloch. Hi, how are ya?

46
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:31,129
I was just on my way to see Lady Proxima.

47
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:33,923
You have our money?

48
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,342
What a night I had.

49
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:37,969
You're not gonna believe it.
You'll believe it, but...

50
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:39,470
Search him.

51
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,347
Hold still, scrumrat!

52
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:44,725
Easy.

53
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:46,310
Come on.

54
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:47,728
All right.

55
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:49,772
Let's go see Lady Proxima.

56
00:04:10,543 --> 00:04:13,337
Well, what happened?

57
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:14,672
I'll tell you what happened.

58
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:16,757
They double-crossed you and tried to kill me.

59
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:17,925
The money?

60
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,261
- They kept it.
- And my coaxium?

61
00:04:21,137 --> 00:04:22,138
They kept that, too.

62
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:23,681
But we learned a very valuable lesson.

63
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:25,933
We cannot trust those guys.

64
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:28,102
So you expect me to believe

65
00:04:28,186 --> 00:04:30,646
that you walked away with nothing!

66
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:34,859
I ran away with my life.
I think that's something.

67
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:36,986
To me, that's a lot.

68
00:04:37,153 --> 00:04:39,906
I trusted you with a simple task,

69
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:42,158
and all I'm hearing are excuses.

70
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:48,873
There must be consequences for disobedience

71
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,417
or else you never learn.

72
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:58,925
You know what?

73
00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:01,928
I don't think I'm ever gonna learn.

74
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:03,638
What did you say?

75
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:07,433
I said, next time somebody hits me,

76
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:09,685
I hit 'em back.

77
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:11,395
Not if I shoot you.

78
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,440
Moloch, wait!

79
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:16,192
Don't!

80
00:05:16,651 --> 00:05:18,486
Qi'ra, remember the Silo?

81
00:05:18,653 --> 00:05:20,655
We pulled you out of that horror,

82
00:05:20,738 --> 00:05:22,240
gave you a home.

83
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:25,618
Don't throw it away for Han.
He's not worth it!

84
00:05:25,785 --> 00:05:29,121
Whatever he lost on the deal,
we'll earn it back, double.

85
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:30,706
We will make it up to you.

86
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,458
Coaxium is precious.

87
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,210
Scrumrats like you come cheap.

88
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,338
Everybody, stand back!

89
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:38,756
What's that supposed to be?

90
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:40,675
This is a thermal detonator

91
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,718
that I just armed.

92
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:45,388
- That's a rock!
- No, it's not.

93
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:46,639
Yes, it is!

94
00:05:46,806 --> 00:05:47,974
And you just made

95
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:49,350
a clicking sound with your mouth.

96
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:51,018
Please tell me this isn't your plan.

97
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:52,520
No, this is.

98
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:04,073
- Get in!
- An M-68?

99
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,242
- Nice, right?
- I love it!

100
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:15,042
Whoa!

101
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:41,777
There's a starliner leaving
from Coronet Spaceport,

102
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:43,112
we're gonna be on it.

103
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:47,074
We bribe our way through the
checkpoint, and we're free.

104
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:49,910
I'm gonna be a pilot.

105
00:06:50,286 --> 00:06:51,370
We can get our own ship.

106
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:53,289
See the galaxy, all of it.

107
00:06:54,332 --> 00:06:57,668
We won't have to take orders
or be kicked around by anyone.

108
00:06:58,711 --> 00:06:59,712
Ever.

109
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:05,051
Thought we'd get
a little more of a head start.

110
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:23,402
- Whoa!
- Hang on!

111
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,538
<i>This is a secure area.</i>

112
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:36,415
<i>You must have proper clearance.</i>

113
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:39,168
<i>Stop at once! You must follow the proper...</i>

114
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:41,420
<i>Protocol.</i>

115
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,425
Damn! That stinger's fast.

116
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:49,095
Yeah, but we're faster, right?

117
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:50,346
I hope so.

118
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:21,752
<i>Pull over!</i>

119
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:44,942
Han, no, we're not gonna make it!

120
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,026
Oh, yeah?

121
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,570
Han, I'm telling you, it's too tight!

122
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,196
Watch this.

123
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,593
Bring the hounds.

124
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:12,553
After them!

125
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:14,597
Come on!

126
00:09:15,473 --> 00:09:16,849
We gotta move.

127
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,906
<i>Do not join the line
if you don't have a boarding pass.</i>

128
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:35,743
<i>No access without ID chip.</i>

129
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:39,038
<i>All droids must be registered.</i>

130
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:42,333
<i>Move along. Move along.</i>

131
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:46,879
<i>Stand down. Do not resist!</i>

132
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,757
- <i>Stop struggling.</i>
- Let me go!

133
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,841
<i>Take his arm.</i>

134
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:53,135
- <i>I got him.</i>
- <i>Take him to cell 3B.</i>

135
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:54,845
<i>This way, come on.</i>

136
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,681
<i>Keep moving. Hold it, hold it.</i>

137
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,018
Next.

138
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:06,899
Han, they're here.

139
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,611
<i>Hey, what are you...</i>

140
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,739
We're almost there.

141
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:15,199
- Just hold on to me.
- Next.

142
00:10:15,366 --> 00:10:16,575
Don't look back.

143
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:21,413
Once we're through, we've gotta be smart,
figure out where we're going.

144
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:23,666
Anywhere the Empire isn't. Wherever we go,

145
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:25,251
it can't be worse than where we've been.

146
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:28,629
Yes, it can. Out there,
we've got no protection.

147
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:30,881
We could get snatched up by traffickers,

148
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:33,384
sold to Crimson Dawn or the Hutt Cartel.

149
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:35,094
That's not gonna happen.

150
00:10:35,261 --> 00:10:36,637
I won't let it.

151
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:45,646
For luck?

152
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:47,940
Damn right.

153
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:53,112
<i>You heard him. Let's go.</i>

154
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,280
Next.

155
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:58,284
ID chips.

156
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,828
Funny thing, we don't have 'em.

157
00:11:00,995 --> 00:11:01,996
We have this.

158
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,372
Refined hyperfuel.

159
00:11:03,873 --> 00:11:06,792
It's worth at least 800 credits, maybe more.

160
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:09,879
You could be detained just for having that.

161
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:11,922
What good would that do anybody?

162
00:11:12,006 --> 00:11:13,883
Let us through, it's all yours.

163
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,644
The coaxium, now.

164
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:27,521
As we're going through, not before.

165
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,736
Do it.

166
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:37,114
Just do it, do it.

167
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:43,203
Not so fast, Qi'ra! Come on!

168
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:45,331
Wait! Open the door!

169
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,166
Security! Security, there has been a breach!

170
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,418
Open the door!

171
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:51,670
- Run! Run!
- Get your hands off of her!

172
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:52,755
Run!

173
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:54,798
Get your hands off of her!

174
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:56,675
Qi'ra!

175
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:59,178
Run, Han! Go!

176
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:00,679
Keep moving.

177
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:03,849
Qi'ra!

178
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:05,017
Run!

179
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,101
<i>Traveler has been apprehended.</i>

180
00:12:06,352 --> 00:12:09,855
Qi'ra, I'll come back! I'll come back!

181
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:13,859
<i>All units, there has been a breach.</i>

182
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:17,488
<i>Another unauthorized traveler
made it through the gate.</i>

183
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,740
One got through the gate! Look over there!

184
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:21,742
<i>Someone got through the checkpoint.</i>

185
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,877
- Keep an eye on that gate.
- Yes, sir.

186
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:33,212
Can't let you through without a ticket.

187
00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:35,130
Can't let you through without a ticket.

188
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:37,299
Hey, wait!

189
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,301
- Hey!
- <i>Come with us.</i>

190
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:43,639
<i>He's still out there. Keep looking.</i>

191
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:57,194
<i>You there, stop!</i>

192
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:59,238
- <i>Show me some identification.</i>
- Please. Please. No, no!

193
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:00,948
<i>Do not resist.</i>

194
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:04,493
<i>Be a part of something. Join the Empire.</i>

195
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,497
<i>Explore new worlds. Learn valuable skills.</i>

196
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:12,001
<i>Bring order and unity to the galaxy!</i>

197
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:15,713
<i>Be a part of something. Join the Empire.</i>

198
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:19,508
This is where I sign up to be a pilot, right?

199
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:22,594
If you apply for the Imperial Navy,
but most recruits go into the infantry.

200
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:25,973
I'm gonna be a pilot. Best in the galaxy.

201
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,683
You there, come with us.

202
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:28,809
Who, me?

203
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:30,436
We have a few questions to ask you.

204
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:32,479
How long is that gonna take?

205
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,815
Depends on how good you are
at following orders.

206
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:36,442
Why, have you got somewhere to be?

207
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:38,402
Yeah, back here, as soon as I can.

208
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:42,698
Don't hear that much. What's your name, son?

209
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:44,116
Han.

210
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:45,993
Han what?

211
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:48,579
Who are your people?

212
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:55,419
I don't have people. I'm alone.

213
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:57,629
Han...

214
00:14:00,758 --> 00:14:01,800
Solo.

215
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,344
Approved.

216
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:08,515
Proceed to transport ID 83 for
the Naval Academy at Carida.

217
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:11,101
Good luck, Han Solo.

218
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:13,687
We'll have you flying in no time.

219
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:29,703
Your Empire needs you. Troopers forward!

220
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,538
Solo, get up! We're almost there!

221
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:34,541
Almost where? Where are we going?

222
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,419
Just over that last ridge. Victory is...

223
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:51,517
My legs! My leg!

224
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,492
<i>Hey, Beckett, you said we were here</i>

225
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:09,660
<i>to pull a quick job.</i>

226
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:11,745
- Yeah.
- <i>Well, this ain't a quick job!</i>

227
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,205
<i>It's a war!</i>

228
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,833
It's always something with you.

229
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,503
AT-hauler. That's what we came for.

230
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:22,756
Forward operations must be this way.

231
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:25,217
They are, but the major said
we're supposed to go that way!

232
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:27,177
Yeah, go that way and die!

233
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:29,555
That's exactly what happened to the major!

234
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:32,099
Who's the ranking officer now?

235
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:34,059
You are, Captain.

236
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:37,563
<i>He's got you there.</i>

237
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:41,608
So what's the plan, Captain Beckett?

238
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:45,028
Val, you take Rio and these
four mud skulls flank left.

239
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:46,989
I'll take this mouthy scooch

240
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:49,158
and we'll go around to the right

241
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:50,409
and maybe we'll get lucky.

242
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:52,035
<i>Luck's got nothin' to do with it.</i>

243
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,496
Wait! One question!

244
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:57,207
- You wanna live, sparky?
- Very much.

245
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,501
Then shut up and do what
your captain tells you.

246
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,045
Let's go!

247
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:17,477
Captain.

248
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,396
<i>T-15s are down. We walk from here.</i>

249
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:20,898
Captain.

250
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:24,151
I'm Han.

251
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,653
Nobody cares.

252
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,157
Thanks for your help back there.

253
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:31,533
You did all right.

254
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,161
I was trained in aerial combat...

255
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:36,038
You want some advice?

256
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:37,539
Get the hell away from here.

257
00:16:37,623 --> 00:16:40,167
Any way you can, as fast as you can.

258
00:16:43,462 --> 00:16:44,838
What company do you command?

259
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:46,340
None of your business company.

260
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,300
And we're full up.

261
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:50,344
<i>Stick to soldiering, kid.</i>

262
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:52,054
<i>You don't want any part of this.</i>

263
00:16:58,477 --> 00:16:59,728
<i>Hang on, guys!</i>

264
00:17:01,897 --> 00:17:03,315
Attention!

265
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,401
In three hours, we move out
for the southern marshlands.

266
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:09,029
I want an advance party of ten men.

267
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:10,822
Great, more mud.

268
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:12,574
What was that?

269
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:15,827
Just wondering what our
objective is, Lieutenant.

270
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:18,956
Bring peace and prosperity to the galaxy,

271
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:20,874
install a regime loyal to the Emperor,

272
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,376
and eradicate the hostiles.

273
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:25,212
It's their planet, we're the hostiles.

274
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:27,714
You got a problem, trooper?

275
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,259
No problem, sir.

276
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:34,137
Moving out.

277
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:36,890
To the southern marshlands! Move out!

278
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:39,226
You heard 'em! Let's move out!

279
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:50,779
Mmm. Looks like they're running
sorties every 30 minutes.

280
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:53,198
Yeah, I can take out the
guards at the perimeter,

281
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:54,825
signalman, pilot.

282
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:56,368
Hell, I'll just take 'em all out.

283
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:57,828
What are we looking at?

284
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:03,458
You have a talent for sticking your nose in

285
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:04,710
where it doesn't belong.

286
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:06,044
I just couldn't help but notice

287
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:08,588
you're wearing a uniform
pock-full of laser burns.

288
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,632
So either you heal real quick

289
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:13,343
or you stole it off a dead man.

290
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,845
You're not Imperial Army.

291
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,306
You're thieves here to steal equipment

292
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:18,724
for a job and I want in.

293
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:21,643
- Well, now we gotta shoot him.
- No.

294
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:24,438
Snap his neck. It's less mess.

295
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:25,772
Or you take me with you.

296
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:28,525
Look, I came up running scams
on the streets of Corellia.

297
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:31,069
I was boosting AV-21s when I was ten.

298
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:32,821
I'm a driver, a flyer,

299
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:36,533
and hey, you said yourself.
I gotta get outta here. Right?

300
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,744
<i>What's a fancy flyboy doing down in the mud?</i>

301
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:42,247
I got kicked out of the Imperial Academy

302
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:43,832
for having a mind of my own.

303
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:47,252
But I am a great pilot. And I gotta get home.

304
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:49,880
<i>This guy is nuts.
No one goes back to Corellia.</i>

305
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:51,506
I got a reason.

306
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:53,759
We've already got a great pilot.

307
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:56,386
The Ardennian.

308
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:58,472
<i>Ardennian? You got a lot of nerve, pal.</i>

309
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:00,223
<i>I'm an Imperial trooper.</i>

310
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:02,392
Oh, really? A couple of your arms
popped out of your butt

311
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:03,852
and hiked up your pants, trooper.

312
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:04,936
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

313
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,064
Look, I'll do whatever it
takes to get back to Corellia.

314
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,899
I've already been away too long.

315
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:10,567
Just give me a shot.

316
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:11,943
<i>Whoa. Hold it.</i>

317
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:15,697
Well, if you're not interested in me,

318
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:18,992
I think the lieutenant might
be very interested in you.

319
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:23,747
Blackmail.

320
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:27,125
Lieutenant.

321
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:28,210
Captain.

322
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:31,254
Lieutenant, we have apprehended a deserter.

323
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:32,381
Take him.

324
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:33,548
Wait.

325
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,051
I should've known. This one's a troublemaker.

326
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:37,427
And a liar.

327
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:38,553
Don't believe anything he says.

328
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:40,680
- Don't go anywhere without me.
- <i>All right, let's go.</i>

329
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,057
Feed him to the beast.

330
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:43,683
The beast? Wait, there's a beast?

331
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:44,768
- Hold on!
- <i>Move it!</i>

332
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:46,978
Listen, that guy's not
even an officer. All right?

333
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:48,438
- He was lying!
- <i>Quiet!</i>

334
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:51,817
<i>Don't care.</i>

335
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,904
<i>Haven't fed him in three days.</i>

336
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:57,155
<i>Should be fun.</i>

337
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:46,663
Oh! Hey! Hey, big fella.

338
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,416
Just calm down. Take it easy.

339
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:50,876
We're on the same side.

340
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:52,252
You like treats?

341
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:56,339
Help! Let me out of here!

342
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:57,716
Let me out of here!

343
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:03,221
A-ha! Gotcha!

344
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:10,645
Ahhh!

345
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:25,243
<i>Ah, this was just getting good.</i>

346
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,953
- <i>He killed him too fast.</i>
- <i>Yeah!</i>

347
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,413
<i>Kill him slower.</i>

348
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,667
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

349
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:35,128
Wait! Wait!

350
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:40,133
Yeah, I speak a little.

351
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:41,343
Now just listen to me, you...

352
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,677
You dumb Wookiee!

353
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:50,227
Me have plan of break out.

354
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:54,523
You and I freedom make...
by secret battle of pretend.

355
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:58,735
Look... big... stick...

356
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:03,240
Yes, yes!

357
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:05,700
No, no, no, no!

358
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:08,995
Do it!

359
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:10,539
Come on.

360
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:13,833
Oh, no!

361
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,002
<i>Ten credits, he doesn't last another minute.</i>

362
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:17,879
Let me out of here!

363
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:19,422
I can't take it anymore!

364
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:22,551
- Oh, no! Stop, please!
- <i>That's it. Get him!</i>

365
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:27,264
You tired, you mangy Kashyyykian moof-milker?

366
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:41,486
See what happens when you listen to me?

367
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:43,488
Hey, what are you doing?

368
00:22:45,824 --> 00:22:47,492
Ow.

369
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:51,496
Follow me!

370
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,842
Wait, wait.

371
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:05,594
Come here. Listen to me.

372
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,761
You don't understand, okay?

373
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:08,972
I have some very good friends
waiting for me at that airfield.

374
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:10,390
They're leaving right now.

375
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:12,017
That's our one way off this mud ball.

376
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:13,768
If you wanna live, we go that way.

377
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:16,146
After that, you go whichever
way you want, I don't care!

378
00:23:16,313 --> 00:23:18,398
But right now, that's the way you go!

379
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:22,110
Trust me!

380
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:25,530
Val, let's go!

381
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:30,702
How do they breathe in these
suits? It's so stuffy!

382
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:33,413
No wonder they're such lousy pilots.

383
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,166
You can't turn your head, you can't
breathe, you can't hear each other!

384
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:44,758
I'll be damned.

385
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,259
Hey, look who's back!

386
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:47,510
Unbelievable!

387
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:49,304
Wait!

388
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:51,139
Wait!

389
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:54,059
Whoa, is that a Wookiee? Incredible!

390
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:55,393
I'll say it, I don't care.

391
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,103
This kid's growing on me.

392
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:59,105
Wait!

393
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:05,320
You know, we could always use
some muscle on a job like this.

394
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:07,697
Don't even think about it!

395
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:10,367
I'm telling you, you will
never have a deeper sleep

396
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:12,118
than curled up in a Wookiee's lap.

397
00:24:17,832 --> 00:24:20,460
I told you!

398
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:22,629
Very good friends!

399
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,615
We couldn't have done this
maybe, like, one at a time?

400
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:20,562
Thanks for helping me get outta there.

401
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:28,695
No, they only took you because of me.

402
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:30,572
Hey!

403
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,533
I got us a real sweet deal here.

404
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,660
We do this one job with them,

405
00:25:35,827 --> 00:25:37,704
we make some real money,

406
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:39,706
and then we're free.

407
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:41,958
When's the last time you could say that?

408
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,672
Been a while for me, too.

409
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,259
So what's your name, anyway?

410
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:56,473
Chewbacca?

411
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:59,559
All right, well, you're gonna
need a nickname,

412
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:01,644
'cause I ain't saying that every time.

413
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:07,901
Here it comes. Take a look.

414
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:08,985
Yeah.

415
00:26:09,152 --> 00:26:12,697
We hit the Conveyex between
the tower and the bridge.

416
00:26:13,114 --> 00:26:16,409
Rio drops us in, we separate
the payload container,

417
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:19,037
cable it up to the AT-hauler and then...

418
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:20,830
Rio jams their distress signal.

419
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:22,957
I blow the bridge,

420
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,584
the container slides right off the track

421
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:25,960
and we sail away.

422
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:27,879
You trip that security beam,

423
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:29,297
wake up those Vipers,

424
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,382
it's liable to get real spicy, real fast.

425
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:33,468
Well, I'm not the one
you should be worried about.

426
00:26:33,885 --> 00:26:34,886
Enfys Nest.

427
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:36,638
What's an Enfys Nest?

428
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:38,056
I told you, we're way ahead

429
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:39,516
of the competition on this one.

430
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:41,059
There's no way Enfys Nest

431
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:43,061
even knows about this shipment.

432
00:26:43,228 --> 00:26:44,729
Only my guy has the intel.

433
00:26:44,896 --> 00:26:47,357
Well, you better be right. Yeah?

434
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:49,734
Because sometimes, you put your faith

435
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:51,361
in the wrong people.

436
00:26:53,238 --> 00:26:55,657
<i>Our whole future depends on this one score</i>

437
00:26:55,824 --> 00:26:57,075
<i>and you bring in amateurs.</i>

438
00:26:57,242 --> 00:26:59,744
<i>In case you hadn't noticed,
we're a little shorthanded.</i>

439
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:01,287
So we get who we need.

440
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:03,957
The Xan sisters, or Bossk.

441
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,668
But, no, instead you're putting our lives

442
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:08,127
in the hands of morons.

443
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:10,338
You guys morons?

444
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:11,673
No!

445
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,383
- No. See?
- We're not morons.

446
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,386
Look, I waited a long time
for a shot like this.

447
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:18,555
I'm not about to screw it up, all right?

448
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:20,139
Oh, come on, Val!

449
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:21,850
He looks so sincere.

450
00:27:22,016 --> 00:27:23,476
Plus, have you ever tried to disinvite

451
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,644
a Wookiee to anything?

452
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:26,604
Not a good idea!

453
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:28,606
This is not funny!

454
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:33,069
Look, now, I have great
instincts about these guys.

455
00:27:33,236 --> 00:27:36,865
And, besides, do you see any other options?

456
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:38,283
I just hope you know what you're doing.

457
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:41,077
Yeah, I know exactly what I'm doing and why.

458
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:42,912
We're gonna clear our debts,

459
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:45,081
go back to Glee Anselm,

460
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:48,501
and I'm finally gonna learn
how to play that valachord.

461
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:51,129
Babe, you're never gonna learn
how to play the valachord.

462
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:53,089
She's right. You are tone-deaf.

463
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:58,469
So what's your sob story, flyboy?

464
00:27:58,636 --> 00:27:59,637
Who, me?

465
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:01,681
You're after something, I know the look.

466
00:28:01,848 --> 00:28:03,516
What is it? Revenge?

467
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:05,977
No, it's not revenge.

468
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:07,353
Look at him.

469
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,022
If it's anything, it's a girl.

470
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:10,148
Oh, a girl!

471
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:12,650
Tell us about the girl, Han. Is she nice?

472
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:14,986
Does she have sharp teeth?

473
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:19,449
There was a girl.

474
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:23,578
But I got out, she didn't.

475
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:27,999
I swore to myself I'd become a pilot,

476
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:29,709
get a ship,

477
00:28:29,876 --> 00:28:31,169
go back and find her.

478
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:35,840
That's what I'm gonna do
right after this job.

479
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:38,259
How you know she'll still be there?

480
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:40,261
I just know.

481
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:42,513
Personally, I refuse to be tied down

482
00:28:42,597 --> 00:28:44,349
by anyone, though many have tried.

483
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:47,018
Come on, Rio. You don't fool me.

484
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:49,395
Everybody needs somebody.

485
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:53,816
Even a broken down old crook like this one.

486
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:06,537
How about you? What are you
gonna do with your share?

487
00:29:19,342 --> 00:29:20,760
What was he saying?

488
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:22,387
He said the Wookiees were enslaved

489
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,389
by the Empire, taken off Kashyyyk.

490
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:27,308
He's searching for his, uh...

491
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:30,353
I don't know if he said tribe or family.

492
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:32,689
What's the difference?

493
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,151
Show me how to do that.

494
00:29:37,652 --> 00:29:39,779
The only thing you need to learn to do

495
00:29:42,532 --> 00:29:44,951
is do what I say when I say it.

496
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:46,869
And this time tomorrow,

497
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:48,746
you'll have more than enough

498
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:50,540
to buy your own ship.

499
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:13,229
<i>Starting the clock.</i>

500
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:15,773
Jamming their signal. 9.6 to the bridge.

501
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,568
<i>Let's find out how good we really are, folks.</i>

502
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:31,039
I'm fine!

503
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:36,794
Val, how's it going up there?

504
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:42,550
Never better.

505
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,033
Coaxium.

506
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,202
Enough to power a fleet!

507
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,496
Or blow us all straight to hell!

508
00:31:14,457 --> 00:31:15,500
<i>All right, talk to me.</i>

509
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,085
Is it a good day?

510
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,753
<i>It's a great day!</i>

511
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,506
Best day of your life, my grabby friend!

512
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:22,965
I don't know, you've never been

513
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:24,425
to a Mynock roast on Ardennia.

514
00:31:24,592 --> 00:31:25,676
It's nuts!

515
00:31:28,346 --> 00:31:29,430
Here they come!

516
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:31,140
Get down to the couplers!

517
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:32,934
Rio, fall back!

518
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:34,185
Well, that didn't take 'em long.

519
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:53,746
Chewie!

520
00:32:09,804 --> 00:32:11,430
You all right?

521
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:13,391
Little close there, buddy!

522
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,564
Han, what's the holdup?

523
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:21,858
All right, together.

524
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:25,153
Now!

525
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:32,618
All right!

526
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:34,162
Oh!

527
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:40,877
They got one uncoupled. Where are you, buddy?

528
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:43,212
<i>Just up here planning my retirement.</i>

529
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:46,048
Thinking about opening a cantina somewhere
warm but not too warm, you know?

530
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:48,718
Lowering the winch cables now!

531
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:07,945
I knew it! I told him! Beckett!

532
00:33:08,112 --> 00:33:09,488
<i>He's coming!</i>

533
00:33:10,448 --> 00:33:13,159
Damn it! I'm never gonna
hear the end of this!

534
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:18,956
Who's that?

535
00:33:19,123 --> 00:33:20,458
Enfys Nest!

536
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:22,376
Marauders, pirates.

537
00:33:22,543 --> 00:33:24,212
Come to snake the score from under us.

538
00:33:25,296 --> 00:33:26,797
<i>Ready your harpoons.</i>

539
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:28,174
<i>Move in.</i>

540
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:10,675
Hang on! I got an uninvited guest.

541
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:14,387
Get off of my ship!

542
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:20,476
You still with us, brother?

543
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:22,144
Yeah, I'm okay.

544
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:24,480
Just nicked one of my
shoulders. It's nothing.

545
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:26,107
He's not okay.

546
00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:34,240
Chewie!

547
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:37,201
You gotta uncouple this one on your own!

548
00:34:42,957 --> 00:34:44,166
Han!

549
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:45,501
I'm on it!

550
00:34:55,136 --> 00:34:56,137
Val!

551
00:34:56,304 --> 00:34:59,056
<i>Keep your eyes open.
We just tripped a sensor.</i>

552
00:35:04,395 --> 00:35:06,188
Viper droids headed your way!

553
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:09,233
Rio?

554
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,152
Yeah, it looks worse than it is.

555
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:13,404
Just gotta patch it up.

556
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,615
Maybe rest my eyes for a minute.

557
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:38,721
<i>Enough! I'm going in.</i>

558
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:05,664
You weren't lying, kid.

559
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:08,209
You're a hell of a pilot.

560
00:36:08,376 --> 00:36:10,419
Rio, stay with me, buddy.

561
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:25,017
Beckett, we just lost a cable!

562
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:28,104
<i>2. 1 to the bridge!</i>

563
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:33,692
It's no good to die alone, kid.

564
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:36,570
Val was right.

565
00:36:39,198 --> 00:36:40,282
Rio?

566
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:12,731
Beckett, we're.8 from the bridge!

567
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,942
<i>Val's still on the track!</i>

568
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:17,111
Val, you gotta get off that bridge!

569
00:37:17,278 --> 00:37:18,362
We're here!

570
00:37:22,616 --> 00:37:24,076
They got me pinned!

571
00:37:24,368 --> 00:37:26,537
I'm gonna have to finish
the job from right here.

572
00:37:26,787 --> 00:37:27,955
What?

573
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:30,249
It's been a ride, babe.

574
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:33,794
And I wouldn't trade it for anything.

575
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:35,212
<i>Val!</i>

576
00:37:35,296 --> 00:37:36,297
No!

577
00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:44,388
No!

578
00:37:57,985 --> 00:37:59,612
Chewie, now!

579
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:24,720
<i>Beckett, I can't pull it away from 'em.</i>

580
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:27,556
They'll let go, you fly straight!

581
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,143
<i>Release your cables</i>

582
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:32,811
<i>or die!</i>

583
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:35,064
We're too close.

584
00:38:35,231 --> 00:38:36,232
I gotta release.

585
00:38:36,398 --> 00:38:37,650
You do what I tell you, Han!

586
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:38,859
Chewie, grab the line!

587
00:38:39,026 --> 00:38:40,277
Don't you do it!

588
00:38:43,656 --> 00:38:44,740
Han!

589
00:38:44,907 --> 00:38:46,450
<i>You coward!</i>

590
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:36,875
What the hell?

591
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:40,129
You don't listen and you can't follow orders!

592
00:39:40,296 --> 00:39:42,715
You have any idea what you've done?

593
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:45,509
We were not stealing for ourselves,

594
00:39:45,676 --> 00:39:48,262
we were hired by Crimson Dawn.

595
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:52,725
Crimson Dawn?

596
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:55,144
Now we owe them 100 keys of refined coaxium.

597
00:39:55,311 --> 00:39:57,605
When they find out we don't got it,

598
00:39:57,771 --> 00:39:59,523
they're gonna kill us.

599
00:40:00,774 --> 00:40:02,484
Right.

600
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:03,652
We run.

601
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:06,822
I'm already a deserter.
What's the difference?

602
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:07,906
The difference

603
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:09,742
is the Empire doesn't send out

604
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:11,827
a team of enforcers to hunt you down

605
00:40:11,994 --> 00:40:13,370
when you're a deserter.

606
00:40:13,537 --> 00:40:15,080
Dryden Vos will.

607
00:40:17,124 --> 00:40:18,459
You have any idea what it's like

608
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:20,669
to live with a price on your head?

609
00:40:21,587 --> 00:40:24,173
The only thing to do is to go to them.

610
00:40:24,381 --> 00:40:26,967
Maybe I can find some way
to make it up to him.

611
00:40:31,347 --> 00:40:33,015
Then that's what we do.

612
00:40:37,561 --> 00:40:38,771
No.

613
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:45,194
He knows me, not you.

614
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,656
If you come with me

615
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:51,241
and show your face,

616
00:40:51,617 --> 00:40:53,661
if they don't kill you,

617
00:40:54,912 --> 00:40:57,039
you're in this life for good.

618
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:02,169
You find some way to square this,

619
00:41:04,088 --> 00:41:05,923
we still get our money?

620
00:41:07,841 --> 00:41:09,426
Maybe.

621
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,264
For me, it's worth the risk.

622
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,810
How about you?

623
00:41:24,608 --> 00:41:26,276
That's yes.

624
00:41:28,487 --> 00:41:31,573
Sorry I punched your face.

625
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,326
Happens more often than you think.

626
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,162
So when we get up there,

627
00:41:37,246 --> 00:41:39,206
Dryden Vos is waiting for us at Fort Ypso?

628
00:41:39,373 --> 00:41:41,875
Nearby, on his yacht.

629
00:41:42,418 --> 00:41:44,294
You're gonna know how to find it?

630
00:41:44,461 --> 00:41:46,422
That won't be a problem.

631
00:42:27,546 --> 00:42:29,590
I'll need to check your weapons.

632
00:42:31,467 --> 00:42:32,634
That's all I got left.

633
00:43:09,338 --> 00:43:13,008
Welcome back, Tobias Beckett.

634
00:43:13,509 --> 00:43:16,345
I'm here to see Dryden. He's expecting me.

635
00:43:16,512 --> 00:43:17,888
He'll be with you shortly.

636
00:43:18,347 --> 00:43:19,848
He's just finishing
with the regional governor.

637
00:43:25,187 --> 00:43:26,438
Excuse me, sir.

638
00:43:26,522 --> 00:43:27,523
Yes.

639
00:43:27,606 --> 00:43:30,317
- Beckett has arrived.
- Oh.

640
00:43:32,486 --> 00:43:36,073
Put this in my office.
I might be needing it later.

641
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:45,332
I get all worked up. Silly.

642
00:43:45,499 --> 00:43:46,792
It's a party.

643
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:51,380
Hey.

644
00:43:51,964 --> 00:43:54,424
These people are not your friends

645
00:43:54,591 --> 00:43:57,302
and they're never gonna be,
so don't talk to any of 'em.

646
00:43:57,469 --> 00:43:58,679
Don't look at anybody,

647
00:43:58,846 --> 00:44:00,556
just keep your eyes down.

648
00:44:04,184 --> 00:44:05,602
I might get a drink.

649
00:44:18,657 --> 00:44:19,908
No, yeah, whatever.

650
00:44:38,427 --> 00:44:40,888
Chewie, would you please...

651
00:44:49,855 --> 00:44:51,481
Qi'ra, what are you doing here?

652
00:44:51,648 --> 00:44:53,108
I work here.

653
00:44:53,275 --> 00:44:54,902
What's your excuse?

654
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:56,403
My... I...

655
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:58,238
Qi'ra, I was...

656
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:02,659
I was coming back for you.

657
00:45:03,493 --> 00:45:05,203
It's in the past, Han.

658
00:45:05,287 --> 00:45:06,288
Not for me.

659
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:08,498
The only reason I'm here,
I was doing this job, get a little money

660
00:45:08,665 --> 00:45:10,876
and then I was gonna come back
to Corellia and find you.

661
00:45:11,335 --> 00:45:13,629
Well, now you don't have to.

662
00:45:14,421 --> 00:45:16,381
I'm right in front of you.

663
00:45:18,634 --> 00:45:19,843
That day...

664
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:21,595
Sometimes, a lot of times, I think...

665
00:45:21,762 --> 00:45:23,013
If you'd have stayed,

666
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:26,224
they would've killed you.

667
00:45:27,684 --> 00:45:29,895
I'm glad you got out.

668
00:45:33,941 --> 00:45:35,525
How did you get out?

669
00:45:39,196 --> 00:45:41,073
I didn't.

670
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:45,494
You look good.

671
00:45:46,036 --> 00:45:47,329
A little rough around the edges,

672
00:45:47,746 --> 00:45:49,247
but good.

673
00:45:49,748 --> 00:45:51,041
You too.

674
00:45:51,625 --> 00:45:52,793
Thank you, Ottilie.

675
00:45:53,794 --> 00:45:55,253
Have you been attentive to Dok-Ondar?

676
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,505
Very.

677
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:01,718
What should we drink to?

678
00:46:02,511 --> 00:46:05,347
Let's drink two and see where it goes.

679
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:15,941
Did you ever get that ship
we were going to fly away on?

680
00:46:16,108 --> 00:46:18,026
Yeah. Sort of.

681
00:46:18,193 --> 00:46:20,237
About to. That's why I'm here.

682
00:46:20,404 --> 00:46:22,614
I'm working on a...

683
00:46:22,781 --> 00:46:24,533
Very big deal.

684
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:25,951
How big?

685
00:46:26,034 --> 00:46:27,035
Enormous.

686
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:30,414
Really? And when are you going
to close this enormous deal?

687
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:32,165
Any minute.

688
00:46:33,667 --> 00:46:35,752
I thought about you a lot.

689
00:46:35,919 --> 00:46:39,172
Off somewhere, some adventure.

690
00:46:39,339 --> 00:46:42,759
I imagined myself with you.
It always made me...

691
00:46:45,387 --> 00:46:46,930
- What?
- Hey.

692
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,348
What did I say?

693
00:46:49,266 --> 00:46:51,435
Look, I can't keep my eyes
down the whole time.

694
00:46:51,601 --> 00:46:52,853
I'm gonna bump into something.

695
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:54,062
But I told you not to talk to anyone.

696
00:46:54,146 --> 00:46:55,147
Beckett.

697
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:59,192
Wait. You two work together?

698
00:47:00,235 --> 00:47:01,737
- Yeah.
- Tobias!

699
00:47:03,447 --> 00:47:04,823
Dryden.

700
00:47:05,032 --> 00:47:07,159
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

701
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:09,202
No, I'm fine.

702
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,705
I'm sorry to hear about Val.

703
00:47:11,872 --> 00:47:12,914
Yeah, I appreciate that.

704
00:47:13,081 --> 00:47:14,583
But there was no way
we could've anticipated...

705
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:17,169
I don't believe we've been introduced.

706
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:20,213
Yeah. This is Han Solo and Chewbacca.

707
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:21,798
They're with me.

708
00:47:21,965 --> 00:47:23,592
I'm Dryden Vos.

709
00:47:23,759 --> 00:47:27,137
I see you've already met my top lieutenant.

710
00:47:29,806 --> 00:47:31,892
Han and I grew up together on Corellia.

711
00:47:32,684 --> 00:47:34,102
Oh, fellow scrumrat.

712
00:47:35,145 --> 00:47:38,190
I admire anyone who can crawl
their way out of the sewer.

713
00:47:38,732 --> 00:47:41,276
Especially, a sewer as putrid as Corellia.

714
00:47:41,485 --> 00:47:43,779
The stench, am I right?

715
00:47:44,863 --> 00:47:45,989
Well, it's good to have you.

716
00:47:46,198 --> 00:47:47,824
Welcome.

717
00:47:47,991 --> 00:47:50,243
And you, too, Chewbacca, welcome.

718
00:47:51,453 --> 00:47:54,956
All right, let's eat a little, drink a lot,

719
00:47:55,123 --> 00:47:56,750
and talk privately.

720
00:47:59,544 --> 00:48:01,338
We're just friends, all right?

721
00:48:01,421 --> 00:48:03,423
You're touchy.

722
00:48:04,049 --> 00:48:07,469
Beckett, you have put me
in a terrible position.

723
00:48:07,636 --> 00:48:09,596
I know, Dryden, and I am sorry.

724
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:10,722
You're sorry?

725
00:48:10,806 --> 00:48:11,807
Dryden, there were complications.

726
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:12,891
There were factors.

727
00:48:12,974 --> 00:48:16,311
Enfys Nest has been
a constant irritation forever.

728
00:48:16,478 --> 00:48:19,648
It's one you should've anticipated,
it's one you should've dealt with.

729
00:48:19,815 --> 00:48:22,943
Trust me, I know I made a mistake,
but when you hired me, you told me

730
00:48:23,026 --> 00:48:24,736
no one else had this information...

731
00:48:24,903 --> 00:48:26,696
Test me!

732
00:48:27,489 --> 00:48:30,283
Test me one more time,
you'll see what happens.

733
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:32,577
I think what Dryden is trying to say

734
00:48:32,744 --> 00:48:35,413
is that we're not interested
in why you don't have it.

735
00:48:35,914 --> 00:48:37,707
No, I'm not interested.

736
00:48:37,874 --> 00:48:39,501
I'm not interested at all.

737
00:48:39,668 --> 00:48:40,669
Dryden,

738
00:48:40,961 --> 00:48:43,130
what can I do to make this right?

739
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:44,923
"Make this right?"

740
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:47,342
There is no making this right.

741
00:48:47,509 --> 00:48:48,760
You know who I answer to

742
00:48:48,927 --> 00:48:50,971
and you know what he'll expect of me.

743
00:48:51,138 --> 00:48:53,890
He'll say, "There have to be consequences."

744
00:48:54,057 --> 00:48:56,560
So here's what I need you to do for me.

745
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:00,605
I need you to give me a reason

746
00:49:00,772 --> 00:49:03,525
not to kill you all.

747
00:49:03,692 --> 00:49:05,777
Because I will make it up to you.

748
00:49:05,861 --> 00:49:06,945
No, no, no. How?

749
00:49:07,112 --> 00:49:08,780
How will you make it up to me?

750
00:49:08,947 --> 00:49:11,825
By delivering exactly what was promised.

751
00:49:12,367 --> 00:49:15,328
100 k-grams of refined coaxium?

752
00:49:15,495 --> 00:49:18,748
Yes. We will simply steal it
from somewhere else.

753
00:49:18,915 --> 00:49:20,208
From where?

754
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:22,961
You'll be hard pushed to find that
anywhere outside an Imperial vault.

755
00:49:23,128 --> 00:49:25,005
Scarif. Maybe Mercy Island.

756
00:49:25,172 --> 00:49:26,464
That's impossible.

757
00:49:26,631 --> 00:49:29,009
So, let's come up with some other options.

758
00:49:29,176 --> 00:49:30,427
Other ideas that we might...

759
00:49:30,594 --> 00:49:32,512
What about unrefined?

760
00:49:35,807 --> 00:49:38,685
Well, the only known source
of astatic coaxium

761
00:49:38,852 --> 00:49:41,479
is a fissure vent beneath
the spice mines on Kessel.

762
00:49:41,646 --> 00:49:43,773
Yeah. That's the one I was thinking of.

763
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:45,650
That's a very, very good one.

764
00:49:45,817 --> 00:49:48,111
But see, the Pykes control Kessel.

765
00:49:48,612 --> 00:49:49,613
Crimson Dawn maintains

766
00:49:49,696 --> 00:49:51,156
a fragile alliance with the Pykes.

767
00:49:51,323 --> 00:49:53,533
It's one that I can't jeopardize

768
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,911
without risking an all-out
war with the Syndicates,

769
00:49:56,077 --> 00:49:58,955
and that, gentlemen, I will not do.

770
00:49:59,122 --> 00:50:02,626
So, if that's all you have,
I think we're done here.

771
00:50:02,751 --> 00:50:03,793
Not all we have.

772
00:50:03,877 --> 00:50:06,379
We don't have any alliance with the Pykes.

773
00:50:06,546 --> 00:50:09,216
Right, so nobody is gonna know
we're working for you.

774
00:50:18,808 --> 00:50:19,809
Possible?

775
00:50:20,477 --> 00:50:21,728
It's risky.

776
00:50:21,895 --> 00:50:24,105
As soon as the raw coaxium
is removed from the vault,

777
00:50:24,272 --> 00:50:25,815
it starts to destabilize,

778
00:50:25,982 --> 00:50:27,651
so unless...

779
00:50:27,817 --> 00:50:29,236
Unless...

780
00:50:29,402 --> 00:50:30,654
Unless...

781
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:32,530
Work with me here.

782
00:50:32,697 --> 00:50:34,366
Unless you could find somewhere

783
00:50:34,449 --> 00:50:36,034
to get it processed fast.

784
00:50:36,284 --> 00:50:37,410
- Uh...
- Uh...

785
00:50:38,203 --> 00:50:39,913
Well...

786
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:41,665
He's saying Savareen?

787
00:50:41,831 --> 00:50:43,291
Savareen.

788
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:45,460
Yeah, it's an old refinery there

789
00:50:45,627 --> 00:50:47,254
and it's not under Imperial jurisdiction.

790
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:48,463
But Qi'ra's right.

791
00:50:49,089 --> 00:50:52,050
The canisters will explode
before you get there,

792
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:55,178
so you'd need an incredibly fast ship

793
00:50:55,262 --> 00:50:56,596
and a brilliant pilot.

794
00:50:56,805 --> 00:50:58,223
We'll find a ship.

795
00:50:58,390 --> 00:51:00,141
We've already got the pilot.

796
00:51:04,729 --> 00:51:07,983
He is arrogant and he's hungry.

797
00:51:08,525 --> 00:51:10,277
So what do you think, my dear?

798
00:51:10,443 --> 00:51:14,948
You think your friend here
can do what needs to be done?

799
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:23,039
Yes, I believe he can.

800
00:51:24,416 --> 00:51:25,959
Well, that is good news,

801
00:51:26,042 --> 00:51:27,627
because you're going with him

802
00:51:28,086 --> 00:51:30,547
to see that he does.

803
00:51:31,631 --> 00:51:33,508
All right?

804
00:51:34,718 --> 00:51:35,927
Of course.

805
00:51:37,429 --> 00:51:38,847
All right.

806
00:51:39,014 --> 00:51:40,390
I'll see you all on Savareen.

807
00:51:40,557 --> 00:51:41,641
Savareen it is.

808
00:51:41,808 --> 00:51:43,435
- I feel great about this plan.
- Me, too.

809
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:45,228
We should do this again. It's been fun.

810
00:51:45,645 --> 00:51:46,646
Great.

811
00:51:46,813 --> 00:51:48,148
Oh, just one more thing.

812
00:51:48,315 --> 00:51:50,275
If you do fail me again,

813
00:51:52,027 --> 00:51:53,653
we'll all be out of options.

814
00:51:53,945 --> 00:51:54,946
Right?

815
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:56,323
We won't.

816
00:51:59,367 --> 00:52:01,286
So, I thought that went really well.

817
00:52:02,329 --> 00:52:04,581
Let's get this done as quick
and as clean as possible.

818
00:52:04,664 --> 00:52:05,665
What do you need?

819
00:52:05,749 --> 00:52:07,083
I can scrounge up the gear.

820
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:08,543
Do you got a line on a ship?

821
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:09,961
I know a guy.

822
00:52:11,171 --> 00:52:12,922
And I know just where to find him.

823
00:52:13,673 --> 00:52:15,675
It's a long shot, but it's worth a try.

824
00:52:15,842 --> 00:52:17,010
He's the best smuggler around.

825
00:52:17,177 --> 00:52:20,347
He's slipped through the Empire's fingers
more times than anyone else.

826
00:52:20,847 --> 00:52:23,016
He's attractive, too.

827
00:52:23,183 --> 00:52:24,225
Sophisticated,

828
00:52:24,392 --> 00:52:28,396
with impeccable taste and... Charisma.

829
00:52:29,814 --> 00:52:31,775
Not to mention his prodigious...

830
00:52:31,941 --> 00:52:32,942
We get it.

831
00:52:37,906 --> 00:52:40,784
But he's retired. Says he's a sportsman now.

832
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:42,577
All we need is his ship.

833
00:52:42,744 --> 00:52:44,245
Well, he'll never part with it.

834
00:52:44,412 --> 00:52:45,580
He loves that ship.

835
00:52:45,747 --> 00:52:47,248
He won it

836
00:52:47,916 --> 00:52:49,084
playing Sabacc.

837
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:50,168
And there's the rub, right?

838
00:52:50,251 --> 00:52:52,087
How was I supposed to know
she was an Imperial spy?

839
00:52:52,253 --> 00:52:54,589
I thought she loved me.

840
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:56,091
That's the guy, huh?

841
00:52:56,174 --> 00:52:57,342
Hmm.

842
00:52:57,759 --> 00:52:59,219
An interesting style.

843
00:52:59,386 --> 00:53:00,387
I'll say.

844
00:53:01,471 --> 00:53:02,806
You say he won his ship?

845
00:53:02,972 --> 00:53:04,599
You have an awful Sabacc face.
I'm gonna call it.

846
00:53:04,766 --> 00:53:05,975
I can take him. Let me at him.

847
00:53:06,142 --> 00:53:07,477
Absolutely not.

848
00:53:07,644 --> 00:53:09,896
Han, these guys are serious gamblers.

849
00:53:10,063 --> 00:53:11,731
I'm serious. Stake me.

850
00:53:12,357 --> 00:53:14,442
Don't listen to him.

851
00:53:20,949 --> 00:53:22,867
Thank you. Thank you.

852
00:53:23,034 --> 00:53:24,702
You see, how'd you guys
let me beat you on that one?

853
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:26,079
Come on.

854
00:53:27,163 --> 00:53:29,040
There's no liars in this game, just players.

855
00:53:29,207 --> 00:53:31,084
Is this seat taken?

856
00:53:33,753 --> 00:53:36,214
If nobody's in the seat,
then it ain't taken, friend.

857
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,928
So this is, uh, Sabacc?

858
00:53:42,011 --> 00:53:43,012
Sabacc.

859
00:53:43,096 --> 00:53:45,390
Sabacc. Got it.

860
00:53:45,557 --> 00:53:46,558
You play it before?

861
00:53:46,975 --> 00:53:48,351
A couple times, yeah.

862
00:53:50,228 --> 00:53:51,396
Captain Lando Calrissian.

863
00:53:51,563 --> 00:53:52,564
Han Solo.

864
00:53:53,398 --> 00:53:55,191
Looks like you're having a good day.

865
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:56,401
I'm a lucky guy.

866
00:53:57,735 --> 00:54:00,405
Can I ask you a question, Captain Calrissian?

867
00:54:00,572 --> 00:54:01,823
Anything, Han.

868
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:04,951
That's "Han", but that's okay.

869
00:54:05,618 --> 00:54:09,456
I heard a story about you.
I was wondering if it's true.

870
00:54:10,707 --> 00:54:14,002
Everything you've heard about me is true.

871
00:54:14,085 --> 00:54:15,170
Thanks, love.

872
00:54:15,253 --> 00:54:17,172
Did you win your ship playing cards?

873
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:19,716
Oh, I've won a lot of things.

874
00:54:20,717 --> 00:54:23,803
I once won a subtropical moon
in the Oseon Belt.

875
00:54:24,012 --> 00:54:25,263
Wow.

876
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:26,848
Turned out to be a real money pit.

877
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:27,932
I'm impressed.

878
00:54:28,016 --> 00:54:31,060
I don't think I'd have the nerve to gamble
with something I love as much as my ship.

879
00:54:31,227 --> 00:54:32,854
- Really?
- Yeah.

880
00:54:33,021 --> 00:54:34,063
What do you fly?

881
00:54:34,981 --> 00:54:36,774
VCX-100.

882
00:54:38,276 --> 00:54:40,320
That is a quality ship. Right, boys?

883
00:54:40,487 --> 00:54:43,781
It's the fastest in the galaxy,
but there's a lot of great ships out there.

884
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:45,825
I mean, I'm sure yours is very nice.

885
00:54:45,992 --> 00:54:47,869
Gets me where I'm goin'.

886
00:54:52,373 --> 00:54:53,500
Beginner's luck.

887
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:55,460
Well played.

888
00:55:02,926 --> 00:55:04,802
Let's see what we got here.

889
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:06,137
Oh, great hand!

890
00:55:10,433 --> 00:55:13,394
Sorry, guys. Close, but not quite.

891
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,989
Eyes on your own cards, buddy.

892
00:55:25,698 --> 00:55:27,283
All of 'em.

893
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:28,993
There. Well, now I see yours.

894
00:55:34,374 --> 00:55:38,795
Oh, that's me? Okay, let's see...

895
00:55:41,256 --> 00:55:43,049
Sorry, minus two.

896
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:49,097
This game is fun.

897
00:55:49,681 --> 00:55:51,099
All right, how about this?

898
00:55:51,766 --> 00:55:54,602
I'll see your bet and I'll raise you.

899
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:57,981
2,000.

900
00:56:01,734 --> 00:56:03,111
I'll see your 2,000

901
00:56:03,695 --> 00:56:05,697
and I'll raise you

902
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:08,199
however much this is.

903
00:56:10,785 --> 00:56:12,412
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Han.

904
00:56:12,579 --> 00:56:13,955
Slow down.

905
00:56:14,122 --> 00:56:15,331
You might wanna quit while you're ahead.

906
00:56:15,665 --> 00:56:17,875
You might wanna quit while you're behind.

907
00:56:19,961 --> 00:56:21,629
I like this kid.

908
00:56:21,713 --> 00:56:22,755
You're adorable.

909
00:56:22,839 --> 00:56:23,965
And I'm serious.

910
00:56:24,465 --> 00:56:25,800
And I'm calling.

911
00:56:26,217 --> 00:56:27,302
With what?

912
00:56:27,468 --> 00:56:28,553
Your scarf?

913
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:29,804
Not my style.

914
00:56:29,971 --> 00:56:31,306
My ship.

915
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:33,975
Against your ship.

916
00:56:35,768 --> 00:56:37,812
Time to find out if you got the nerve.

917
00:56:40,648 --> 00:56:41,899
What the hell?

918
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:47,071
Straight Staves.

919
00:56:57,290 --> 00:56:59,459
You played me. You're good.

920
00:56:59,626 --> 00:57:01,419
- Yeah.
- You're very good.

921
00:57:01,586 --> 00:57:03,212
But not good enough.

922
00:57:03,379 --> 00:57:04,756
Full Sabacc.

923
00:57:11,387 --> 00:57:13,389
I told you to quit while you were ahead.

924
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:17,101
Drinks on me!

925
00:57:21,314 --> 00:57:22,690
Yeah, that's right.

926
00:57:30,073 --> 00:57:32,742
First of all, there's no way
he could've had that green sylop.

927
00:57:32,909 --> 00:57:34,035
They'd all been played.

928
00:57:34,202 --> 00:57:35,662
Also, your guy, Captain Wonderful,

929
00:57:35,745 --> 00:57:36,954
is so full of bantha crap...

930
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:38,873
Yoo-hoo!

931
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:42,543
Where's my VCX?

932
00:57:43,419 --> 00:57:44,671
I don't have it right here now.

933
00:57:44,754 --> 00:57:46,005
It's in the shop.

934
00:57:46,172 --> 00:57:48,341
- I'm getting some work done.
- Lando.

935
00:57:49,676 --> 00:57:51,135
Qi'ra.

936
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:55,181
You look phenomenal. As always.

937
00:57:55,348 --> 00:57:57,225
Well, I knew I was gonna see you.

938
00:57:57,850 --> 00:57:58,893
Get off!

939
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:00,269
What are you doing with hairy and the boy?

940
00:58:00,436 --> 00:58:02,563
- There's no need, none.
- They work for me.

941
00:58:02,939 --> 00:58:04,273
Good help is hard to find, no?

942
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:05,983
We're more like partners.

943
00:58:06,693 --> 00:58:07,985
We are.

944
00:58:08,069 --> 00:58:09,070
Excuse us.

945
00:58:10,154 --> 00:58:13,199
Listen, last I checked, me and
Crimson Dawn, we're squared away.

946
00:58:13,366 --> 00:58:17,203
Dryden said all is forgiven after
I did the whole Felucia thing for him.

947
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:20,373
Yeah. New move, we're making the Kessel Run.

948
00:58:21,749 --> 00:58:22,917
We need a ship.

949
00:58:23,084 --> 00:58:24,252
Why didn't you just say so?

950
00:58:24,419 --> 00:58:25,712
I thought you were retired.

951
00:58:26,879 --> 00:58:28,798
Circumstances change.

952
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:30,758
How much?

953
00:58:30,925 --> 00:58:32,343
The Kessel Run.

954
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:35,138
That's no easy spin.
I'm gonna need half the take.

955
00:58:35,304 --> 00:58:37,014
Ridiculous.

956
00:58:37,098 --> 00:58:38,766
Grown-ups are talking.

957
00:58:38,933 --> 00:58:40,351
25%.

958
00:58:45,606 --> 00:58:46,941
You're Tobias Beckett.

959
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:48,818
You killed Aurra Sing.

960
00:58:50,361 --> 00:58:52,655
Pushed her. Pretty sure the fall killed her.

961
00:58:52,822 --> 00:58:55,658
You did the galaxy a favor
that day. Me, especially.

962
00:58:55,825 --> 00:58:57,034
I owed her a lot of money.

963
00:58:57,118 --> 00:58:58,786
And as token of my gratitude,

964
00:58:59,245 --> 00:59:01,539
I'm willing to do this for 40%.

965
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:06,461
25.

966
00:59:11,382 --> 00:59:13,092
25% works.

967
00:59:13,384 --> 00:59:15,678
No! Unacceptable!

968
00:59:15,845 --> 00:59:18,264
Stop exploiting droids!

969
00:59:18,431 --> 00:59:20,099
You sloppy degenerate bios!

970
00:59:20,266 --> 00:59:21,768
- She never learns.
- Have you no shame?

971
00:59:21,851 --> 00:59:22,852
Who?

972
00:59:23,019 --> 00:59:24,228
My first mate.

973
00:59:24,395 --> 00:59:26,022
You got no business being here.
Get out of here!

974
00:59:26,189 --> 00:59:29,233
How can you condone this savagery?

975
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,778
You, you. You should not be doing this.

976
00:59:31,944 --> 00:59:34,071
They're using you for entertainment.

977
00:59:34,655 --> 00:59:36,324
Yeah. You've been neurowashed.

978
00:59:36,491 --> 00:59:38,659
Don't just blindly follow the program.

979
00:59:38,826 --> 00:59:40,745
Exercise some free will!

980
00:59:41,871 --> 00:59:43,247
Stay away from him!

981
00:59:43,414 --> 00:59:44,999
He's never had it so good.

982
00:59:45,166 --> 00:59:47,668
Oh, really? How about you have
a go at me, ya lumpy brute.

983
00:59:47,835 --> 00:59:48,920
- Bring it on!
- Come on!

984
00:59:49,003 --> 00:59:50,046
L3!

985
00:59:50,129 --> 00:59:52,089
Droid rights! We are sentient!

986
00:59:52,256 --> 00:59:54,258
I'm gonna flip your switch.

987
00:59:54,967 --> 00:59:56,344
Good luck finding it.

988
00:59:56,511 --> 00:59:57,929
L3!

989
00:59:59,347 --> 01:00:01,140
Let go of the mean man's face.

990
01:00:01,307 --> 01:00:02,308
We're leaving.

991
01:00:02,475 --> 01:00:04,393
They don't even serve our kind here.

992
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:05,603
Now.

993
01:00:09,315 --> 01:00:10,650
Who are these guys?

994
01:00:10,817 --> 01:00:12,276
We're taking them to Kessel.

995
01:00:12,819 --> 01:00:14,237
Oh, are we?

996
01:00:14,403 --> 01:00:16,489
And what if I don't elect to go to Kessel?

997
01:00:16,989 --> 01:00:18,157
Please don't start.

998
01:00:18,324 --> 01:00:19,534
Or what, you'll have me wiped?

999
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:22,078
You couldn't get from here to
Black Spire without me.

1000
01:00:22,245 --> 01:00:23,788
Now you're gonna make the Kessel Run?

1001
01:00:23,955 --> 01:00:25,873
If she doesn't wanna fly,
I'll be your co-pilot.

1002
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,667
- I don't mind.
- No, no. It's okay.

1003
01:00:27,834 --> 01:00:29,085
She's definitely going.

1004
01:00:29,252 --> 01:00:32,171
Oh, why? Because you're my organic overlord?

1005
01:00:32,338 --> 01:00:34,382
Because I'm your captain, how about that?

1006
01:00:34,549 --> 01:00:36,759
I actually would have her memory wiped,

1007
01:00:36,926 --> 01:00:38,177
but she's got the best damn

1008
01:00:38,261 --> 01:00:39,929
navigational database in the galaxy.

1009
01:00:40,429 --> 01:00:42,014
Could use a fresh coat of paint, though!

1010
01:00:42,181 --> 01:00:45,476
Landonis, you do not want to
press that button with me.

1011
01:00:46,644 --> 01:00:49,272
You know, a lot of ships
around here get boosted.

1012
01:00:49,438 --> 01:00:51,482
So, I keep mine locked up.

1013
01:00:51,649 --> 01:00:53,359
You know, for safety.

1014
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:56,320
L3, do you mind?

1015
01:01:02,326 --> 01:01:03,786
Look away.

1016
01:01:03,953 --> 01:01:05,204
I can't perform with you looking at me.

1017
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,664
Please indulge her.

1018
01:01:14,964 --> 01:01:17,216
I can feel you looking at me.

1019
01:01:21,929 --> 01:01:23,598
What are we doing here?

1020
01:01:23,764 --> 01:01:24,807
This guy's a hustler.

1021
01:01:24,891 --> 01:01:26,225
I don't even think he's got a ship.

1022
01:01:26,392 --> 01:01:27,977
If he does, it's gonna be a piece of junk

1023
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:29,061
if it's even here.

1024
01:01:29,228 --> 01:01:32,023
There she is, my pride and joy.

1025
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:34,191
The <i>Millennium Falcon.</i>

1026
01:01:49,582 --> 01:01:51,709
Looks like you had a little work done.

1027
01:01:51,876 --> 01:01:53,377
Indeed I have, Han.

1028
01:01:53,544 --> 01:01:56,005
Installed an escape pod
in the mandible notch,

1029
01:01:56,172 --> 01:01:58,591
alluvial dampers, a wet bar.

1030
01:01:58,758 --> 01:02:00,593
And a fortified infraction

1031
01:02:00,676 --> 01:02:02,803
restraint on the landing gear.

1032
01:02:02,970 --> 01:02:05,932
Looks to me like they
impounded your ship, Lando.

1033
01:02:06,766 --> 01:02:08,351
This is unbelievable!

1034
01:02:08,517 --> 01:02:09,894
I'm definitely gonna have some words

1035
01:02:09,977 --> 01:02:12,021
with someone about this.

1036
01:02:13,606 --> 01:02:15,274
You must have experience with these, right?

1037
01:02:15,691 --> 01:02:17,276
Yeah, I could take it off.

1038
01:02:17,443 --> 01:02:18,569
Fantastic!

1039
01:02:18,736 --> 01:02:20,571
Along with five percent off your cut.

1040
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:23,074
You're down to 20.

1041
01:02:25,743 --> 01:02:27,495
I don't like it.

1042
01:02:27,662 --> 01:02:29,288
I don't agree with it.

1043
01:02:30,289 --> 01:02:31,499
But I accept it.

1044
01:02:32,833 --> 01:02:34,710
You're getting the hang of this, Lando.

1045
01:02:35,294 --> 01:02:36,504
Yeah.

1046
01:02:36,837 --> 01:02:37,880
Come on, Chewie.

1047
01:02:38,047 --> 01:02:39,048
Gonna need a little bit of

1048
01:02:39,131 --> 01:02:40,549
that Wookiee oomph.

1049
01:02:42,343 --> 01:02:43,844
<i>Your plan is underway, Enfys.</i>

1050
01:02:43,928 --> 01:02:45,888
<i>We've attached the homing beacon.</i>

1051
01:02:46,055 --> 01:02:47,223
<i>They won't elude us now.</i>

1052
01:02:47,306 --> 01:02:48,307
<i>Good.</i>

1053
01:02:53,771 --> 01:02:57,233
<i>If they survive,
they'll bring the prize to us.</i>

1054
01:03:12,581 --> 01:03:14,959
This is a Corellian YT-1300.

1055
01:03:15,543 --> 01:03:17,920
Oh. You know your stuff.

1056
01:03:18,087 --> 01:03:19,672
I've been on one before.

1057
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:21,173
My dad worked the line

1058
01:03:21,257 --> 01:03:23,968
at the CEC plant before he got laid off.

1059
01:03:24,427 --> 01:03:25,803
He built these.

1060
01:03:26,971 --> 01:03:29,348
He wanted to be a pilot, but...

1061
01:03:29,515 --> 01:03:31,726
You, uh, close with your old man?

1062
01:03:32,476 --> 01:03:33,519
Not really.

1063
01:03:33,686 --> 01:03:35,813
Yeah, me neither.

1064
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:37,940
My mom, on the other hand,

1065
01:03:38,107 --> 01:03:40,109
most amazing woman I've ever known.

1066
01:03:43,487 --> 01:03:44,572
Excuse me.

1067
01:03:44,739 --> 01:03:47,450
Get your presumptuous ass out of my seat!

1068
01:03:53,122 --> 01:03:55,958
My sacral-occipital circuit is sticking.

1069
01:03:56,125 --> 01:03:57,710
You're gonna have
to do that thing again later.

1070
01:03:58,419 --> 01:03:59,670
Yeah.

1071
01:04:00,087 --> 01:04:02,089
All right, course to Kessel is set.

1072
01:04:02,256 --> 01:04:03,841
Plugging coordinates in now.

1073
01:04:04,008 --> 01:04:05,259
Just keep your pinky on the yoke

1074
01:04:05,426 --> 01:04:06,635
and try not to mess anything up.

1075
01:04:06,802 --> 01:04:07,803
Whatever you say, my lady.

1076
01:04:07,887 --> 01:04:09,472
Just let me know when you're ready to jump.

1077
01:04:09,638 --> 01:04:11,348
Ready in...

1078
01:04:13,392 --> 01:04:14,393
Ready.

1079
01:04:15,686 --> 01:04:18,147
It's just a simple jump to
hyperspace, and we're there.

1080
01:04:18,314 --> 01:04:19,440
What's so tricky about that?

1081
01:04:19,607 --> 01:04:21,734
Plenty. Can't plot a direct course to Kessel.

1082
01:04:21,901 --> 01:04:23,694
You have to thread through
the Si'Klaata Cluster

1083
01:04:23,861 --> 01:04:25,780
and then pass through The Maelstrom.

1084
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:28,240
You done flirting? I'm still ready.

1085
01:04:29,408 --> 01:04:31,285
You might wanna buckle up, baby.

1086
01:04:51,847 --> 01:04:52,932
Think.

1087
01:04:53,099 --> 01:04:54,683
Do you wanna make that move?

1088
01:04:54,850 --> 01:04:56,811
Do you wanna make that move?

1089
01:04:57,228 --> 01:04:59,105
You made that move, okay.

1090
01:04:59,271 --> 01:05:01,899
I guess I have to destroy that little guy.

1091
01:05:02,066 --> 01:05:04,318
Somehow I never get bored with winning.

1092
01:05:05,653 --> 01:05:08,322
No, you can't wipe 'em off.
They're holograms.

1093
01:05:09,573 --> 01:05:11,367
Hey, hey, hey! Chewie, relax!

1094
01:05:11,534 --> 01:05:13,661
Hey, try to compose yourself.

1095
01:05:13,828 --> 01:05:15,746
Look. All you gotta do is
think a few moves ahead,

1096
01:05:15,913 --> 01:05:17,081
anticipate your opponent.

1097
01:05:17,248 --> 01:05:19,792
There's a lesson to be learned here.

1098
01:05:19,959 --> 01:05:21,001
Uh, you guys seen Qi'ra?

1099
01:05:23,629 --> 01:05:25,464
People are predictable.

1100
01:05:47,278 --> 01:05:49,363
Yeah, I had to try one on.

1101
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:50,990
That's a lot of capes.

1102
01:05:51,157 --> 01:05:52,950
Maybe too many capes.

1103
01:05:57,580 --> 01:05:58,831
So what's the plan?

1104
01:05:59,248 --> 01:06:01,584
Well, I thought we'd talk
a little first and then you know...

1105
01:06:02,626 --> 01:06:04,295
- For Kessel.
- Oh.

1106
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:06,130
- Mmm-hmm.
- Good.

1107
01:06:06,297 --> 01:06:08,007
Yeah? How good?

1108
01:06:08,174 --> 01:06:09,175
Foolproof.

1109
01:06:09,341 --> 01:06:10,843
Well, it better be.

1110
01:06:10,926 --> 01:06:11,927
- I...
- I...

1111
01:06:12,011 --> 01:06:13,095
- You go first.
- No.

1112
01:06:13,262 --> 01:06:14,597
What were you gonna say?

1113
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:17,683
I wanna tell you so much.

1114
01:06:18,434 --> 01:06:19,894
And I wanna know everything

1115
01:06:19,977 --> 01:06:21,812
that's happened to you since Corellia.

1116
01:06:23,105 --> 01:06:25,524
I'm not sure we have that kinda time.

1117
01:06:25,691 --> 01:06:26,817
We could.

1118
01:06:26,984 --> 01:06:29,236
We could have all the time
we want after the job.

1119
01:06:29,403 --> 01:06:30,905
You and I.

1120
01:06:31,071 --> 01:06:32,072
What?

1121
01:06:33,157 --> 01:06:34,491
I want to.

1122
01:06:35,201 --> 01:06:36,410
You want to?

1123
01:06:36,577 --> 01:06:38,871
To tell you everything that's happened.

1124
01:06:40,372 --> 01:06:42,499
But I know if I do,
you won't look at me the same.

1125
01:06:42,875 --> 01:06:44,627
The way that you're looking at me right now.

1126
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:46,837
Nothing is gonna change the way
I'm looking at you right now.

1127
01:06:46,921 --> 01:06:49,131
You don't know that.
You don't know what I've done.

1128
01:07:03,187 --> 01:07:04,730
Am I interrupting something?

1129
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:08,108
Kinda.

1130
01:07:08,901 --> 01:07:09,902
Good.

1131
01:07:10,069 --> 01:07:11,737
'Cause we got a lot of work to do.

1132
01:07:12,404 --> 01:07:14,230
- You're making a big mistake.
- Oh, really?

1133
01:07:14,311 --> 01:07:17,243
Which is yours to make except when you
start to interfere with my livelihood.

1134
01:07:17,326 --> 01:07:18,327
This isn't gonna interfere
with your livelihood.

1135
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:19,411
Then we have a problem.

1136
01:07:19,495 --> 01:07:21,914
You don't see it, because you don't want to.

1137
01:07:22,081 --> 01:07:23,707
Maybe I know her a little better than you do.

1138
01:07:23,874 --> 01:07:26,335
Maybe you don't know her well enough.

1139
01:07:27,044 --> 01:07:28,087
All right?

1140
01:07:28,170 --> 01:07:29,588
Look.

1141
01:07:30,089 --> 01:07:31,548
I like you, kid.

1142
01:07:31,715 --> 01:07:34,260
We got a good thing going
here. Me, you, Chewie.

1143
01:07:34,343 --> 01:07:35,344
- Yeah.
- Right?

1144
01:07:35,427 --> 01:07:37,179
The makings of a solid crew.

1145
01:07:37,346 --> 01:07:39,348
But it does not work with Qi'ra.

1146
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:42,142
It worked with Val. You trusted her.

1147
01:07:44,103 --> 01:07:46,981
You wanna know how I've
survived as long as I have?

1148
01:07:47,648 --> 01:07:49,024
I trust no one.

1149
01:07:50,484 --> 01:07:52,945
Assume everyone will betray you

1150
01:07:53,028 --> 01:07:54,947
and you will never be disappointed.

1151
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,409
Sounds like a lonely way to live.

1152
01:07:59,034 --> 01:08:01,078
It's the only way.

1153
01:08:08,002 --> 01:08:09,128
Dropping out of lightspeed now.

1154
01:08:09,295 --> 01:08:10,337
Ready to...

1155
01:08:15,926 --> 01:08:18,095
The Akkadese Maelstrom.

1156
01:08:19,888 --> 01:08:21,265
I'm gonna go check on the dampers.

1157
01:08:21,348 --> 01:08:22,349
You need anything?

1158
01:08:22,516 --> 01:08:24,059
Equal rights?

1159
01:08:54,214 --> 01:08:55,341
What's that sound?

1160
01:08:55,507 --> 01:08:58,761
Carbonbergs, size of planets,
crashing into each other.

1161
01:08:58,927 --> 01:09:00,888
Ships fly in there, they never come out.

1162
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:02,931
It's ionized gas, water vapor,

1163
01:09:03,098 --> 01:09:04,850
possibly vacuum-breathing life forms

1164
01:09:04,933 --> 01:09:06,226
swirling around The Maw.

1165
01:09:06,393 --> 01:09:07,978
Only way in or out is this channel.

1166
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:12,232
So what are you gonna do
about your little problem?

1167
01:09:12,608 --> 01:09:13,734
Problem?

1168
01:09:14,151 --> 01:09:15,152
Uh...

1169
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:16,779
Well, that brand on your wrist

1170
01:09:16,862 --> 01:09:18,072
tells me that you're committed.

1171
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:20,699
And that young male's heart fluctuations

1172
01:09:20,783 --> 01:09:22,034
tell me he's in love with you.

1173
01:09:22,201 --> 01:09:24,495
Han is not in love with me!

1174
01:09:26,038 --> 01:09:27,915
Oh, please. It's just us.

1175
01:09:28,082 --> 01:09:31,335
You don't have to pretend.
I'm in the same situation.

1176
01:09:31,418 --> 01:09:32,419
You are?

1177
01:09:32,503 --> 01:09:33,545
I'm sure you've noticed

1178
01:09:33,712 --> 01:09:34,922
that Lando has feelings for me.

1179
01:09:35,005 --> 01:09:36,548
Which makes working together difficult

1180
01:09:36,715 --> 01:09:38,884
because I do not feel the same way about him.

1181
01:09:39,051 --> 01:09:40,302
Right.

1182
01:09:40,469 --> 01:09:41,970
Yes, yeah.

1183
01:09:42,137 --> 01:09:43,555
Yeah, I see that.

1184
01:09:43,722 --> 01:09:46,517
Sometimes, I think... Maybe.

1185
01:09:47,309 --> 01:09:48,644
But, no.

1186
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:52,272
We're just not compatible.

1187
01:09:54,191 --> 01:09:55,943
How would that work?

1188
01:09:56,443 --> 01:09:57,444
It works.

1189
01:10:07,955 --> 01:10:09,748
This is a precision job.

1190
01:10:09,915 --> 01:10:12,376
Thermal vault will be on the lowest level.

1191
01:10:12,459 --> 01:10:13,836
Down where it's warm.

1192
01:10:14,002 --> 01:10:15,629
The only way we're gonna pull this off

1193
01:10:15,796 --> 01:10:18,257
is if everybody plays their part.

1194
01:10:18,424 --> 01:10:20,217
Stick to the plan.

1195
01:10:20,384 --> 01:10:22,719
Do not improvise.

1196
01:10:27,266 --> 01:10:29,435
Mining colonies are the worst.

1197
01:10:29,601 --> 01:10:31,437
Yeah, well, "the worst"

1198
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:32,896
is where the money is.

1199
01:10:35,023 --> 01:10:37,151
All right, people. Time to shine.

1200
01:11:13,687 --> 01:11:15,314
It won't be for long.

1201
01:11:15,481 --> 01:11:17,149
Shut up, the both of you.

1202
01:11:17,441 --> 01:11:19,526
I am Oksana Floren,

1203
01:11:19,693 --> 01:11:21,695
Deputy Assistant Administrator
to the Vice-Admiral

1204
01:11:21,862 --> 01:11:24,573
of the Federation of Trade Route Allocation

1205
01:11:24,656 --> 01:11:25,908
and Monetization.

1206
01:11:26,116 --> 01:11:29,203
Here with an offer from his eminence,

1207
01:11:29,286 --> 01:11:30,746
the Senior Vice-Admiral.

1208
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:34,208
Your spice for our hard-working slaves.

1209
01:11:34,374 --> 01:11:35,709
I brought you a sample.

1210
01:11:35,876 --> 01:11:38,545
Tuul, bring forth the merchandise.

1211
01:12:07,282 --> 01:12:08,951
Director Tolsite said our slaves

1212
01:12:09,034 --> 01:12:10,118
should follow those guys

1213
01:12:10,285 --> 01:12:11,954
to get clipped and tagged.

1214
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:13,664
What are they clipping?

1215
01:12:14,331 --> 01:12:16,625
Mmm-hmm.

1216
01:12:18,126 --> 01:12:19,127
He wants us to follow him.

1217
01:12:23,465 --> 01:12:24,466
Really?

1218
01:12:24,633 --> 01:12:27,135
That's for that stunt you pulled
earlier, you degenerate scum.

1219
01:12:46,488 --> 01:12:50,242
He says all systems in this sector
of the facility operate out of this room.

1220
01:12:50,409 --> 01:12:54,079
It's how they're able to maintain
control over so many with so few.

1221
01:12:58,208 --> 01:13:02,546
The director says their reconditioning
process is excruciating but effective.

1222
01:13:17,811 --> 01:13:20,063
He said your security attach can wait there.

1223
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:22,482
"Surely, we don't need him to negotiate."

1224
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:26,403
Wait there, Tuul.

1225
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:28,488
Try not to bother anyone.

1226
01:13:53,221 --> 01:13:54,473
Nice!

1227
01:13:54,973 --> 01:13:56,016
That was the uniform

1228
01:13:56,099 --> 01:13:58,393
that would've fit me
perfectly, but it's fine.

1229
01:14:04,024 --> 01:14:05,067
What is it?

1230
01:14:08,111 --> 01:14:09,905
Would you mind holding this for me?

1231
01:14:24,336 --> 01:14:25,379
Whoa.

1232
01:14:25,462 --> 01:14:27,130
I have never see anyone do...

1233
01:14:27,297 --> 01:14:28,382
What was that?

1234
01:14:28,715 --> 01:14:30,759
Ters Ksi.

1235
01:14:32,010 --> 01:14:33,011
Dryden taught me.

1236
01:14:38,308 --> 01:14:39,351
Ah.

1237
01:14:39,434 --> 01:14:40,519
Well negotiated.

1238
01:14:50,821 --> 01:14:52,656
Excuse me. I need to use this terminal.

1239
01:14:52,739 --> 01:14:53,740
Hello?

1240
01:14:55,117 --> 01:14:56,868
Can you hear me? Ugh.

1241
01:14:58,120 --> 01:14:59,538
Restraining bolts...

1242
01:14:59,871 --> 01:15:00,914
Barbaric.

1243
01:15:03,125 --> 01:15:05,127
Congratulations! You're liberated. Scoot.

1244
01:15:05,210 --> 01:15:06,211
I don't know.

1245
01:15:06,294 --> 01:15:07,295
Free your brothers and sisters or something.

1246
01:15:07,462 --> 01:15:09,423
Just give me some space.

1247
01:15:15,178 --> 01:15:16,388
I'm in!

1248
01:15:16,555 --> 01:15:17,639
<i>Han, can you hear me?</i>

1249
01:15:17,806 --> 01:15:18,932
I kinda need to know which way to go here.

1250
01:15:19,182 --> 01:15:20,183
L3?

1251
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:23,729
The thermal vault is down two levels, then
left, then right, then it's the third left.

1252
01:15:23,895 --> 01:15:27,107
Right. That's a lot of
directions, but we're on it.

1253
01:15:34,156 --> 01:15:35,323
They're in subsector four,

1254
01:15:35,490 --> 01:15:37,784
coming up on gate X-3-7-1-K.

1255
01:15:37,951 --> 01:15:39,161
Overriding!

1256
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:46,626
Freedom.

1257
01:16:08,774 --> 01:16:10,901
What the hell are you guys doing up there?

1258
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:12,986
I created a distraction!

1259
01:16:18,033 --> 01:16:19,034
Come on! This way!

1260
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:23,789
Wait! What are you doing?

1261
01:16:24,247 --> 01:16:25,791
Come on, we gotta get the coaxium.

1262
01:16:27,876 --> 01:16:30,170
Hey! Remember what Beckett
said, stick to the plan.

1263
01:16:30,378 --> 01:16:33,340
Chewie! Come on, let's go!

1264
01:16:36,510 --> 01:16:37,511
Fine!

1265
01:16:39,721 --> 01:16:40,806
Chewie!

1266
01:16:43,558 --> 01:16:44,976
Here, you might need this.

1267
01:16:50,232 --> 01:16:52,234
Hope I see you around sometime.

1268
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:09,292
Han, where are you?

1269
01:17:09,459 --> 01:17:10,919
<i>I'm on my way to the vault.</i>

1270
01:17:11,086 --> 01:17:12,337
<i>I lost Chewie.</i>

1271
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:13,421
He's dead?

1272
01:17:13,588 --> 01:17:15,048
No, he had something he had to do.

1273
01:17:15,215 --> 01:17:16,341
<i>Is he coming back?</i>

1274
01:17:16,508 --> 01:17:17,551
I don't know.

1275
01:17:18,927 --> 01:17:20,804
Okay, they're on to us now.

1276
01:17:30,605 --> 01:17:31,606
I'm at the vault.

1277
01:17:39,573 --> 01:17:41,116
That's what I said!

1278
01:17:44,536 --> 01:17:46,371
- Huh, that was impressive.
- Yeah.

1279
01:17:46,746 --> 01:17:47,831
We're clear.

1280
01:17:58,383 --> 01:17:59,509
Now what?

1281
01:17:59,676 --> 01:18:01,469
<i>Han, each canister should be equipped</i>

1282
01:18:01,553 --> 01:18:02,596
<i>with a thermal display.</i>

1283
01:18:02,762 --> 01:18:03,930
Yeah, I see it.

1284
01:18:04,097 --> 01:18:06,808
If the internal temperature
reaches below 35 standard,

1285
01:18:06,975 --> 01:18:09,978
<i>then the coaxium
will destabilize and explode.</i>

1286
01:18:10,145 --> 01:18:12,480
Yup, I get it, guys. It's dangerous.

1287
01:18:21,489 --> 01:18:22,741
Okay, got it.

1288
01:18:23,116 --> 01:18:24,868
Great. Only eleven more.

1289
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:26,202
Eleven?

1290
01:18:33,835 --> 01:18:36,796
The Calrissian Chronicles, <i>chapter five.</i>

1291
01:18:37,005 --> 01:18:38,298
<i>continued.</i>

1292
01:18:38,465 --> 01:18:40,425
Personally, I wasn't all that
impressed with the Sharu.

1293
01:18:40,592 --> 01:18:42,844
No sense of humor or style.

1294
01:18:43,011 --> 01:18:44,930
Nonetheless, there L3 and I were

1295
01:18:45,096 --> 01:18:46,806
deep in their sacred temple.

1296
01:18:46,973 --> 01:18:48,725
And that's when we saw it...

1297
01:18:51,353 --> 01:18:52,896
Always something.

1298
01:18:55,315 --> 01:18:57,025
You guys are not gonna believe
what I'm seeing up here.

1299
01:18:57,192 --> 01:18:59,069
<i>Is it a mass breakout?</i>

1300
01:18:59,694 --> 01:19:00,737
L3, what did you do?

1301
01:19:00,904 --> 01:19:02,739
I found my true purpose, Lando.

1302
01:19:02,906 --> 01:19:04,032
That's what I've done.

1303
01:19:05,909 --> 01:19:08,119
I'm so glad we took this job!

1304
01:19:08,328 --> 01:19:09,704
That droid!

1305
01:19:09,788 --> 01:19:10,789
L3, come on!

1306
01:19:13,833 --> 01:19:15,418
Follow me, compatriots!

1307
01:19:22,926 --> 01:19:24,511
Another couple guards just spotted me.

1308
01:19:24,678 --> 01:19:26,596
I don't have a free hand to take 'em out.

1309
01:19:26,763 --> 01:19:28,181
- What do I do?
- <i>Improvise.</i>

1310
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:30,308
You said never improvise!

1311
01:19:38,984 --> 01:19:40,402
Hi!

1312
01:19:40,568 --> 01:19:41,611
Don't forget that guy!

1313
01:19:57,961 --> 01:19:59,546
Good to see you, buddy!

1314
01:20:00,296 --> 01:20:02,215
Stay with me, Sagwa! Keep up!

1315
01:20:05,593 --> 01:20:06,970
Hey! I'm Chewie's friend, Han.

1316
01:20:09,723 --> 01:20:11,016
Okay.

1317
01:20:29,826 --> 01:20:30,952
They're stealing the coaxium.

1318
01:20:31,119 --> 01:20:32,120
Disable that freighter!

1319
01:20:38,209 --> 01:20:40,086
Han!

1320
01:20:42,172 --> 01:20:43,173
Hey!

1321
01:20:54,142 --> 01:20:55,143
Follow me.

1322
01:20:57,896 --> 01:20:59,439
Rebellion!

1323
01:21:10,241 --> 01:21:11,868
They're going for the landing gear!

1324
01:21:11,951 --> 01:21:13,119
We've gotta get out of here!

1325
01:21:15,205 --> 01:21:17,248
We need to keep 'em away from those cannons!

1326
01:21:25,465 --> 01:21:26,674
Catch that!

1327
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:31,346
Coaxium's stowed! Let's go!

1328
01:21:31,513 --> 01:21:32,931
Where's L3?

1329
01:21:33,098 --> 01:21:35,725
No more subjugation!

1330
01:21:40,396 --> 01:21:41,397
L3!

1331
01:21:41,564 --> 01:21:43,566
No, Lando! Get back here!

1332
01:21:46,277 --> 01:21:47,570
Lando!

1333
01:21:48,321 --> 01:21:50,532
System failure.

1334
01:21:50,698 --> 01:21:52,450
Have to reroute the sensory modulators.

1335
01:21:52,617 --> 01:21:54,327
It's all right. Save your energy.

1336
01:21:54,494 --> 01:21:55,954
I'm gonna get you outta here. All right?

1337
01:21:56,121 --> 01:21:57,956
System failure...

1338
01:22:03,086 --> 01:22:04,087
Rerouting...

1339
01:22:05,755 --> 01:22:06,798
Damn it!

1340
01:22:06,881 --> 01:22:07,882
Han!

1341
01:22:14,097 --> 01:22:15,098
Sagwa.

1342
01:22:15,265 --> 01:22:16,683
This way!

1343
01:22:17,142 --> 01:22:18,351
Come, come!

1344
01:22:28,820 --> 01:22:30,488
Chewie! Damn it!

1345
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:35,743
It's not responding.

1346
01:22:53,428 --> 01:22:55,430
What are you standing around for? Come on!

1347
01:23:00,894 --> 01:23:02,437
It's okay, you'll be fine.

1348
01:23:03,730 --> 01:23:05,773
It's not responding... Not responding...

1349
01:23:06,524 --> 01:23:07,734
Han, get us out of here.

1350
01:23:08,568 --> 01:23:09,569
It's not responding.

1351
01:23:09,736 --> 01:23:11,279
Han! Now!

1352
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:12,488
On it.

1353
01:23:40,683 --> 01:23:42,352
- Lando...
- I'm here.

1354
01:23:42,644 --> 01:23:44,103
- It's all right, L3.
- Lando...

1355
01:23:44,270 --> 01:23:45,355
- I've got you.
- This is not...

1356
01:23:45,563 --> 01:23:46,814
- It's okay, L3.
- Lando.

1357
01:23:47,273 --> 01:23:49,275
It's all right. I can fix you. I can fix you.

1358
01:23:49,734 --> 01:23:50,985
Lando.

1359
01:23:51,152 --> 01:23:53,154
What's happening to me?

1360
01:23:55,573 --> 01:23:56,991
L3?

1361
01:23:57,617 --> 01:23:58,910
L3!

1362
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:07,877
I'm sorry, girl.

1363
01:24:08,044 --> 01:24:10,046
I'm so sorry.

1364
01:24:23,518 --> 01:24:24,811
I could use a co-pilot.

1365
01:24:49,252 --> 01:24:50,670
Sorry.

1366
01:24:53,548 --> 01:24:55,717
With the cargo we're carrying,
if we don't make up some lost time

1367
01:24:55,883 --> 01:24:57,927
we're gonna be in real trouble.

1368
01:24:58,094 --> 01:24:59,595
How about that? Is that real trouble?

1369
01:25:06,269 --> 01:25:08,521
That is an Imperial blockade.

1370
01:25:08,688 --> 01:25:10,565
What's it doing here?

1371
01:25:10,732 --> 01:25:12,608
Probably heard about your little rebellion.

1372
01:25:13,818 --> 01:25:15,862
Nope. Not gonna make it.

1373
01:25:16,029 --> 01:25:17,071
We're gonna have to drop the shipment.

1374
01:25:17,238 --> 01:25:19,657
If we don't deliver, Dryden will kill us.

1375
01:25:19,824 --> 01:25:21,284
All right, trust me, I know these guys.

1376
01:25:21,367 --> 01:25:22,493
I used to be one of 'em.

1377
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:24,454
There's no way they're
gonna waste a TIE fighter

1378
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:26,622
chasing down a little rinky-dink freighter.

1379
01:25:31,044 --> 01:25:32,045
You were saying?

1380
01:25:32,211 --> 01:25:33,588
Usually, in situations like this

1381
01:25:33,755 --> 01:25:35,840
I like to turn around
in the opposite direction.

1382
01:25:45,016 --> 01:25:46,517
I'm on the ventral gun.

1383
01:25:51,689 --> 01:25:52,690
It's an easy equation.

1384
01:25:52,857 --> 01:25:56,110
We simply don't have enough time to get
to Savareen before the canisters explode!

1385
01:25:56,277 --> 01:25:57,528
Just have to find a faster route.

1386
01:25:57,695 --> 01:25:58,905
There isn't one! You can't make

1387
01:25:58,988 --> 01:26:00,531
the Kessel Run in less than 20 parsecs.

1388
01:26:00,615 --> 01:26:01,949
- Watch me.
- How?

1389
01:26:02,116 --> 01:26:03,409
Take a shortcut, through there.

1390
01:26:04,994 --> 01:26:06,245
- Into The Maelstrom?
- Mmm-hmm.

1391
01:26:07,163 --> 01:26:08,915
Spectacular way of killing
us all, I'll give you that.

1392
01:26:09,082 --> 01:26:10,708
- Can't do it without L3.
- She's gone!

1393
01:26:10,875 --> 01:26:12,210
You said yourself she's got the best

1394
01:26:12,293 --> 01:26:13,753
navigational database in the galaxy.

1395
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:16,881
If we remove her neural core,
it's possible we can download her brain

1396
01:26:16,964 --> 01:26:18,424
into the <i>Falcon's</i> navicomputer, right?

1397
01:26:18,508 --> 01:26:19,509
Could we?

1398
01:26:19,926 --> 01:26:20,927
Theoretically.

1399
01:26:21,094 --> 01:26:22,970
Only one way to find out.

1400
01:26:25,807 --> 01:26:28,184
I got a really good feeling about this.

1401
01:26:42,198 --> 01:26:43,741
Oops, that's on me.

1402
01:26:50,498 --> 01:26:51,833
Okay.

1403
01:26:54,210 --> 01:26:56,003
Beckett, you see them? They still on us?

1404
01:26:59,173 --> 01:27:00,466
<i>Beckett, did you hear me?</i>

1405
01:27:00,550 --> 01:27:01,968
<i>Are they on us?</i>

1406
01:27:02,135 --> 01:27:03,761
Like rashnold on a kalak.

1407
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,180
I don't know what that means.

1408
01:27:06,347 --> 01:27:08,141
Like a gingleson's pelt.

1409
01:27:08,808 --> 01:27:10,268
What? Are they or aren't they?

1410
01:27:10,435 --> 01:27:11,811
Yes, they're still on us!

1411
01:27:14,313 --> 01:27:15,314
Whoo!

1412
01:27:19,152 --> 01:27:23,656
This is why you never let
anyone fly your ship.

1413
01:27:23,823 --> 01:27:25,074
Come on!

1414
01:27:29,370 --> 01:27:31,914
Yeah, one just got past me.
He's right on top of us!

1415
01:27:41,424 --> 01:27:43,176
<i>Good going, Han!</i>

1416
01:27:48,848 --> 01:27:51,309
We need to divert auxiliary power
to the rear deflector shield.

1417
01:27:51,476 --> 01:27:53,811
We definitely do!

1418
01:28:01,027 --> 01:28:02,528
Since when do you know how to fly?

1419
01:28:05,198 --> 01:28:06,949
190 years old?

1420
01:28:08,868 --> 01:28:10,119
You look great!

1421
01:28:11,162 --> 01:28:12,205
Chewie, get in.

1422
01:28:12,371 --> 01:28:13,414
I'll help Lando.

1423
01:28:28,554 --> 01:28:31,057
Whoa! That's my cape!

1424
01:28:31,224 --> 01:28:32,350
Ah! That's a custom piece!

1425
01:28:40,107 --> 01:28:41,901
What? Beckett, you with us?

1426
01:28:42,068 --> 01:28:43,861
We just lost the cannon!

1427
01:28:44,487 --> 01:28:46,322
And I really hurt my thumbs.

1428
01:28:46,489 --> 01:28:48,115
<i>There's still one on us.</i>

1429
01:28:53,663 --> 01:28:55,081
Drop the landing gear.

1430
01:28:55,957 --> 01:28:58,918
When I tell you, flood the intake
and sweep to the bi-lats.

1431
01:29:02,380 --> 01:29:05,258
A little something I picked up
from my pal, Needles,

1432
01:29:05,424 --> 01:29:07,426
best street racer in all of Corellia.

1433
01:29:08,261 --> 01:29:09,554
Till he crashed

1434
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:11,556
and died, doing this.

1435
01:29:29,865 --> 01:29:31,492
Flood it, it's all yours!

1436
01:29:43,379 --> 01:29:45,715
Nice move!

1437
01:29:48,634 --> 01:29:50,511
Pull out her internal processor.

1438
01:29:53,306 --> 01:29:54,432
Sorry.

1439
01:30:00,605 --> 01:30:01,606
We've got L3.

1440
01:30:04,108 --> 01:30:05,443
Remove the mod calibrator.

1441
01:30:05,526 --> 01:30:06,569
Make sure the T-Line's connected.

1442
01:30:06,652 --> 01:30:08,070
I'm gonna tuck it in. Don't worry.

1443
01:30:08,154 --> 01:30:09,155
You close?

1444
01:30:09,238 --> 01:30:11,616
That coaxium's getting real ripe.

1445
01:30:12,033 --> 01:30:13,701
Okay.

1446
01:30:15,995 --> 01:30:17,663
She's interfacing.

1447
01:30:21,834 --> 01:30:23,919
She's part of the ship now.

1448
01:30:35,181 --> 01:30:36,390
Where the hell are we?

1449
01:30:36,557 --> 01:30:38,142
We're way off the edge of the map.

1450
01:30:38,768 --> 01:30:39,769
Wait.

1451
01:30:39,935 --> 01:30:42,772
L3's constructing a model of The Maelstrom.

1452
01:30:45,066 --> 01:30:47,318
She says we're approaching The Maw.

1453
01:30:47,526 --> 01:30:48,819
That doesn't sound like something

1454
01:30:48,903 --> 01:30:50,321
we wanna be approaching.

1455
01:31:11,342 --> 01:31:12,343
Hang on!

1456
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:18,724
This is The Maw?

1457
01:31:18,891 --> 01:31:20,643
No, that's not The Maw.
I don't know what this is.

1458
01:31:20,810 --> 01:31:22,061
That's a living thing.

1459
01:31:36,409 --> 01:31:37,660
There!

1460
01:31:37,952 --> 01:31:39,078
That's The Maw.

1461
01:31:41,956 --> 01:31:43,457
It's a gravity well.

1462
01:31:43,624 --> 01:31:44,625
I got an idea.

1463
01:31:46,335 --> 01:31:47,920
Don't fly toward it, Han!

1464
01:31:55,636 --> 01:31:56,637
See if it goes for this.

1465
01:31:56,804 --> 01:31:58,639
No, what are you doing?
That's the escape pod!

1466
01:32:00,015 --> 01:32:01,183
I know.

1467
01:32:04,353 --> 01:32:05,438
Then why'd you do it?

1468
01:32:12,862 --> 01:32:14,238
That's why, baby.

1469
01:32:23,205 --> 01:32:24,206
She found a way out.

1470
01:32:25,082 --> 01:32:27,418
90 degrees, to the left... ish.

1471
01:32:27,501 --> 01:32:28,502
Left-ish.

1472
01:32:28,669 --> 01:32:29,879
I can't.

1473
01:32:30,045 --> 01:32:31,672
It's taking everything we got
to stay out of The Maw.

1474
01:32:31,839 --> 01:32:33,674
It's pulling us in. We're stuck.

1475
01:32:37,553 --> 01:32:39,805
We have enough raw coaxium
to power a dozen destroyers.

1476
01:32:39,972 --> 01:32:41,807
Inject it into the fuel line,
it'll blow up the ship.

1477
01:32:41,974 --> 01:32:42,975
Not the fuel line.

1478
01:32:43,851 --> 01:32:46,395
But if we put one drop into
the fusion reactor, it might just...

1479
01:32:46,479 --> 01:32:47,563
Give us the kick we need.

1480
01:32:47,730 --> 01:32:49,690
All right, I'm on it!

1481
01:32:54,195 --> 01:32:55,780
I know, we're getting dragged in a circle.

1482
01:33:09,919 --> 01:33:11,670
Once we get lined up,
it's gonna be a straight shot.

1483
01:33:11,837 --> 01:33:14,215
As soon as that coaxium ignites,
we're gonna tear out of here

1484
01:33:14,381 --> 01:33:17,092
and the second we're clear of
The Maelstrom, we jump to lightspeed.

1485
01:33:21,013 --> 01:33:22,014
Beckett!

1486
01:33:22,348 --> 01:33:23,474
Can't talk!

1487
01:33:27,269 --> 01:33:28,312
I see it.

1488
01:33:52,962 --> 01:33:53,963
Beckett, hurry up!

1489
01:33:54,046 --> 01:33:56,006
We only get one shot at this thing!

1490
01:33:56,382 --> 01:33:58,300
Shut up and let me do this!

1491
01:34:06,225 --> 01:34:08,811
Beckett, I'm gonna count you down!

1492
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:11,355
Three!

1493
01:34:14,149 --> 01:34:15,192
Two!

1494
01:34:19,530 --> 01:34:20,531
Now!

1495
01:34:20,614 --> 01:34:21,615
Now?

1496
01:34:21,699 --> 01:34:22,700
Now!

1497
01:34:39,049 --> 01:34:40,801
Oh, shoot...

1498
01:34:53,647 --> 01:34:54,648
Chewie, when I tell you,
kick out the thrusters

1499
01:34:54,815 --> 01:34:56,650
- and jump to lightspeed.
- Wait, what are we...

1500
01:34:56,817 --> 01:34:58,944
Remember that alley we slipped
through in the Santhe Shipyards?

1501
01:34:59,028 --> 01:35:00,738
Yeah, I remember! I remember it didn't work.

1502
01:35:00,905 --> 01:35:01,989
This time it's gonna.

1503
01:35:12,416 --> 01:35:13,417
Punch it!

1504
01:35:24,511 --> 01:35:26,555
<i>Savareen, this is</i> Millennium Falcon.

1505
01:35:26,722 --> 01:35:29,475
<i>We have coaxium that needs
to be off-loaded immediately.</i>

1506
01:35:29,642 --> 01:35:32,269
<i>Like immediately, immediately!</i>

1507
01:35:32,853 --> 01:35:34,271
<i>We're here now...</i>

1508
01:35:34,438 --> 01:35:35,522
<i>...see you. I...</i>

1509
01:36:06,637 --> 01:36:08,722
Just did the Kessel Run in 12 parsecs.

1510
01:36:12,977 --> 01:36:14,478
Not if you round down, buddy.

1511
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:16,105
Yeah.

1512
01:36:22,277 --> 01:36:24,738
She is a hell of a ship.

1513
01:36:33,122 --> 01:36:34,456
I hate you.

1514
01:36:34,623 --> 01:36:36,083
I know.

1515
01:36:38,627 --> 01:36:40,504
I'm gonna be on my ship,

1516
01:36:40,671 --> 01:36:42,339
in my quarters,

1517
01:36:42,506 --> 01:36:45,759
waiting for you to bring me my share.

1518
01:36:47,845 --> 01:36:50,472
And then I don't ever wanna see you again.

1519
01:36:54,810 --> 01:36:56,395
Never?

1520
01:37:10,034 --> 01:37:11,785
Where's your boss?

1521
01:37:12,244 --> 01:37:14,747
Oh. Don't worry. He'll be here.

1522
01:37:15,706 --> 01:37:16,749
Then what?

1523
01:37:17,499 --> 01:37:20,169
Well, you delivered,

1524
01:37:20,335 --> 01:37:22,212
so you will get paid.

1525
01:37:22,379 --> 01:37:24,381
You can buy that ship.

1526
01:37:24,923 --> 01:37:28,260
You know that's not what I'm asking.

1527
01:37:30,679 --> 01:37:32,306
It can't happen.

1528
01:37:36,685 --> 01:37:38,103
Because you're with Dryden?

1529
01:37:38,270 --> 01:37:41,356
I'm not with him, but I owe him.

1530
01:37:42,900 --> 01:37:45,110
He helped me out of a bad situation.

1531
01:37:46,236 --> 01:37:48,280
And how long do you have
to pay off that debt?

1532
01:37:51,742 --> 01:37:54,119
Everyone serves somebody, Han.

1533
01:37:55,204 --> 01:37:57,206
Even Dryden Vos.

1534
01:37:57,498 --> 01:38:00,417
Look, you don't want to make
an enemy of Crimson Dawn

1535
01:38:00,584 --> 01:38:02,795
which is exactly what you
and I would both be doing

1536
01:38:02,961 --> 01:38:04,296
if I left here with you.

1537
01:38:04,463 --> 01:38:06,131
I'm not afraid of Crimson Dawn.

1538
01:38:06,298 --> 01:38:08,300
I can take care of myself.

1539
01:38:08,467 --> 01:38:09,802
You know, I'm not the kid you knew

1540
01:38:09,885 --> 01:38:11,178
on Corellia anymore, Qi'ra.

1541
01:38:11,345 --> 01:38:12,471
- No?
- No.

1542
01:38:12,638 --> 01:38:13,680
Then who are you?

1543
01:38:14,598 --> 01:38:16,016
I'm an outlaw.

1544
01:38:17,935 --> 01:38:19,144
What? I'm not kidding.

1545
01:38:19,311 --> 01:38:20,395
Okay.

1546
01:38:21,188 --> 01:38:23,398
Okay, outlaw, you can tell yourself that,

1547
01:38:23,565 --> 01:38:25,567
but I might be the only person
in the whole galaxy

1548
01:38:25,734 --> 01:38:27,069
who knows what you really are.

1549
01:38:27,236 --> 01:38:28,862
Yeah.

1550
01:38:29,154 --> 01:38:30,489
What's that?

1551
01:38:32,866 --> 01:38:34,576
You are the good guy.

1552
01:38:36,537 --> 01:38:39,206
I am not the good guy.

1553
01:38:39,373 --> 01:38:42,918
I am definitely not a good guy.

1554
01:38:43,293 --> 01:38:44,628
I'm a terrible person.

1555
01:38:45,087 --> 01:38:46,338
Hey!

1556
01:38:46,797 --> 01:38:48,257
They say when the coaxium's refined,

1557
01:38:48,340 --> 01:38:49,758
we collect it up there.

1558
01:39:14,199 --> 01:39:16,201
So, I hear you make good brandy.

1559
01:39:19,872 --> 01:39:21,498
<i>Beckett.</i>

1560
01:39:46,106 --> 01:39:47,191
Don't.

1561
01:39:48,358 --> 01:39:50,861
<i>You must've known you'd see me again.</i>

1562
01:39:51,028 --> 01:39:52,613
I was counting on it.

1563
01:39:52,779 --> 01:39:54,740
Just didn't plan on it being so soon.

1564
01:39:55,908 --> 01:39:57,701
Of course now, you've got a problem.

1565
01:39:57,868 --> 01:39:59,745
Big problem.

1566
01:40:03,457 --> 01:40:05,834
You happen to notice
that freighter down there?

1567
01:40:06,001 --> 01:40:07,753
You know what's on it?

1568
01:40:08,212 --> 01:40:09,922
About 30 hired guns.

1569
01:40:10,088 --> 01:40:11,924
All I gotta do is give 'em the signal,

1570
01:40:12,007 --> 01:40:13,425
you're surrounded.

1571
01:40:29,733 --> 01:40:31,735
Sorry. You do your thing.

1572
01:40:32,903 --> 01:40:35,280
By the time that coaxium gets refined,

1573
01:40:35,447 --> 01:40:36,990
Crimson Dawn will be here,

1574
01:40:37,157 --> 01:40:38,867
so you go ahead and kill us.

1575
01:40:39,076 --> 01:40:40,285
They're gonna kill you.

1576
01:40:40,994 --> 01:40:43,956
Perhaps there's a compromise,
one that doesn't involve so much killing.

1577
01:40:44,373 --> 01:40:45,791
They're marauders.

1578
01:40:46,375 --> 01:40:48,919
They don't care about anybody.

1579
01:40:49,753 --> 01:40:51,630
All they know how to do is kill.

1580
01:41:14,861 --> 01:41:16,321
I need a drink.

1581
01:41:16,905 --> 01:41:18,198
Bring them inside.

1582
01:41:30,544 --> 01:41:32,421
My mother once told me

1583
01:41:32,587 --> 01:41:33,922
about a band of mercenaries

1584
01:41:34,006 --> 01:41:35,632
that came to a peaceful planet.

1585
01:41:36,383 --> 01:41:39,469
They had a resource there these men coveted,

1586
01:41:39,845 --> 01:41:41,263
so they took it.

1587
01:41:41,763 --> 01:41:44,641
They kept coming back, taking more.

1588
01:41:45,392 --> 01:41:47,561
Until finally, the people resisted.

1589
01:41:48,061 --> 01:41:49,688
When they returned demanding their tribute,

1590
01:41:49,855 --> 01:41:52,899
the people shouted back
in one voice, "No more!"

1591
01:41:53,775 --> 01:41:55,902
The mercenaries didn't like
the sound of that,

1592
01:41:56,069 --> 01:41:57,446
so they cut off the tongue

1593
01:41:57,529 --> 01:42:00,449
of every last man, woman, and child.

1594
01:42:01,283 --> 01:42:03,243
Do you know what that pack of animals became?

1595
01:42:04,411 --> 01:42:05,412
Tell them.

1596
01:42:17,257 --> 01:42:19,509
Crimson Dawn and the rest of
the five Syndicates

1597
01:42:19,676 --> 01:42:21,136
have committed unspeakable crimes

1598
01:42:21,219 --> 01:42:22,471
across the galaxy.

1599
01:42:23,555 --> 01:42:24,973
Says you.

1600
01:42:25,057 --> 01:42:26,058
No.

1601
01:42:26,141 --> 01:42:27,726
Says them.

1602
01:42:28,268 --> 01:42:30,395
Each of our worlds has been brutalized

1603
01:42:30,479 --> 01:42:31,772
by the Syndicates.

1604
01:42:32,147 --> 01:42:33,648
Crimson Dawn will use their profits

1605
01:42:33,732 --> 01:42:35,025
from the coaxium you stole

1606
01:42:35,192 --> 01:42:37,152
to tyrannize system after system

1607
01:42:37,319 --> 01:42:39,279
in league with the Empire.

1608
01:42:39,446 --> 01:42:41,323
And what would you use it for?

1609
01:42:42,282 --> 01:42:44,034
The same thing my mother
would have used it for

1610
01:42:44,201 --> 01:42:46,912
if she had survived and still wore the mask.

1611
01:42:48,121 --> 01:42:49,247
To fight back.

1612
01:42:50,707 --> 01:42:52,751
We're not marauders.

1613
01:42:52,918 --> 01:42:54,669
We're allies

1614
01:42:55,420 --> 01:42:57,422
and the war has just begun.

1615
01:43:13,271 --> 01:43:16,441
You know we can't give
the coaxium to Dryden Vos.

1616
01:43:16,608 --> 01:43:18,568
Joining the cause, Han Solo?

1617
01:43:18,735 --> 01:43:20,987
Just trying to make it out alive.

1618
01:43:21,154 --> 01:43:22,155
Got a plan?

1619
01:43:22,322 --> 01:43:23,532
Yeah, beginning of one.

1620
01:43:23,615 --> 01:43:24,616
Way to get our money

1621
01:43:24,783 --> 01:43:25,992
and get out from under the thumb

1622
01:43:26,076 --> 01:43:27,369
of Crimson Dawn at the same time.

1623
01:43:27,536 --> 01:43:30,163
Maybe get your girlfriend back
while we're at it.

1624
01:43:30,997 --> 01:43:33,625
You don't tangle with Dryden.

1625
01:43:33,792 --> 01:43:37,003
Because unlike us, he actually does travel

1626
01:43:37,170 --> 01:43:39,631
with hired guns, his own private army.

1627
01:43:40,215 --> 01:43:41,716
So does Enfys.

1628
01:43:42,008 --> 01:43:44,261
Listen, here's what I got so far.

1629
01:43:46,388 --> 01:43:48,473
What do you think they're saying?

1630
01:43:51,768 --> 01:43:53,395
He's gonna try to help you.

1631
01:43:59,317 --> 01:44:00,735
I see.

1632
01:44:02,195 --> 01:44:05,782
Lot of ways it could go south,
and only one where it doesn't.

1633
01:44:05,949 --> 01:44:08,452
That's why I need my partner.

1634
01:44:12,581 --> 01:44:14,416
Not this time.

1635
01:44:14,749 --> 01:44:16,084
I'm leaving.

1636
01:44:16,251 --> 01:44:18,253
If you're smart, you'll come with me.

1637
01:44:18,420 --> 01:44:20,630
I thought you didn't believe in running.

1638
01:44:20,797 --> 01:44:23,216
I prefer it to dying.

1639
01:44:50,285 --> 01:44:52,954
If by some miracle you make it out of here,

1640
01:44:53,121 --> 01:44:54,623
find me on Tatooine.

1641
01:44:55,415 --> 01:44:57,209
What's on Tatooine?

1642
01:44:57,375 --> 01:44:58,543
Heard about a job,

1643
01:44:58,627 --> 01:45:01,254
big shot gangster putting together a crew.

1644
01:45:01,505 --> 01:45:03,173
That'll be the one.

1645
01:45:03,256 --> 01:45:04,257
The one?

1646
01:45:04,424 --> 01:45:06,218
My last score.

1647
01:45:06,676 --> 01:45:08,303
Yeah, I still got some debts to pay

1648
01:45:08,386 --> 01:45:10,847
before I can head back to Glee Anselm

1649
01:45:11,723 --> 01:45:13,725
and get into the valachord.

1650
01:45:46,967 --> 01:45:47,968
Welcome home.

1651
01:45:48,218 --> 01:45:49,970
He's waiting for you.

1652
01:45:50,136 --> 01:45:51,346
Thanks, Toht.

1653
01:45:52,973 --> 01:45:54,516
Weapons.

1654
01:45:54,683 --> 01:45:56,184
I didn't bring 'em.

1655
01:45:57,644 --> 01:45:59,020
They're fine.

1656
01:46:03,233 --> 01:46:05,235
We're gonna win.

1657
01:46:08,113 --> 01:46:09,573
It's not that kind of game, Han.

1658
01:46:11,658 --> 01:46:12,951
The object isn't to win.

1659
01:46:13,034 --> 01:46:15,120
It's just to stay in it as long as you can.

1660
01:46:18,081 --> 01:46:19,541
You don't know everything.

1661
01:46:20,584 --> 01:46:21,793
No.

1662
01:46:24,087 --> 01:46:26,131
Just a bit more than you.

1663
01:46:34,431 --> 01:46:35,432
I knew it!

1664
01:46:36,433 --> 01:46:37,684
My men, they all said,

1665
01:46:37,767 --> 01:46:39,686
"There's no way they pull this off."

1666
01:46:39,853 --> 01:46:43,732
"Qi'ra's not ready." That's what
they said, but I had faith anyway.

1667
01:46:45,609 --> 01:46:46,735
Where's Beckett?

1668
01:46:46,901 --> 01:46:48,403
Beckett didn't make it.

1669
01:46:52,198 --> 01:46:53,199
Tell me.

1670
01:46:53,366 --> 01:46:55,869
Job took a bad turn on Kessel.

1671
01:46:56,036 --> 01:46:57,495
He died saving my life.

1672
01:46:57,954 --> 01:46:59,581
How are you holding up? You all right?

1673
01:46:59,873 --> 01:47:00,874
I'm okay.

1674
01:47:01,041 --> 01:47:02,375
All right, good.

1675
01:47:02,792 --> 01:47:04,336
Colo claw fish, anyone?

1676
01:47:04,502 --> 01:47:05,754
- No. Thank you.
- No?

1677
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:08,340
You know, whatever Beckett's
shortcomings may have been,

1678
01:47:08,423 --> 01:47:09,424
I always admired him.

1679
01:47:09,591 --> 01:47:11,134
He was a man of principles.

1680
01:47:11,301 --> 01:47:13,345
When he made a commitment, he honored it

1681
01:47:13,595 --> 01:47:15,680
and I think we can all take solace

1682
01:47:15,847 --> 01:47:18,391
in knowing how proud he would've been

1683
01:47:18,558 --> 01:47:21,895
to see you here, following his example.

1684
01:47:22,062 --> 01:47:23,813
Han and Chewbacca behaved admirably.

1685
01:47:23,980 --> 01:47:26,107
They'll make reliable smugglers,
should we ever have the need

1686
01:47:26,274 --> 01:47:28,485
when they get their own ship.

1687
01:47:28,652 --> 01:47:30,862
Qi'ra. Come here.

1688
01:47:32,697 --> 01:47:34,658
We'd really appreciate the opportunity

1689
01:47:34,741 --> 01:47:35,950
to work for you again, sir.

1690
01:47:36,242 --> 01:47:37,661
I would've been inconsolable

1691
01:47:37,744 --> 01:47:39,621
if anything had happened to you, my dear.

1692
01:47:40,830 --> 01:47:42,707
I have no one else in my life

1693
01:47:43,208 --> 01:47:46,002
that I trust in the way that I trust you.

1694
01:47:49,673 --> 01:47:53,551
Well, I guess we'll just take
our payment and get going.

1695
01:47:53,635 --> 01:47:54,636
I'm sure you've got competitors to crush...

1696
01:47:54,719 --> 01:47:55,720
What?

1697
01:47:55,804 --> 01:47:57,347
...and black markets to dominate.

1698
01:47:57,430 --> 01:47:59,641
Oh. Show me what you've brought me first.

1699
01:48:00,308 --> 01:48:01,935
You want me to open it?

1700
01:48:02,435 --> 01:48:04,688
Oh, yes, Han. I really do.

1701
01:48:31,131 --> 01:48:32,298
Bring me one.

1702
01:48:32,590 --> 01:48:35,260
I don't think that's a good idea, Dryden.

1703
01:48:35,427 --> 01:48:37,345
It's very explosive stuff.

1704
01:48:37,887 --> 01:48:40,390
I never ask for anything twice, Han.

1705
01:49:00,869 --> 01:49:02,537
Careful.

1706
01:49:06,166 --> 01:49:08,001
It's magnificent.

1707
01:49:08,752 --> 01:49:09,919
How'd you do it?

1708
01:49:10,003 --> 01:49:11,004
Wasn't easy.

1709
01:49:11,087 --> 01:49:12,422
No, I mean, how'd you do it?

1710
01:49:12,589 --> 01:49:14,549
It looks exactly like the real thing.

1711
01:49:15,508 --> 01:49:17,302
That's 'cause it is the real thing.

1712
01:49:17,385 --> 01:49:20,221
Yes, and I'm saying I would believe you.
It's that good.

1713
01:49:20,388 --> 01:49:24,809
But my associate already told me about
your plan to rob me of my money

1714
01:49:24,976 --> 01:49:27,604
and give the real coaxium to Enfys Nest.

1715
01:49:27,771 --> 01:49:29,481
Dryden, I don't know what you're thinking

1716
01:49:29,647 --> 01:49:31,024
or what Qi'ra may have told you...

1717
01:49:31,191 --> 01:49:33,318
No, not Qi'ra. Not Qi'ra.

1718
01:49:33,568 --> 01:49:34,861
Qi'ra, it turns out

1719
01:49:35,028 --> 01:49:36,529
has a weak spot for you,

1720
01:49:36,613 --> 01:49:38,114
and we'll deal with that later.

1721
01:49:38,281 --> 01:49:42,118
No, I'm talking about my other associate.

1722
01:49:42,285 --> 01:49:44,287
Can you come in and join us, please?

1723
01:49:56,174 --> 01:49:59,302
I am sorry, kid.

1724
01:50:02,472 --> 01:50:03,848
Why?

1725
01:50:03,932 --> 01:50:04,933
Come on.

1726
01:50:05,016 --> 01:50:06,893
Don't look at me like that.

1727
01:50:07,060 --> 01:50:08,520
You weren't paying attention.

1728
01:50:08,603 --> 01:50:11,064
I told you, "Don't trust anybody."

1729
01:50:11,898 --> 01:50:14,067
Am I wrong about that?

1730
01:50:16,611 --> 01:50:17,695
Uh-uh-uh.

1731
01:50:18,238 --> 01:50:19,739
Back away from that.

1732
01:50:19,906 --> 01:50:21,866
Put your paws where I can see 'em.

1733
01:50:22,033 --> 01:50:23,868
Check that lid.

1734
01:50:25,912 --> 01:50:27,121
Clever.

1735
01:50:27,330 --> 01:50:28,873
It's too late.

1736
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:31,709
Coaxium's refined, and Enfys has it.

1737
01:50:32,043 --> 01:50:33,962
Well, we figured that.

1738
01:50:48,184 --> 01:50:49,978
Drop your weapons.

1739
01:50:53,356 --> 01:50:56,192
<i>It's over. We got them.</i>

1740
01:50:56,359 --> 01:50:57,694
And there we have it.

1741
01:50:57,861 --> 01:50:59,737
Excellent work, Aemon, thank you.

1742
01:50:59,904 --> 01:51:01,447
Qi'ra, help me.

1743
01:51:03,908 --> 01:51:05,451
Tell me what to do.

1744
01:51:06,202 --> 01:51:07,704
What would you do

1745
01:51:07,871 --> 01:51:12,083
if the person you most trusted in the world

1746
01:51:12,542 --> 01:51:14,002
betrayed you?

1747
01:51:16,921 --> 01:51:18,256
I would want to know why.

1748
01:51:20,633 --> 01:51:22,635
If it was a moment of weakness

1749
01:51:22,719 --> 01:51:23,720
or something else.

1750
01:51:23,887 --> 01:51:24,888
And then what?

1751
01:51:26,431 --> 01:51:29,309
And then, I would ask that person

1752
01:51:29,475 --> 01:51:31,769
to prove their loyalty

1753
01:51:31,936 --> 01:51:35,899
by sacrificing something they love.

1754
01:51:43,990 --> 01:51:46,200
I tried to warn you about her.

1755
01:51:46,367 --> 01:51:48,536
You know, you're wrong about one thing.

1756
01:51:48,912 --> 01:51:49,913
What?

1757
01:51:50,204 --> 01:51:52,165
I was paying attention.

1758
01:51:52,332 --> 01:51:54,792
You told Chewie people are predictable.

1759
01:51:57,337 --> 01:51:59,464
You're no exception.

1760
01:52:05,178 --> 01:52:06,179
It's empty.

1761
01:52:06,346 --> 01:52:07,639
<i>The case is empty.</i>

1762
01:52:07,847 --> 01:52:10,224
Aemon, what's going on?
What's happening there?

1763
01:52:10,391 --> 01:52:11,643
Aemon?

1764
01:52:11,809 --> 01:52:12,977
Talk to me.

1765
01:52:38,795 --> 01:52:41,714
I hope you didn't send
all your fancy enforcers

1766
01:52:41,881 --> 01:52:43,383
because that would leave you

1767
01:52:43,466 --> 01:52:45,635
a little shorthanded around here.

1768
01:52:46,761 --> 01:52:47,762
So,

1769
01:52:48,471 --> 01:52:52,266
if that case is empty,
then the real coaxium...

1770
01:52:52,433 --> 01:52:54,310
Leaves here with one of us.

1771
01:52:59,399 --> 01:53:00,775
Beckett, what are you doing?

1772
01:53:00,858 --> 01:53:01,859
Thinking.

1773
01:53:02,026 --> 01:53:03,403
And I prefer to be the only one

1774
01:53:03,486 --> 01:53:05,029
holding a blaster while I'm doing it.

1775
01:53:05,196 --> 01:53:06,572
Han, grab that coaxium,

1776
01:53:06,739 --> 01:53:07,991
put it in the case.

1777
01:53:08,157 --> 01:53:09,575
Big stuff, you're coming with me.

1778
01:53:11,494 --> 01:53:12,745
Don't do this, Beckett.

1779
01:53:12,912 --> 01:53:14,664
- We had a deal.
- Yeah.

1780
01:53:14,747 --> 01:53:15,748
I'm sorry,

1781
01:53:15,832 --> 01:53:17,250
but I'm also an entrepreneur.

1782
01:53:17,417 --> 01:53:19,544
I mean, you of all people understand that.

1783
01:53:20,003 --> 01:53:21,170
Come on, let's go.

1784
01:53:22,213 --> 01:53:24,090
You're making a huge mistake.

1785
01:53:24,257 --> 01:53:25,341
Won't be my first.

1786
01:53:25,508 --> 01:53:26,884
It's gonna be your last.

1787
01:53:27,176 --> 01:53:28,344
Maybe.

1788
01:53:29,303 --> 01:53:30,805
Why you gotta be so negative?

1789
01:53:43,484 --> 01:53:44,610
Han,

1790
01:53:44,777 --> 01:53:46,487
now's as good a time as any

1791
01:53:46,571 --> 01:53:48,281
to reevaluate our relationship.

1792
01:53:48,823 --> 01:53:49,866
How so?

1793
01:53:50,533 --> 01:53:51,993
I was just thinking,

1794
01:53:52,410 --> 01:53:55,288
why don't we join forces
and go get Beckett together?

1795
01:53:55,455 --> 01:53:58,750
That is a great idea.
Let's do it. You go first.

1796
01:53:59,709 --> 01:54:01,502
Oh, Han.

1797
01:54:28,321 --> 01:54:31,949
You can't win, Han, and even if you could,
you'd spend the rest of your life

1798
01:54:32,033 --> 01:54:33,034
looking over your shoulder.

1799
01:54:34,285 --> 01:54:35,286
You know what?

1800
01:54:36,287 --> 01:54:38,081
I'm kind of getting used to the idea.

1801
01:54:45,671 --> 01:54:47,131
I'm sorry.

1802
01:54:47,298 --> 01:54:49,258
Han, she's done things that

1803
01:54:49,342 --> 01:54:52,011
you could never understand, but I do.

1804
01:54:52,178 --> 01:54:54,097
I understand her completely.

1805
01:54:55,098 --> 01:54:57,266
Once you're a part of Crimson Dawn,

1806
01:54:57,433 --> 01:54:58,810
you can't leave.

1807
01:54:59,185 --> 01:55:00,812
It's not true.

1808
01:55:00,978 --> 01:55:02,230
I know you.

1809
01:55:02,647 --> 01:55:04,649
It's what I was taught.

1810
01:55:04,816 --> 01:55:06,567
Find your opponent's weakness,

1811
01:55:06,734 --> 01:55:07,902
and use it,

1812
01:55:08,069 --> 01:55:10,154
and today...

1813
01:55:12,532 --> 01:55:13,825
I'm yours.

1814
01:55:39,767 --> 01:55:41,227
I had to.

1815
01:55:42,311 --> 01:55:44,438
Yeah. No, I mean, you did...

1816
01:55:44,605 --> 01:55:46,524
You did.

1817
01:55:48,651 --> 01:55:50,653
Beckett and Chewbacca,
you have to go after them.

1818
01:55:50,820 --> 01:55:52,029
What are you gonna do?

1819
01:55:52,196 --> 01:55:54,699
Well, if we give all the coaxium to Enfys,

1820
01:55:54,866 --> 01:55:57,702
we're gonna need something
to buy our ship with.

1821
01:56:11,340 --> 01:56:13,843
- Qi'ra...
- Go and save Chewbacca.

1822
01:56:14,010 --> 01:56:17,263
He needs you and you're gonna need him, too.

1823
01:56:23,603 --> 01:56:24,604
Smile.

1824
01:56:27,273 --> 01:56:29,734
That's the word.

1825
01:56:29,901 --> 01:56:31,152
Whenever I imagined myself

1826
01:56:31,235 --> 01:56:33,362
off with you on some adventure...

1827
01:56:34,405 --> 01:56:36,490
Always makes me smile.

1828
01:56:44,040 --> 01:56:46,083
Go. I'm right behind you.

1829
01:57:37,593 --> 01:57:38,803
<i>Yes?</i>

1830
01:57:39,053 --> 01:57:42,056
I regret to inform you
that Dryden Vos is dead,

1831
01:57:42,682 --> 01:57:44,392
murdered by the thief he hired

1832
01:57:44,475 --> 01:57:45,851
to steal the coaxium shipment,

1833
01:57:46,018 --> 01:57:47,353
his friend,

1834
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:49,272
Tobias Beckett.

1835
01:57:49,438 --> 01:57:52,275
<i>Is that so?</i>

1836
01:57:52,441 --> 01:57:55,528
<i>Where is the shipment now?</i>

1837
01:57:55,695 --> 01:57:56,737
Gone.

1838
01:57:56,904 --> 01:57:57,905
Beckett took it.

1839
01:57:58,072 --> 01:58:00,491
Slaughtered the others. I alone survived.

1840
01:58:03,661 --> 01:58:06,831
<i>One man couldn't have done this alone.</i>

1841
01:58:07,581 --> 01:58:09,125
I wasn't there,

1842
01:58:09,292 --> 01:58:12,128
but if I had been, perhaps
I could have saved him.

1843
01:58:20,219 --> 01:58:23,723
<i>Bring the ship and come to me on Dathomir</i>

1844
01:58:23,889 --> 01:58:25,725
<i>and you and I will then decide</i>

1845
01:58:25,808 --> 01:58:28,102
<i>what to do about the traitor, Beckett,</i>

1846
01:58:28,269 --> 01:58:30,896
<i>and his accomplices.</i>

1847
01:58:33,065 --> 01:58:34,400
I'm on my way.

1848
01:58:36,777 --> 01:58:37,945
<i>Qi'ra,</i>

1849
01:58:38,112 --> 01:58:39,322
<i>you and I</i>

1850
01:58:39,488 --> 01:58:42,450
<i>will be working much more closely</i>

1851
01:58:42,616 --> 01:58:44,577
<i>from now on.</i>

1852
01:59:14,607 --> 01:59:16,901
You're relentless. I'll give you that.

1853
01:59:18,361 --> 01:59:20,654
Came as fast as I could, buddy.

1854
01:59:20,988 --> 01:59:22,406
Dryden dead?

1855
01:59:24,408 --> 01:59:26,243
Qi'ra kill him?

1856
01:59:28,037 --> 01:59:30,289
Still don't get it, do you, kid?

1857
01:59:30,623 --> 01:59:32,875
It was never about you.

1858
01:59:33,334 --> 01:59:35,086
She's a survivor.

1859
01:59:36,003 --> 01:59:37,546
You know what your problem is?

1860
01:59:37,713 --> 01:59:39,757
You think everybody's like you.

1861
01:59:40,424 --> 01:59:42,009
Not you, kid.

1862
01:59:42,176 --> 01:59:43,803
You're nothing like me.

1863
01:59:45,721 --> 01:59:47,139
I hope you're still paying attention

1864
01:59:47,306 --> 01:59:49,350
because now I'm gonna tell you
the most important...

1865
02:00:04,365 --> 02:00:06,951
You made the smart move, kid.

1866
02:00:07,118 --> 02:00:08,327
For once.

1867
02:00:09,829 --> 02:00:11,455
I woulda killed you.

1868
02:00:19,171 --> 02:00:23,217
I really was gonna
learn to play that valachord.

1869
02:00:23,676 --> 02:00:25,094
I know.

1870
02:02:18,290 --> 02:02:19,542
That's it. It's all loaded.

1871
02:02:23,921 --> 02:02:25,256
Do you know what that really is?

1872
02:02:25,339 --> 02:02:26,382
Yeah.

1873
02:02:26,465 --> 02:02:29,301
About 60 million credits
worth of refined coaxium.

1874
02:02:29,468 --> 02:02:30,511
No.

1875
02:02:30,678 --> 02:02:32,930
It's the blood that brings
life to something new.

1876
02:02:33,138 --> 02:02:35,099
Yeah, what?

1877
02:02:35,307 --> 02:02:36,559
A rebellion.

1878
02:02:37,518 --> 02:02:39,395
You could come with us, you know.

1879
02:02:39,562 --> 02:02:41,855
We need warriors and leaders like you.

1880
02:02:48,445 --> 02:02:50,406
Maybe someday you'll feel different.

1881
02:02:50,864 --> 02:02:53,117
Don't hold your breath, kid.

1882
02:03:07,965 --> 02:03:09,341
Don't lose that.

1883
02:03:21,103 --> 02:03:23,022
Very few people have actually seen

1884
02:03:23,105 --> 02:03:24,565
the StarCave Nebula.

1885
02:03:24,732 --> 02:03:25,816
It's breathtaking.

1886
02:03:25,983 --> 02:03:27,484
Not unlike your eyes.

1887
02:03:27,651 --> 02:03:29,361
How much do you know about
intertwined celestial bodies?

1888
02:03:29,528 --> 02:03:31,739
Because I happen to be
something of an authority.

1889
02:03:32,948 --> 02:03:35,242
By the way...

1890
02:03:40,372 --> 02:03:41,957
Han!

1891
02:03:42,041 --> 02:03:43,042
You're alive!

1892
02:03:43,125 --> 02:03:44,209
Yeah, no thanks to you.

1893
02:03:44,376 --> 02:03:45,878
I should have Chewie rip your arms off.

1894
02:03:46,045 --> 02:03:47,254
In fact, Chewie, do it.

1895
02:03:47,421 --> 02:03:48,839
Hey, Han! We are friends.

1896
02:03:49,006 --> 02:03:50,507
You know that. We're friends. All right?

1897
02:03:56,055 --> 02:03:57,681
Oh, look at you.

1898
02:03:57,848 --> 02:03:59,224
Thought he was gonna rip your arms off.

1899
02:03:59,391 --> 02:04:00,476
I knew you were kidding.

1900
02:04:00,559 --> 02:04:01,560
No, you didn't.

1901
02:04:01,644 --> 02:04:03,145
- So, where's my cut?
- Your cut?

1902
02:04:04,438 --> 02:04:06,607
No, I don't think so.
We barely made it out alive.

1903
02:04:06,774 --> 02:04:08,776
All we ended up with was that.

1904
02:04:09,276 --> 02:04:10,319
Mmm-mmm.

1905
02:04:10,736 --> 02:04:12,488
Figure it's worth about 10,000,

1906
02:04:12,571 --> 02:04:14,156
maybe enough for a decent buy-in.

1907
02:04:16,116 --> 02:04:17,534
You want a rematch?

1908
02:04:18,869 --> 02:04:20,120
Why not?

1909
02:04:24,208 --> 02:04:27,378
You fold now, you walk away with enough

1910
02:04:27,461 --> 02:04:29,630
to get yourself your own little ship.

1911
02:04:29,797 --> 02:04:31,298
You call,

1912
02:04:32,132 --> 02:04:34,259
I'm gonna clean you out again.

1913
02:04:46,397 --> 02:04:47,690
I don't know, I'm feeling lucky.

1914
02:04:50,150 --> 02:04:51,819
Ooh.

1915
02:04:52,569 --> 02:04:54,822
You really have it bad
for the <i>Falcon,</i> don't you?

1916
02:04:54,988 --> 02:04:57,783
It's mutual, trust me. She belongs with me.

1917
02:05:07,334 --> 02:05:09,795
You got everything you need there, pal?

1918
02:05:19,596 --> 02:05:21,098
Not bad.

1919
02:05:21,598 --> 02:05:23,475
Not bad. You know,

1920
02:05:24,226 --> 02:05:27,563
if you'd only had this little green sylop,

1921
02:05:28,439 --> 02:05:30,107
you would've beaten this.

1922
02:05:35,362 --> 02:05:38,532
Fair and square, baby. Fair and square.

1923
02:05:49,376 --> 02:05:52,963
Beckett said he heard about this
very big gangster putting together a job.

1924
02:05:53,797 --> 02:05:57,092
No, I'm telling ya, it's gonna be great.

1925
02:05:57,259 --> 02:05:59,136
When have I ever steered you wrong?
