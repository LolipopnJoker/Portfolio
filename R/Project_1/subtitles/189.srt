825
00:46:56,262 --> 00:46:59,133
Wait.
You two work together?

826
00:47:00,238 --> 00:47:01,507
- Yeah.

Are you hurt?

No, I'm fine.

I appreciate that.

we could've anticipated...

833
00:47:14,596 --> 00:47:17,158
I don't believe
we've been introduced.

834
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,208
Yeah. This is Han Solo
and Chewbacca.

835
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:21,804
They're with me.

00:47:21,807 --> 00:47:23,535
I'm Dryden Vos.

837
00:47:23,817 --> 00:47:27,400
I see you've already met
my top lieutenant.

838
00:47:29,836 --> 00:47:32,016
Han and I grew up
together on Corellia.

Oh, fellow scrumrat.

840
00:47:35,208 --> 00:47:38,539
I admire anyone who can crawl
their way out of the sewer.

841
00:47:38,672 --> 00:47:41,456
Especially,
a sewer as putrid as Corellia.

<font color="#808080">DRYDEN</font>: Beckett, you have
put me in a terrible position.

852
00:48:07,644 --> 00:48:09,725
I know, Dryden,
and I am sorry.

853
00:48:09,784 --> 00:48:10,709
You're sorry?

854
00:48:10,747 --> 00:48:12,210
<font color="#ff8040">BECKETT</font>: Dryden, there were
complications.

855
00:48:12,212 --> 00:48:13,000
There were factors.

856
00:48:13,002 --> 00:48:16,423
Enfys Nest has been
a constant irritation forever.

857
00:48:16,425 --> 00:48:18,032
It's one you should've
anticipated,

858
00:48:18,034 --> 00:48:19,595
it's one you should've
dealt with.

859
00:48:19,597 --> 00:48:21,083
Trust me, I know
I made a mistake,

860
00:48:21,152 --> 00:48:24,076
but when you hired me,
you told me

861
00:48:24,078 --> 00:48:25,076
no one else
had this information...

862
00:48:25,078 --> 00:48:26,467
Test me!

863
00:48:27,539 --> 00:48:30,436
Test me one more time,
you'll see what happens.

864
00:48:30,508 --> 00:48:32,895
<font color="#ff00ff">QI'RA</font>: I think what Dryden
is trying to say

865
00:48:32,897 --> 00:48:35,828
is that we're not interested
in why you don't have it.

866
00:48:36,036 --> 00:48:37,890
No, I'm not interested.

867
00:48:37,892 --> 00:48:39,701
I'm not interested
at all.

868
00:48:39,889 --> 00:48:40,963
<font color="#ff8040">BECKETT</font>: Dryden,

869
00:48:40,965 --> 00:48:42,938
what can I do
to make this right?

870
00:48:43,019 --> 00:48:44,847
"Make this right?"

871
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,316
There is no
making this right.

872
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:48,846
You know who I answer to

873
00:48:48,848 --> 00:48:51,201
and you know
what he'll expect of me.

874
00:48:51,203 --> 00:48:53,340
He'll say, "There have
to be consequences."

875
00:48:53,342 --> 00:48:57,067
So here's what I need you
to do for me.

876
00:48:57,195 --> 00:49:00,730
I need you to give me
a reason

877
00:49:01,192 --> 00:49:03,837
not to kill you all.

878
00:49:03,886 --> 00:49:05,796
Because I will
make it up to you.

879
00:49:05,798 --> 00:49:07,076
No, no, no. How?

880
00:49:07,078 --> 00:49:08,363
How will you
make it up to me?

881
00:49:08,365 --> 00:49:11,764
By delivering exactly
what was promised.

882
00:49:12,577 --> 00:49:15,431
100 k-grams of
refined coaxium?

883
00:49:15,433 --> 00:49:18,869
Yes. We will simply steal it
from somewhere else.

884
00:49:18,871 --> 00:49:20,301
From where?

885
00:49:20,382 --> 00:49:21,510
You'll be hard pushed
to find that

886
00:49:21,512 --> 00:49:23,187
anywhere outside
an Imperial vault.

887
00:49:23,189 --> 00:49:25,184
Scarif.
Maybe Mercy Island.

888
00:49:25,186 --> 00:49:26,520
<font color="#808080">DRYDEN</font>: That's impossible.

889
00:49:26,522 --> 00:49:29,219
So, let's come up
with some other options.

890
00:49:29,286 --> 00:49:30,581
Other ideas
that we might...

891
00:49:30,583 --> 00:49:32,486
What about unrefined?

892
00:49:35,641 --> 00:49:38,694
<font color="#ff00ff">QI'RA</font>: Well, the only known
source of astatic coaxium

893
00:49:38,741 --> 00:49:41,690
is a fissure vent beneath
the spice mines on Kessel.

894
00:49:41,692 --> 00:49:43,925
Yeah. That's the one
I was thinking of.

895
00:49:43,927 --> 00:49:45,558
That's a very,
very good one.

896
00:49:45,637 --> 00:49:47,850
<font color="#808080">DRYDEN</font>: But see,
the Pykes control Kessel.

897
00:49:47,903 --> 00:49:48,926
Crimson Dawn maintains

898
00:49:48,968 --> 00:49:51,263
a fragile alliance
with the Pykes.

899
00:49:51,352 --> 00:49:53,628
It's one that
I can't jeopardize

900
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:55,759
without risking an all-out
war with the Syndicates,

901
00:49:55,761 --> 00:49:58,939
and that, gentlemen,
I will not do.

902
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:02,735
So, if that's all you have,
I think we're done here.

903
00:50:02,737 --> 00:50:03,598
Not all we have.

904
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,630
We don't have any alliance
with the Pykes.

905
00:50:06,632 --> 00:50:09,101
Right, so nobody is gonna know
we're working for you.

906
00:50:19,089 --> 00:50:20,090
<font color="#808080">DRYDEN</font>: Possible?

907
00:50:20,554 --> 00:50:21,817
It's risky.

908
00:50:21,819 --> 00:50:24,517
As soon as the raw coaxium
is removed from the vault,

909
00:50:24,519 --> 00:50:26,173
it starts to destabilize,

910
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:27,808
so unless...

911
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:29,339
Unless...

912
00:50:29,669 --> 00:50:30,937

Unless you could
find somewhere

915
00:50:34,483 --> 00:50:36,183
to get it processed fast.

Savareen.

920
00:50:43,382 --> 00:50:45,288
Yeah,
it's an old refinery there

921
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:47,472

Imperial jurisdiction.

the people shouted back
in one voice, "No more!"

The mercenaries didn't like
the sound of that,
