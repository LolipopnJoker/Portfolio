1
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,280
<i>My children.</i>

2
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:40,700
<i>From the very beginning, it was
the children who gave me my power.</i>

3
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:46,290
<i>"The Springwood Slasher,"
that's what they called me.</i>

4
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,150
<i>My reign of terror
was legendary.</i>

5
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,320
<i>Dozens of children would fall
by my blades.</i>

6
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,290
<i>Then the parents of Springwood
came for me...</i>

7
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,630
<i>...taking justice into
their own hands.</i>

8
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:41,100
When I was alive,
I might have been a little naughty.

9
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:46,810
But after they killed me,
I became something much, much worse.

10
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,650
The stuff nightmares are made of.

11
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,860
<i>The children still feared me...</i>

12
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,360
<i>...and their fear gave me the power
to invade their dreams.</i>

13
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,780
<i>And that's when the fun
really began.</i>

14
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:09,040
<i>Until they figured out a way
to forget about me.</i>

15
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,210
<i>To erase me completely.</i>

16
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,720
<i>Being dead wasn't a problem.
But being forgotten, now that's a bitch.</i>

17
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,970
It's only a dream!

18
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,220
Die, motherfucker!

19
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,520
<i>I can't come back
if nobody remembers me.</i>

20
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,770
<i>I can't come back if
nobody's afraid.</i>

21
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,030
<i>I had to search the
bowels of hell...</i>

22
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,990
...but I found someone.

23
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,740
Someone who'll make them remember.

24
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,540
<i>He may get the blood,
but I'll get the glory.</i>

25
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:56,000
<i>And that fear is
my ticket home.</i>

26
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,510
Mike?

27
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,050
Is that you?

28
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,560
All right, fuck you then.
I'm heading in.

29
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,910
Mike?

30
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,870
Come on, it's not funny anymore.

31
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,420
Ah!

32
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,210
No!

33
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,970
<i>Jason.</i>

34
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,060
I should have been watching them,
not drinking.

35
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:19,060
Not meeting a boy at the lake.

36
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,020
I deserved to be punished.

37
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,400
We all deserved to be punished.

38
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,740
Jason.

39
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,240
My special, special boy.

40
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,080
Do you know what your gift is?

41
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,710
No matter what they do to you,
you cannot die.

42
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,750
You can never die.

43
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,550
You've just been sleeping, honey.

44
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:50,390
But now the time has
come to wake up.

45
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,850
Mommy has something
she wants you to do.

46
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,600
<i>I need you to go to Elm Street.</i>

47
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:03,190
<i>The children have been very bad
on Elm Street.</i>

48
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,780
<i>Rise up, Jason.
Your work isn't finished.</i>

49
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:13,660
<i>Hear my voice and live again.</i>

50
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:26,130
Make them remember me, Jason.

51
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,880
Make them remember
what fear tastes like.

52
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:36,970
I've been away from my children
for far too long.

53
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,480
Marry, fuck or kill.
Your choices are the Three Stooges.

54
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,480
Go. Kia.

55
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,860
Oh, God.

56
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,150
Which one had the super
bad toupee hair?

57
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,190
Harry. Mar--

58
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,360
- No, no, no, it was Moe.
- Moe.

59
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,370
- Yeah.
- Either one, I'd kill him.

60
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,120
Okay, who would you fuck, then?

61
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,490
- This is stupid, y'all, stupid.
- Oh, come on.

62
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,790
Oh, God, whatever.

63
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,040
Look, I'd fuck the bald guy
and I'd marry Larry, Jesus.

64
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,590
Is this what we're doing all night?
Because, y'all, this is really stank.

65
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,010
Hey. Gibb, what are you doing?
I thought you were gonna quit.

66
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,010
- I only smoke when I drink now.
- But you're always drinking.

67
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,890
Yeah, well, I'll work on that next.

68
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,850
Hey, okay. I got another one.

69
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,520
Fred, Scooby or Shaggy?

70
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,650
I'm not answering that
and neither is she.

71
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,730
- Do you guys think I should get a nose job?
- Oh, my God.

72
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,400
Oh, please.
Kia, what you need is a lobotomy.

73
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:16,030
I think I'm gonna get some candles.

74
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,330
I'm gonna get some beer.
Do you guys want anything?

75
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,500
- Are you sure you should be driving?
- I'm so under the limit, Lori.

76
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,670
- Surprise.
- Oh, Trey, you answered my prayers.

77
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,460
Thank you.

78
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:34,220
Whoa, babe. What did I tell you
about kissing me after you smoked, huh?

79
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,840
Lighten up. They're menthols.

80
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,350
Yeah, I brought Blake.
Where's Linda?

81
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,560
It's "Lori."

82
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,100
This is her house,
so don't be a total cocksmith.

83
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,930
Whatever.

84
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,440
- Where are the ladies?
- Relax, they'll be here.

85
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,820
I'm relaxed, man.
I'm just wet. It sucks.

86
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,110
Did you know they were coming over?

87
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,450
You gotta be quiet.

88
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,660
Hey, we knew you gonna be here
all alone this weekend.

89
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,490
I mean, Blake's cute.

90
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,040
- He's not my type.
- Who is?

91
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:09,290
No one's ever gonna live up to the
fuzzy memory of your first love, Lori.

92
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,130
You were fucking 14, get over it.

93
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:14,800
Yeah, I know we were young,
but what Will and I had was real.

94
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,630
Well, correct me if I'm wrong...

95
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,470
...but didn't Mr. Real just drop-kick your ass
without so much as a goodbye handshake?

96
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,270
He ever even call or maybe even write
to you after he moved?

97
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,940
- Send you an e-mail?
- No.

98
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:29,980
You see my point.

99
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,270
It's time to leave the convent, Lori.

100
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,980
You need to meet a guy.

101
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,370
Ugh.

102
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:57,840
Hey, Lori,
I like the flow of your place.

103
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:01,050
- Got good feng shui.
- Yeah.

104
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,190
You know about feng shui?

105
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,860
Oh. Oh!

106
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,860
Oh, you should see her bedroom.
Great flow in there.

107
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:19,490
Lori, why don't you go upstairs
and show Blake your feng shui?

108
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,820
Shut up.

109
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,830
I got a kink in my neck.

110
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:28,870
Come on, you can massage
it out for me.

111
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:34,590
I think I need a few more drinks
before there'll be any massaging.

112
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,550
- What do you see in him?
- I don't know.

113
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,840
But he has a cute ass.

114
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,550
Babe.

115
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,350
Don't make me ask you twice, okay?

116
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,190
So, Lori, am I gonna
get that grand tour or what?

117
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:58,240
Yeah. You know, why don't you start
in the kitchen and get us some beers?

118
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,700
Cool.

119
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,830
Oh, my God, Kia, he is a total idiot.
Get him out of here.

120
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,250
Oh, Lori, come on,
give him a chance.

121
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,580
I don't like him.

122
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,250
You know what? You don't like anybody.
Lori, you've barely gone out since--

123
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,010
Since what? Since my mom died?
Yeah, you know what, my dad needs me.

124
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,260
So I can't just go out
with guys all the time.

125
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,680
And if I did, it would not be
with somebody like Blake.

126
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,850
Yeah, fuck me, baby.

127
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,030
Your back door was open.

128
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,320
I closed it.

129
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:29,910
Babe, you know I don't like
to be touched after, okay?

130
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,790
Fine. I'll go have a shower then.

131
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,580
Good.

132
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,340
Your hair smells
like menthols, anyway.

133
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,380
Asshole.

134
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,680
Ah!

135
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,900
Trey.

136
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,860
What the hell are you doing?

137
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,740
Ah!

138
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:59,120
Help!

139
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,260
- Help us!
- Help us! Please, help us!

140
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,880
- Help! Help! Somebody help us!
- Somebody!

141
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,760
Wait! Help us!

142
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,180
- Help us.
- You kids need some assistance?

143
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,270
What the fuck do you think?

144
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:18,770
We need to lock this down now.
Keep it contained, you hear me?

145
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,110
Killed in bed? Jesus.

146
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,610
It's even the same damn house.

147
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,110
1428 Elm.

148
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,860
It's gotta be him, right?
It's gotta be Freddy Kru--

149
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:32,620
Hey, don't even say that son
of a bitch's name out loud.

150
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,450
Let's just keep it together.

151
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,250
We've been through too much
to let this thing spread now.

152
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,580
Take all these kids to the station.
Keep them separate. Do it now.

153
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,920
Yes, sir.

154
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:44,290
- We'll be in touch.
- Thank you. Let's go.

155
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,130
So?

156
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,640
She doesn't know anything.

157
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,220
None of them do.

158
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,100
- I'm sure we're good.
- Pretty sure?

159
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,350
Make sure none of those kids
knows anything...

160
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,020
...or I'll send your ass
up to Westin Hills with them.

161
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:05,400
- Knows what? What do you mean?
- Good work there tonight, Stubbs.

162
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,610
Right place, right time.

163
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,320
But we'll take it from here,
all right?

164
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,500
Your father's on his way.

165
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,330
- Do they know who did this?
- No, not yet.

166
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,670
But I thought I heard one of
the officers mention a name.

167
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,510
You know, to tell you the truth, Lori,
I just moved here about a month ago.

168
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,590
But if they have a suspect, I'd know.

169
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,100
They asked me all these really
weird questions, like, about my dream--

170
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:50,860
What was the name?

171
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,080
Freddy.

172
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,260
Hello?

173
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,440
Are you okay?

174
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:14,610
Oh!

175
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,910
His name is Freddy Krueger.

176
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,080
And he loves children.

177
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,700
Especially little girls.

178
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:26,290
Freddy's coming back.

179
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,960
Soon he'll be strong enough.

180
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,800
It's okay to be afraid.

181
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,380
We were all afraid.

182
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:38,050
Warn your friends. Warn everyone.

183
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,140
Ah!

184
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,650
<i>One, two, Freddy's coming for you</i>

185
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:56,150
<i>Three, four, better lock your door</i>

186
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,200
<i>Five, six, grab a crucifix</i>

187
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:04,450
<i>Seven, eight, gonna stay up late</i>

188
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,580
<i>Nine, ten, never sleep again</i>

189
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:13,000
<i>One, two, Freddy's coming for you</i>

190
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,340
- Ah!
- Ah!

191
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:24,350
Blake, we have to talk.

192
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,060
What the hell were you
doing over there?

193
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,310
You were supposed
to be watching your sister.

194
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,360
What, were you drinking?

195
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:38,110
My best friend was just killed, Dad!

196
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,820
So how about giving me
some fucking space?

197
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,750
You watch yourself, boy.

198
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,680
I'm gonna get him for you, Trey.

199
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,060
Cop let it slip.
Somebody named Freddy.

200
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,890
I'm gonna take him out myself, Trey.

201
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,690
Swear to God.

202
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,080
Who is that?

203
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,290
Someone there?

204
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,760
Jesus.

205
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,470
Ah!

206
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,890
I'm okay. I'm all right.

207
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,820
Not strong enough yet.

208
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,950
Well, I will be soon enough.

209
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:09,700
Until then,
I'll let Jason have some fun.

210
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,880
Dad.

211
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,220
Ah!

212
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,320
"Hypnocil."

213
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:50,450
What does this shit do, anyway?
How come we all have to take it?

214
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,660
Keeps you nice and docile
while I kick your little ass.

215
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,460
I'm fine with that.

216
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:05,010
<i>We interrupt this program
for a special report.</i>

217
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,930
<i>After tonight's murder
in this neighborhood of Springwood...</i>

218
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,640
<i>...Sheriff's Department has confirmed
that there is one victim.</i>

219
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:12,930
Hey, turn that up, man.

220
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,020
<i>Details of the tragedy
remain sketchy--</i>

221
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,600
Sorry, Will. You know the rules.

222
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:20,980
Turn that back on.
I know somebody that lives in that house.

223
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,900
Come on, turn it back on, man.

224
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:26,780
I never ask for anything.
Just turn on the fucking TV, please.

225
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:33,620
Fuck you, man.
What the fuck is your problem?

226
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:37,250
What are you doing? You want 10 cc's
of that pink tranquilizer in your ass?

227
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,630
That was Lori's house.
They said something about a murder.

228
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,380
I gotta go there.
I gotta go see if she's okay.

229
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,670
Back to Springwood?

230
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,050
Do you want me
to start having nightmares again?

231
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,760
Don't start with that dream-demon
shit again, okay?

232
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:53,430
You know that's all just in your head.

233
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,810
Yeah, and who are you?
The poster boy for sanity?

234
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,770
You're the one that told the cops
Lori's dad killed his wife.

235
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,400
Looks like someone else got killed
in the same house.

236
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:06,320
You think that's a coincidence?
Two murders in one house?

237
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,070
Kurt.

238
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,740
How may times do I have to tell you, man?
I don't do checkers.

239
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,660
I'm an Uno guy, all right?

240
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:17,580
So go grab the fucking Uno deck
and we'll play, okay?

241
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,080
Please. Thank you.

242
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,250
Look at us, Will.

243
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,880
Look around you, man.

244
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:29,680
We're institutionalized.

245
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,720
We're stuck here.
We're not going anywhere.

246
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,770
I do miss my family, man.

247
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:49,990
I mean, it's been four years
since I've seen them, you know.

248
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:54,120
All these years, you're still
convinced you saw her father do that?

249
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,950
I know what I saw, Mark.

250
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:59,120
Fuck what the doctors tried
to get me to believe.

251
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,210
I need to know if she's okay.

252
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,140
You wanna play?

253
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,490
Sweet dreams, monkey boy.

254
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,500
What the hell was that for, man?

255
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,220
You're a fucking lunatic, you know that?

256
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,840
I know you are, but what am I?

257
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,490
Are you sure you didn't see anyone?

258
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,070
No, Dad. None of us did.

259
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,370
I already went over this with the police.

260
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:30,960
It's just, I don't know what I'd do
without you. You're all I have left.

261
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,720
Dad, I'm not going anywhere.

262
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,470
I promise.

263
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,810
Look at you.

264
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,810
You're exhausted.

265
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,350
<i>Lori.</i>

266
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,020
We need to get you to bed.

267
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,400
I don't wanna go to sleep, Dad.
I just wanna see my friends.

268
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:56,410
I don't think it's a good idea
for you to go to school today.

269
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:58,530
You've been through
a traumatic experience.

270
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,620
Dad, please.

271
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,250
I just need to get out of the house, okay?

272
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:07,130
I'll be fine, I promise.

273
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,340
Well, at least drink your juice.

274
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,560
Will Rollins and the Davis boy escaped
from Westin Hills last night.

275
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,810
Oh, Jesus.

276
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,980
It's all coming apart again.

277
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:31,730
Don't worry. We'll find them.

278
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,530
Keep this thing contained.

279
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,790
- Lori.
- Oh, my God.

280
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,750
Hello. -God, you guys,
I'm so glad you're here.

281
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,630
Blake's dead too.

282
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,800
What?

283
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,300
Yeah, he....

284
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:02,810
He was stabbed to death late last night.

285
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,770
- Same with his dad.
- What?

286
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:13,150
Shit, shit. This is bullshit. The police
are blaming everything on Blake...

287
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:17,150
...like it's some kind of Columbine thing,
or something. They say he went crazy.

288
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,740
Killed Trey, killed his dad
and then took his own life.

289
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:24,080
This is so fucking messed up.
This is messed up.

290
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,000
Excuse me, sorry.

291
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,370
Lori?

292
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,080
- What is it, Linderman?
- Hey, Kia.

293
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:33,380
Well, I heard what happened,
and I just wanna express how--

294
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,260
Or to tell you how sorry I was.

295
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,300
Thank you. That's sweet.

296
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:41,220
Right. You know, if you need anybody
to talk to or maybe--

297
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,470
Whoa, Linderman, let me give you a tip.

298
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,060
Place your hormones back in the box
and quit while you're ahead, okay?

299
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:50,650
We don't have time for date-a-dork
right now. Thanks.

300
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,150
Right. Sorry.

301
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,150
I swear, every day it's the same thing.

302
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:59,070
He's like one of those fucking froufrou dogs
that keeps humping your leg.

303
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:03,160
- Give a couple to some ladies.
- I see what you're saying, Gibb...

304
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,450
...but that's why you should go.
Be amongst friends where it's safe.

305
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,870
There's gonna be a whole lot of loving
there for you and my boy, Trey.

306
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:13,380
Yeah, you're right. I should go.
I could use a few dozen drinks.

307
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,960
- For sure.
- Attagirl. Let your freak-flag fly.

308
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,710
See you there.

309
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,050
You wanna go?

310
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,970
- What is it?
- No, I don't think so.

311
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,340
- Why?
- I didn't get much sleep last night.

312
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:26,680
And when I did sleep,
I had the most terrible nightmares.

313
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:30,230
Lori, you had to sleep at a police station.
I'd have nightmares too.

314
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:33,770
No, no, no, it wasn't like that.
I mean, this was really real.

315
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:37,480
I mean, there was this man,
but he was more like a monster really.

316
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:40,450
And they kept calling him Freddy,
and he was so real.

317
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:42,200
Shh. What did he look like?

318
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,870
He had this dark-brown hat...

319
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,080
...and his skin was terribly burned.

320
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:53,080
And then on his right hand he had,
like, these razor fingers, and--

321
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,250
- You must be tripping.
- No, no, no.

322
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:59,050
- And then there was these little girls--
- It's okay, it was a bad dream.

323
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,550
They were singing like this song, like--

324
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,850
<i>One, two, Freddy's coming for you</i>

325
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,720
You know why they sing that?

326
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,430
Because that's when he comes for you.

327
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,360
In your dreams. You're lucky to be alive.

328
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,610
Who is he?

329
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:20,940
He's a child murderer that some parents
from around here burned alive.

330
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,780
- Then he came back.
- Oh, shit.

331
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:26,320
Back for revenge in our nightmares.

332
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:29,120
- Funny no one ever told us about it.
- Okay, thank you.

333
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:32,120
You want some free advice? Coffee.
Make friends with it.

334
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:35,380
Mark. That's enough.

335
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:37,960
You're scaring her.

336
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,130
Will?

337
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,310
I thought you might be in trouble, so--

338
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,730
Lori. Oh, my God, Lori.
Lori, honey, wake up.

339
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:58,520
Someone get help, please.
Someone just get me--

340
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:00,780
- Someone get some help.
- Will, the principal.

341
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,570
- Get me some help.
- Bro, let's go.

342
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,900
Are you okay?

343
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,660
Please, somebody help her. Lori.

344
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,170
How much longer is it gonna take?
Is she okay or what?

345
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,740
For nose jobs, what kind of anesthesia
do the doctor's use?

346
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,490
They put you all the way under, right?

347
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,550
Got your nose.

348
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,340
Ah!

349
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,140
Strong work, man.

350
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:17,730
I came to make sure she's okay,
and you put her in the infirmary.

351
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,400
- And you're facilitating?
- Exactly, we'll go back to my office.

352
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,690
What were you thinking about
telling her all that stuff, man?

353
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,900
We're not in groups.

354
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:29,240
I'm thinking for the first time in my life
that maybe I'm not crazy.

355
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,830
That my brother wasn't crazy.
She had the same dream, Will.

356
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,700
Will Rollins. Mark Davis.

357
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,920
This doesn't make any sense.
There's nothing on Krueger.

358
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:50,840
Not his arrest, his death,
not even a birth certificate.

359
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:53,720
Whole sections of the records are gone.

360
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:56,850
Look at all these blacked-out obituaries.

361
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:07,610
January 18th.

362
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,030
That's the day
my brother committed suicide.

363
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,410
Why isn't that in here?

364
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,120
I don't know.

365
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,790
But I'm sure there's a good reason.

366
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:23,630
Remember in group when they told us
not to jump to conclusions?

367
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:26,630
Listen to yourself.
You're holding on to that psychobabble...

368
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,340
...like it's some kind of security blanket,
man.

369
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:32,970
Let it go. They covered him up, Will.

370
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:36,430
They never told us about Freddy.
That's how they decided to beat him.

371
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,140
They treated him
like he was a fucking disease.

372
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:43,100
They locked up kids who made contact
with him so they wouldn't infect the others.

373
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:46,190
- That's crazy.
- Is it?

374
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:51,450
How come we were never allowed
to call any of our friends, man?

375
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:54,160
How come none of our friends
ever called us?

376
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:59,750
We were in a fucking quarantine, man.
That's what Westin Hills was for.

377
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:04,540
Well, even if all you're saying is true,
then why didn't Freddy kill Lori?

378
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:07,130
Maybe he's not strong enough yet.

379
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,840
My brother said it's our fear
that gives him his power.

380
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:13,760
Yeah, well, you sure as hell
spread enough fear today at school.

381
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,800
Holy shit.

382
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:24,560
You're right, they wanted to forget Freddy
so they wouldn't fear him, that's--

383
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:29,480
- What if I screwed up the town's plan?
- No.

384
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:32,190
Fuck. This fucker's gonna spread
like the plague, man.

385
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,200
Kids are gonna start falling asleep.
It's go--

386
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,910
- Let's leave, let's leave.
- No, I can't leave.

387
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,160
- Why not?
- I gotta go talk to Lori.

388
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:42,960
- I gotta see if she's okay.
- Is she worth dying for?

389
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,120
Because if you sleep,
you ain't waking up.

390
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:48,040
Yeah, well, if that's the case,
how come you're not dead?

391
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:52,720
Or any of the freaks at Westin, huh?
When's the last time you had a nightmare?

392
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:56,390
I don't know.
I can't remember my dreams anymore.

393
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,930
Look, just give me one night, okay?

394
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,520
Just let me find Lori,
and then we're out of here.

395
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,520
I swear.

396
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:13,740
All right, but if your ass isn't back here
by dawn, I'm gone. We clear on that?

397
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:18,570
This baby's my brother's pride and joy,
so be careful.

398
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,400
- Oh, shit.
- Linderman.

399
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,450
Shack, I don't drink.

400
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,170
Hi, Lori.

401
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:20,550
I didn't think I'd see you here.
Can I get you something to drink?

402
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,640
Oh, smooth opening, but you know,
we're already taken care of.

403
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:26,980
What happened to your clothes?

404
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:29,190
Oh, this?

405
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:33,770
I was playing a drinking game
with some of the lower primates.

406
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:37,610
I guess I'm penalized for my ability
to read above a fourth-grade level.

407
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:41,070
Linderman, you know, I always pictured you
as a straight-up bed-wetter.

408
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:44,790
You know what, Kia?
I used to think you hated me...

409
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:47,830
...because I wasn't good enough for Lori.
But that's not it.

410
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,500
You tear me down to make yourself feel
better because you hate yourself.

411
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:54,000
Which is pathetic when you stop
and think about it.

412
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:58,420
Assuming, of course, you can think with
all that makeup weighing down your head.

413
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:07,810
Cops said Blake committed suicide.
Apparently, it was grief over Trey.

414
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,900
No, that's bullshit.
I heard some guy Krueger killed them both.

415
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,270
I said his name to my parents,
they almost shit.

416
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,820
Yeah, I heard that Freddy freak
used to live here.

417
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,110
Fucking gutted Trey
like a goddamn turkey, man.

418
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,950
Like, I heard his intestines and shit
were just on the floor.

419
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,950
Oh, shit. Yeah, I'm sorry.

420
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,790
Oh, my God.

421
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,790
Look who's here. Look who's here.

422
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:46,510
What are you looking at?
Come on, come on, let's dance.

423
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,140
Come on, Linderman, let's go.

424
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:51,190
Where have you been, Will?

425
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:54,360
- Didn't you get my letters?
- What letters?

426
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,730
They must have never even mailed them.

427
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,570
Who?

428
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,410
The doctors at Westin Hills.

429
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,950
I've been in a psychiatric hospital.

430
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,920
Mark was with me there,
and some other kids too.

431
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,790
I don't understand.

432
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,720
Well, I saw on news the other night,
that kid that was killed at your house, I'm--

433
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:25,800
I needed to know that you were safe.
What happened?

434
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:29,140
I don't know, I don't know. Nobody knows.
Nobody saw what happened.

435
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:32,940
And the police have been acting really weird
like they know something.

436
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:36,150
And I heard them mention some name.
Some....

437
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,770
Freddy. Freddy Krueger.

438
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,730
Where was your dad?

439
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,530
- Out of town.
- Are you sure?

440
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,870
- What is going on, Will?
- Look, four years ago, I thought I--

441
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:51,620
Enough with this bullshit talk. Let's go
shake our ass on the dance floor. Come on.

442
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:15,060
I'm dead one day, and you're already out
getting shitfaced? Same old Gibb.

443
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:18,810
Trey, I-- I cannot believe you--

444
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,480
Come on. Let's go.

445
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:27,910
Babe, don't make me
ask you twice, okay?

446
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,490
Now!

447
00:37:41,250 --> 00:38:20,420
Trey?

448
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:23,920
Trey.

449
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:36,890
Where's the door? Where's the do--?

450
00:38:38,850 --> 00:39:02,920
Ah!

451
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,260
Help me.

452
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:15,260
Ah!

453
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:24,310
No. No. No.

454
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:34,490
Ah!

455
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,800
You're the one that killed Trey!

456
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:51,680
Don't worry about my little errand boy.

457
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:56,310
The only thing to fear is fear himself.

458
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:59,600
Ah!

459
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,980
Oh.

460
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:20,140
Ah!

461
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:27,150
No!

462
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,400
She's mine. Mine. Mine!

463
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,910
This Everclear is kicking my ass.

464
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:00,640
Check out this fucking guy.

465
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:05,350
Well, hey, Jethro.
This is a rave, not a Halloween party.

466
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,270
Why don't you go find yourself
a pig to fuck?

467
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,780
Yeah, invite only, cornpoke.
And you weren't invi--

468
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,950
Son of a bitch.

469
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:30,250
Yeah. Burn, motherfucker.

470
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,770
No.

471
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:20,590
Run!

472
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,350
Ah!

473
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:35,190
Big stupid mother--

474
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:51,040
Gibb! Oh, my God!

475
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:52,960
- Oh, Gibb, no!
- Come on, let's go.

476
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,460
Let's just go, come on!

477
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:04,390
Was that him?
The guy you were talking about?

478
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:07,100
- Freddy Krueger?
- No. That wasn't the guy in my dream.

479
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,350
That was somebody else.

480
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,180
Who cares about some fucking
dream guy, okay?

481
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:15,520
- That psycho in the hockey mask was real.
- That goalie was pissed about something.

482
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:19,110
- We need to find the police, y'all.
- No, no, fuck the police.

483
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,570
Just take me home, Will.

484
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:32,750
Gibb, I ca--

485
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,370
I can't believe she--

486
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:38,090
I know. I know.

487
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:43,090
Look, call me later, okay? Please.

488
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:46,430
- Just to check in.
- Okay.

489
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:53,440
Bye, Will.

490
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,940
Be careful.

491
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:15,290
Well, I'm gonna go inside now.

492
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,790
No, I think that's the last thing
you should do right now.

493
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,880
Please, after everything that's happened,
I just wanna go home.

494
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:24,470
No, there's more to it than that.

495
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:27,510
Look, I tried to tell you this earlier.

496
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,220
The reason I was sent to Westin...

497
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:34,640
...is because I saw your dad
kill your mom.

498
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:38,400
Will, my mom died in a car accident.

499
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:42,070
No, that's what he wanted you to believe,
but I was there, Lori.

500
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:45,320
<i>I was sneaking up to your room
like I used to do.</i>

501
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,820
<i>Only you weren't there.</i>

502
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:52,240
<i>I saw him kill her.</i>

503
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,870
- Dad.
- Get out of the van.

504
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,170
- Get out of the van!
- Dad, what are you doing?

505
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:00,420
- I've been looking all over for you.
- Stop it.

506
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:03,260
- Get away from her.
- You're in a hell of a lot of trouble.

507
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,840
- Yeah, like I give a shit anymore.
- Get in the house.

508
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:09,340
- I'm taking you back to Westin.
- No, no way. You can't trust him, Lori.

509
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:12,060
- Whatever you do, don't go home with him.
- Will, what--?

510
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:15,020
No, listen to me, Lori.
He was the one who had me committed.

511
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:17,940
You didn't understand, you still don't.
You were confused.

512
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:20,520
- Stop it, both of you, stop it!
Get-- Lori--

513
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:24,110
Damn it, Will. I am not gonna let you
endanger my daughter again.

514
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,490
- Stop it!
- Not after everything that's happened.

515
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:28,700
Stop it! Stop it! Fuck!

516
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:32,700
Lori. Lori.

517
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,370
Lori, Lori.

518
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,380
Did Mom die in a car accident?

519
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,300
- Yes. Of course she did.
- Prove it.

520
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:49,050
Show me a death certificate.
Show me an autopsy report.

521
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:51,720
Lori, I don't think now is the right time--

522
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:54,220
Really, Dad?
Because I think it's the perfect time.

523
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:57,060
Why didn't you tell me about Westin Hills?
You work there?

524
00:46:57,230 --> 00:46:59,600
Because I thought
you were a general practitioner.

525
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:01,610
Yes, I--

526
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:06,230
I do some consulting there now,
but it isn't what you think.

527
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:09,400
Oh, my God.

528
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:12,820
So you knew about Will this whole time?

529
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:16,330
Lori, listen to me.

530
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,330
You're upset. We both are.

531
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:25,920
Now, I think what you need now
more than anything is to get some rest.

532
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:28,880
Why don't I give you some pills?
That'll help you sleep.

533
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:31,590
And then we'll talk about it
in the morning.

534
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:35,560
I don't wanna sleep, Dad. I wanna know
why you've been lying to me.

535
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:38,770
We'll talk about it in the morning.
Now do what I say.

536
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,310
Lori. Lori.

537
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:43,360
Lori.

538
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:47,070
Open this door. Open this door.

539
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,860
- Go away.
- Damn it, Lori, let me in.

540
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:52,530
Lori.

541
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:59,040
Goddamn it.

542
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,380
Lori.

543
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:22,520
- Ah!
- It's okay. It's me, it's me. Shh. Shh.

544
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:27,570
Okay? Okay, it's me, it's just me.
Come on, it's me, okay?

545
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:33,240
I don't know how your father's connected
to all this. But I think Mark was right.

546
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:37,160
There's some kind of cover-up
going on here with Krueger.

547
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:40,910
We can't trust the police.

548
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:44,290
We can't trust any of the adults.

549
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,090
So, what do we do?

550
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:49,840
We gotta get to Mark.

551
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,840
He's the expert in all this.
He'll know what's going on.

552
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:06,690
You always looked out for me, bro.

553
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:10,110
<i>Hey, Mark.</i>

554
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:48,230
I gotta stay awake.

555
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:12,340
Shit.

556
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:20,390
Hey, Mark.

557
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,600
- You didn't forget about me, did you?
- Oh, God.

558
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:26,600
Oh, that's right. Everyone forgot.

559
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:29,100
- That's why they weren't afraid.
- I'm dreaming.

560
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:33,190
That's why I needed Jason to kill for me
to get them to remember.

561
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:38,450
But now he just won't stop.
That hockey puck.

562
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:48,710
This isn't real.

563
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:55,420
Somebody please wake me up!

564
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:56,970
Please!

565
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:10,650
Mark. Mark, wake up!

566
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:16,900
I need you to send a little message
for me, that's all. Just a little message.

567
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,820
I'm not gonna do it.

568
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,490
I won't do it!

569
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,370
No?

570
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,410
I won't do it.

571
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:39,340
I'll have to pass that message myself,
won't I?

572
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,390
Ah!

573
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:47,810
Oh, my God!

574
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,520
Wake up!

575
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:57,110
- Help me.
- Mark.

576
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,210
<i>Pass on a little message for me, will you?</i>

577
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:28,060
Sheriff, look, I've been compiling info
based on eye-witness reports...

578
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:31,390
- ...of the hockey-mask killer--
- We already know who did this.

579
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:35,020
Sheriff, we closed down the school
and set up a curfew for anyone under 18.

580
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:38,900
Good. I want 24-hour roadblocks set up.
Nobody leaves town, nobody gets in.

581
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:41,740
Contain the son of a bitch
before he spreads any further.

582
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,320
Yes, sir.

583
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:48,410
- Sir, shouldn't we have the FBI come in--?
- No outsiders, Stubbs.

584
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:51,040
We can handle this.
We've stopped him before.

585
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:54,710
Okay, I'm a little lost here.
Stopped who before?

586
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,420
We don't say his name out loud.

587
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,380
You're not from here,
I don't expect you to understand.

588
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:03,760
With all respect,
I think we have a copycat...

589
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,340
...of the Jason Voorhees
Crystal Lake killer on our--

590
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:10,600
You listen to me. We do things around here
a certain way for a reason.

591
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,930
And that's given us four years of peace.

592
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:15,400
So either do your job
and keep your mouth shut...

593
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:19,440
...or so help me God, I will lock you up.
Do you understand me?

594
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:21,780
Do you understand?

595
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:24,200
Yes, sir.

596
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,330
Why don't we all just leave?

597
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:41,170
No, even if we leave,
Freddy can still get us.

598
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:45,010
I mean, we all know about him.
We're all afraid of him.

599
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:51,010
It was our fear that gave him his power.

600
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:53,560
And we're marked now.

601
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:55,940
Man, screw that clown.

602
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:59,270
I mean, what kind of pussy
comes after you in your dreams, anyway?

603
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,190
Now, that big-ass motherfucker
back at the cornfield...

604
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:06,610
...that's who we should be afraid of.
Tell me who the fuck that was.

605
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:09,370
His name was Jason Voorhees.

606
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:11,410
Shit, man.

607
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:14,330
How'd you know we were here?

608
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:19,500
Nothing personal, but the Scooby van
out back wasn't exactly subtle.

609
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:21,380
And never keep your keys in the door.

610
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:24,010
Great. So now we're completely fucked.

611
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:27,880
No, you're not. I'm here to help you.

612
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,350
Now, this Jason Voorhees
supposedly drowned...

613
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:35,680
...at Camp Crystal Lake back in 1957
when he was 11 years old.

614
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:38,190
The counselors weren't watching him.

615
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:41,360
Then they made the mistake
of killing his mother.

616
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:45,230
And the legend has it, is that Jason
kept returning from his grave...

617
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,990
...to punish whoever returned
to the camp.

618
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:51,950
- I think we're dealing with a copycat here.
- No, no, no.

619
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:55,700
He's not a copycat. I've seen
what he can do. He's the real Jason.

620
00:54:55,870 --> 00:54:58,040
That's impossible, Linderman.
Jason is dead.

621
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:01,380
Yeah, well, you better start thinking
outside your little box, dude.

622
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:04,840
Because somebody's definitely breaking
the fucking reality rules, okay?

623
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:10,010
It makes sense in a way. I mean,
what if Freddy brought Jason back...

624
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:14,560
...because he was too weak to go after us
on his own, so he used Jason.

625
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:18,560
I mean, he knew that we'd think it was him,
that we'd spread the fear again.

626
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:23,190
And now that it's working,
it's like he can't shut Jason back down.

627
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,990
Wait a minute.
Freddy died by fire, Jason by water.

628
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:28,570
How can we use that?

629
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:32,070
I think we should concentrate
on Jason first.

630
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,240
I thought we decided
that Freddy was the one pulling the strings.

631
00:55:35,410 --> 00:55:37,660
Shouldn't we go after him first?

632
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:42,880
I don't know, maybe what we need to do
is to offer Freddy a sacrifice.

633
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:48,210
Yeah. Yeah, totally.
Like a virgin, right? Someone pure.

634
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,720
Dude, don't look at me.

635
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:58,520
Even if you pay for it, it still counts.

636
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:03,440
Oh, come on.
Look, we all know who real virgin is here.

637
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:06,110
- Kia.
- Oh, come on, Lori.

638
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,940
I know you never made it with Will.

639
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:13,280
Why would he want to,
when he can fuck somebody like me?

640
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:20,830
Let's tie the bitch up.

641
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,790
What?

642
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:31,130
Don't worry, angel, you've still got me.

643
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:33,800
Come on, give daddy a kiss.

644
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:36,010
Ah!

645
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:42,140
Your eyes say, "No, no."

646
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:46,440
But my mouth says, "Yes, yes."

647
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:50,990
Ah!

648
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:52,450
- Lori, you all right?
- Lori.

649
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:55,410
You fell asleep. God.

650
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,170
Oh, shit.

651
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:10,000
I pulled that out of my dream.

652
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:13,800
- All right, how is that possible?
- Anything is possible now.

653
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:15,430
God, you just don't get it.

654
00:57:15,590 --> 00:57:19,510
Oh, God, y'all, two killers.
We're not safe awake or asleep.

655
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,350
It's not sleep that's killing us,
it's our dreams.

656
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:25,100
At Westin, Mark and I never had dreams.

657
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:27,310
Were you on any drugs?

658
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:30,320
Yeah. But there's something
called Hypnocil.

659
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:34,490
They never told us what it was for
but everyone there was taking it.

660
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:38,370
"Hypnocil. Experimental drug...."

661
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:42,200
- Not even approved yet by the FDA.
- Oh, shit.

662
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:46,370
"Used for the suppression of dreams."

663
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:50,130
We need those pills. Enough for all of us.

664
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,300
Can you get us back to Westin Hills?

665
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:15,240
All right, this isn't it, guys.
Come on, let's go.

666
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:18,410
Hey, dude, dude, dude.
Let's take a little J break, huh?

667
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:22,410
- No, man. He's a cop.
- Come on, what is he gonna do? Arrest me?

668
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:23,700
Yeah. Hold up--

669
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:27,540
Hang on a sec. Fuck.

670
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:38,260
Oh, that's better.

671
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:55,400
Where's Freeburg?

672
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:56,740
Come on. Come on.

673
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:18,420
This is D wing. These are the ones
who wouldn't stop dreaming.

674
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:27,640
Are they dead?

675
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:33,940
They're in a coma.

676
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:37,440
Says they were given too much Hypnocil.

677
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,110
Who would do this to people?

678
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:44,330
Your dad's name is at the bottom
of both of these charts.

679
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,540
Yeah.

680
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:07,430
What the fuck?

681
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:22,660
Nice.

682
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:38,300
Hold up, man.

683
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,060
What?

684
01:00:57,650 --> 01:00:59,440
What do you want?

685
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:05,320
No. I don't know
where the Hypnocil is, okay?

686
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:19,880
I can't pour these down the drain.
We need this stuff.

687
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:28,760
Ah!

688
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:37,860
Freeburg!

689
01:01:39,610 --> 01:01:42,780
Freeburg. Freeburg, what are you doing?
We need those drugs.

690
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:46,280
Dude, no. Dude-- Ah!

691
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,460
Go on! Get out of here, go!

692
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:01,380
Ah!

693
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:12,810
What was that?

694
01:02:15,850 --> 01:02:17,310
Let's go check it out. Let's go.

695
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:22,820
Die! Shit! Help!

696
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:25,820
Fucker! Help me!

697
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,670
- Shit, they're all empty.
- We gotta keep looking.

698
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:49,510
- Maybe there's some down here.
- Damn, there's gotta be here somewhere.

699
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:02,310
- Freeburg, come on. Come on.
- Come on.

700
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,530
What are you waiting for? Come on.

701
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:09,200
Freeburg, time to go.
We gotta go. Now! Come on!

702
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:12,030
Let me handle this, bitch.

703
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:13,490
What?

704
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:18,160
Come on. Come on, man. Let's go.

705
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:21,710
- Let's go.
- Will, wait, wait. Look.

706
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:26,880
Come to Freddy.

707
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,970
These are my children, Jason.

708
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,510
Go back where you belong.

709
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,440
Oh, God.

710
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:46,730
Fuck you.

711
01:03:48,990 --> 01:03:50,400
Linderman.

712
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:55,280
<i>These are my children, Jason.</i>

713
01:03:55,870 --> 01:03:58,500
<i>Go back where you belong.</i>

714
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:12,380
<i>Jason.</i>

715
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:17,720
<i>Jason, my special, special boy.</i>

716
01:04:22,270 --> 01:04:26,400
I'm disappointed in you, Jason.
You disobeyed me.

717
01:04:26,570 --> 01:04:29,990
You were supposed to come back home.
Just kill a few of them.

718
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:34,910
But I blame myself. I should have known
you wouldn't be able to stop killing.

719
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:39,410
You are like a big stupid dog
who can't stop eating...

720
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:43,960
...even though your master said
you've had enough!

721
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:55,890
Now, it's time
to put this bad dog to sleep.

722
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:58,970
For good.

723
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:00,600
Ha!

724
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,810
Not my arm.

725
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:35,470
Welcome to my nightmare.

726
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:57,780
Penny for your thoughts, chief.

727
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:01,790
Oh, scary.

728
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,220
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

729
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:21,560
Oh.

730
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:23,720
Tilt.

731
01:06:46,830 --> 01:06:48,750
Why won't you die?

732
01:07:14,610 --> 01:07:16,570
Come on. Come on.

733
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:33,790
Ah.

734
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:38,130
So you are afraid of something
after all, huh?

735
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:51,060
How in the fuck did I let
y'all talk me into this?

736
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:55,150
Why don't we try and do it here?
Why go all the way to Crystal Lake?

737
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,740
Best-case scenario, Jason wins.

738
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:00,070
He'll already be home,
back where he belongs.

739
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:03,070
- I mean, why follow us anymore?
- And if Freddy wins?

740
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,120
At least Jason has home-field advantage.

741
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:32,310
<i>Aw.</i>

742
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:34,610
How sweet.

743
01:08:35,690 --> 01:08:38,030
You ugly little shit.

744
01:08:38,190 --> 01:08:43,410
Now, there's a face
only a mother could love.

745
01:08:45,530 --> 01:08:48,200
Yeah. Now we're getting somewhere.

746
01:08:48,870 --> 01:08:50,870
Let's see what really scares you.

747
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:52,540
Oh.

748
01:08:58,050 --> 01:09:00,840
And dig a little deeper.

749
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:34,920
<i>I'm dying to see what skeletons
are hidden in your closet.</i>

750
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:57,350
We're seriously running out of tranq here.
I got maybe one dose, plus enough for Lori.

751
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:58,610
We're almost there.

752
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:01,360
- Then I better get going.
- No, no, no. Just....

753
01:10:06,570 --> 01:10:09,200
- I don't want you to go.
- I'm coming back.

754
01:10:09,370 --> 01:10:11,950
Just give me 15 minutes,
then wake me up.

755
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:14,410
I'll bring that bastard Freddy
back through.

756
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:17,040
Just make sure Jason's waiting for him.

757
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:24,800
Now I lay me down to sleep.

758
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:46,320
Get him.

759
01:10:46,990 --> 01:10:50,660
Freak show, freak show, freak show.

760
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:52,660
Bulls'-eye.

761
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:56,290
I want him out of here.
Get him out of here.

762
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:58,500
Freak show, freak show, freak show.

763
01:10:58,670 --> 01:11:00,670
Try this on.

764
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:04,090
Freak show, freak show, freak show.

765
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:09,180
Stop it.

766
01:11:12,850 --> 01:11:14,720
Aren't you gonna help the kid?

767
01:11:14,890 --> 01:11:17,270
Can't you see I'm busy here?

768
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,810
You mean you're not coming?

769
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,940
It's not my fault
this bitch is dead on her feet.

770
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:37,450
- It's been five minutes.
- That was the last of the tranq. We're out.

771
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:40,290
Calm down, okay? Just relax.

772
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:55,220
Help!

773
01:11:56,430 --> 01:11:58,890
Wait! Give me your hand!

774
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:01,730
Give me your hand!

775
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:05,400
- Help!
- Jason?

776
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:06,650
Ah!

777
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:09,190
Jason Voorhees!

778
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,570
Ah!

779
01:12:19,370 --> 01:12:21,750
Y'all? Y'all? Something's wrong.

780
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,380
- It's like he's drowning.
- Shit.

781
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:25,750
- Freddy must be killing him.
- We need him alive!

782
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:30,090
Dude, what do you want me to do?
Give him mouth-to-mouth or something?

783
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:41,440
Hell, no. Why you--?
No. No, I'm not gonna do that, no.

784
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:44,440
Kia, I would do it myself,
but I've had asthma since I was 6.

785
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:46,060
I don't have the lung power.

786
01:12:47,690 --> 01:12:49,820
Kia, he has asthma.

787
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:51,280
Oh...

788
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:56,580
Look, you can do this, okay?
You can do this. You just--

789
01:12:56,740 --> 01:13:00,250
Shut up. You're not the one
that has to do this.

790
01:13:00,410 --> 01:13:02,910
- I know, but I--
- Shut up.

791
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:05,460
Ah!

792
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:08,920
Oh, my God. I don't wanna do this.

793
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:12,300
- You can do this.
- Oh, God.

794
01:13:17,890 --> 01:13:19,220
Oh, man.

795
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:21,310
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

796
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:48,000
- You.
- Ah!

797
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:03,980
What's wrong, Lori?

798
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,650
Miss your wake-up call?

799
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:10,650
Wake me up! I got him! I got him!

800
01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:17,860
No!

801
01:14:18,030 --> 01:14:19,530
- Come on, wake up. Wake up.
- Lori.

802
01:14:20,910 --> 01:14:22,410
- Look.
- Lori.

803
01:14:22,580 --> 01:14:23,620
Guys, look.

804
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:26,370
We're almost there.

805
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:29,500
Let's go. Come on. Help me get her up.

806
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:32,550
- All right.
- Come on. Start running. Let's go.

807
01:14:32,710 --> 01:14:35,050
Wake me up!

808
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:37,880
Daddy, don't!

809
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:07,160
Daddy! No, Daddy, don't!

810
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:08,710
Freddy. It was you.

811
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:13,670
I've always had a thing for the whores
that live in this house.

812
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:15,210
Ah!

813
01:15:23,930 --> 01:15:25,850
Lori, wake up!

814
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:29,100
Oh, shit.

815
01:15:34,230 --> 01:15:37,110
- It's him. He's here.
- Lori, come on, you gotta wake up.

816
01:15:42,030 --> 01:15:43,450
Oh, yeah.

817
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:50,290
Oh, my God.

818
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:55,960
No, no, no. Come on. Lori, wake up!
Lori, please, wake up!

819
01:15:56,130 --> 01:15:57,630
Lori, please. Lori, please.

820
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:05,640
Go, go, go.

821
01:16:05,810 --> 01:16:07,180
Ah!

822
01:16:08,310 --> 01:16:09,480
Lori.

823
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:17,900
Oh, you fucking asshole. Goddamn it.

824
01:16:21,990 --> 01:16:25,660
Welcome to my world, bitch.

825
01:16:27,410 --> 01:16:30,120
I should warn you, princess.

826
01:16:30,290 --> 01:16:35,500
The first time tends to get a little messy.

827
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:49,850
Ah!

828
01:16:52,690 --> 01:16:53,940
Get away from her!

829
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:03,280
Linderman.

830
01:17:10,450 --> 01:17:12,120
Oh, no.

831
01:17:18,670 --> 01:17:21,210
Die, you little bitch.

832
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:48,740
Oh!

833
01:18:08,430 --> 01:18:09,890
Ah!

834
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,810
Jesus, Linderman, you're really hurt.

835
01:18:17,980 --> 01:18:22,190
No, no, no. Don't worry about me.
It's just a scratch. Just go get help, okay?

836
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:25,490
- What?
- I'm just gonna rest here a minute--

837
01:18:25,650 --> 01:18:28,200
- But Linderman--
- I'm fine, Kia.

838
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:31,620
- Really. Now, get out of here. Go get help.
- But you-- You--

839
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:32,870
Just go.

840
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:37,460
Okay, okay. But I'm gonna
be back as soon as I can.

841
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:21,840
- Lori.
- Think you're so smart, huh, bitch?

842
01:19:22,670 --> 01:19:24,170
Freddy!

843
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:37,480
How sweet, dark meat.

844
01:19:37,890 --> 01:19:40,230
- No! Kia!
- Let's go. Now.

845
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:41,860
No!

846
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:44,860
So you're the one
everyone's afraid of?

847
01:19:46,530 --> 01:19:48,530
Tell me something.

848
01:19:48,990 --> 01:19:52,910
What kind of faggot runs around
in a Christmas sweater?

849
01:19:54,450 --> 01:19:58,370
I mean, come on, get real.
You're not even scary.

850
01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:00,170
You're not even scary.

851
01:20:01,420 --> 01:20:05,880
And let's talk about the butter knives.
What is with the butter knives?

852
01:20:06,050 --> 01:20:08,720
You trying to compensate
for something?

853
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:13,550
Maybe coming up a little short there
between the legs, Mr. Krueger?

854
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:18,350
I mean, you got
these teensy-weensy little things...

855
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:22,400
...and Jason has got
this big old thing and like--

856
01:20:30,530 --> 01:20:31,570
Oh.

857
01:20:32,570 --> 01:20:33,910
Kia!

858
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:36,580
Come on.

859
01:20:41,330 --> 01:20:44,880
- Let's go, we can't help her anymore.
- No, I'm staying.

860
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:49,300
Are you crazy? You got what you wanted,
you pulled Freddy out. He's fighting Jason.

861
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:52,590
- Come on, what more do you want?
- He killed my mother, Will.

862
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:55,600
It was Freddy.
My dad covered it up to protect me.

863
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,220
- He didn't do it.
- Oh, my God.

864
01:20:57,390 --> 01:21:01,100
Look, he has taken everything from us.
He has ruined both of our pasts.

865
01:21:01,270 --> 01:21:04,600
And I am not leaving until
I see him die.

866
01:21:33,470 --> 01:21:35,220
Man the torpedoes.

867
01:21:59,490 --> 01:22:00,990
Hey, asshole.

868
01:22:02,660 --> 01:22:04,660
Up here.

869
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:12,420
Aha.

870
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:30,360
Yeah.

871
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:43,540
Oh, give me a break.

872
01:22:53,340 --> 01:23:06,020
Ah!

873
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:13,480
Oh, no. Oh, no!

874
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:40,650
Lori, get the tanks.

875
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:48,620
You can dish it out,
but you can't take it.

876
01:25:13,690 --> 01:25:15,310
Freddy!

877
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,360
Go to hell!

878
01:25:50,470 --> 01:25:51,470
Ah!

879
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:09,260
It's okay. It's okay.

880
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:41,580
You--

881
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:42,840
Ah!

882
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:15,530
Welcome to my world, bitch!
