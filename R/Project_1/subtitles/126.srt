00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,451
These are dry. You need them.

191
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:54,742
Thank you!
Here.

192
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,871
Oi! Give me one of them!

193
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,289
I'll take my death   

194
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,540
   in this cold!

195
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:00,792
Aw, find your own!

196
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,877
You're not in charge now,
Alfrid Lickspittle.

197
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,253
Well, you are wrong!

198
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,255
In the absence of the Master   

199
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,465
   the power cedes to his deputy,  

200
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,759
   which in this instance is my good self.

201
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,678
So give me that blanket!

202
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:12,929
[grunting]

203
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,764
Master's deputy!!?

204
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,641
Don't make me laugh!

205
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:17,976
You're a sneak-thief.

206
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,519
More like I'll be dead before   

207
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,895
   I answer to the likes of you.

208
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,439
Maybe, that can be arranged.

209
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:31,531
I wouldn't go turning on your own, Alfrid,
not now.

210
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,492
[grunts]

211
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,705
Da!!
Come here!

212
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,081
You're alive!

213
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,541
[Bard laughing]

214
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,167
Oh! Oh! Oh! It's alright, darling.

215
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,381
It was Bard, he killed the dragon!

216
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,842
I saw it with me own eyes.

217
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,343
He brought the beast down!

218
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:53,594
Shot him dead   

219
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,929
   with a Black Arrow.

220
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,723
[cheering]

221
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,433
Thank you, Bard!

222
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,101
Good man.
Thank you!

223
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,188
You've saved us all!

224
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,648
Bless you.

225
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:11,112
All hail to the dragon slayer!

226
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:12,905
Long live   

227
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,824
   King Bard!

228
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,578
I have said it many times,

229
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,998
this is a man of noble stock.

230
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,375
A born leader!
Do not call me that!

231
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,127
I'm not the Master   

232
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,295
   of this town.

233
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,422
Where is he?

234
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,884
Where's the Master?
Halfway down the Anduin!

235
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,344
With all our coins, not a doubt!

236
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,721
You know!!

237
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,057
You helped him empty   

238
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,184
    the treasury!!
No!!

239
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,560
I tried to stop it.

240
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:43,811
Liar! (chattering, yelling)
Cheat!

241
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,730
You're a mongrel!

242
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,648
I begged. I pleaded.

243
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,109
Away with him!

244
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,861
Tar him!
I said, "Master   

245
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,446
   no!

246
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,156
[shouting]

247
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,201
Think of the children."

248
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,452
Hang him!

249
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,580
"Will nobody think of the children?"

250
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,540
Ow!
(yelling, shouting)

251
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,085
To the tree with him!

252
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,215
[Alfrid screaming]

253
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,266
Hang him hard!
Take him down!

254
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,178
Enough! Let him go!
(yelling, shouting)

255
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,513
Enough!   Let him go!

256
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,681
[Alfrid thuds]

257
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,309
Look around you!

258
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,436
Have you not   

259
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,271
   had your fill of death?

260
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,774
[Alfrid grunts and thuds]

261
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,734
Winter is upon us.

262
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,403
We must look to our own,

263
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:37,448
to the sick and the helpless.

264
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,493
Those who can stand, tend to the wounded,

265
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,245
and those who have strength left, follow me!

266
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,539
We must salvage what we can.

267
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,207
And what then, what do we do then?

268
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,547
We find shelter.

269
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,010
Hello!

270
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,305
Bombur?

271
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,724
Bifur?

272
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,226
Anybody?

273
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,152
Wait!

274
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,820
Wait!

275
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:58,988
It's Bilbo!
He's alive!

276
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,865
Stop! Stop!

277
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,325
Stop!

278
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:03,826
We need to leave,

279
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,494
we all need to leave!

280
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,246
We all just got here!

281
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,332
I tried talking to him but he won't listen.

282
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,292
Now, what do you mean, laddie?
THORIN,     Thorin.

283
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,253
Thorin! He's been out there again.

284
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,297
He doesn't sleep, he barely eats.

285
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,634
He's not been himself, not at all.

286
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,595
It's this, it's this place.
I think a sickness lies on it.

287
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:23,971
Sickness?

288
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,390
What kind of sickness?

289
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:29,810
Fili.

290
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,062
Fili!

291
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,897
Fili!

292
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,303
Gold!

293
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,016
Gold! (Dwarvish word)

294
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,187
Beyond sorrow   

295
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,314
   and grief!

296
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,489
Behold   

297
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:24,991
   the great   

298
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:28,661
   treasure hoard of Thror!

299
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,545
Welcome   

300
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,256
   my sister sons   

301
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,761
   to the Kingdom   

302
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:48,723
   of Erebor!

303
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,227
Balin!

304
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,105
[all laughing]

305
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:57,857
Kili!

306
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,901
Thank Durin, you're alive!

307
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,154
Bombur!

308
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:04,739
You're alive!

309
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,410
Any sign of it?
Nothing yet.

310
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:10,745
Nothing here.

311
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,414
Keep searching!
That jewel could be anywhere.

312
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,750
The Arkenstone is in these halls.

313
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,293
Find it!
You heard him.

314
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,628
We have to keep looking.
All of you!

315
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,048
No one rests until   

316
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,382
   it is found.

317
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,539
"<i>I am almost tempted</i>   

318
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,125
   <i>to let you take it.</i>"

319
00:22:59,169 --> 00:22:59,835
"<i>If only</i>   

320
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,796
   <i>to see Oakenshield</i>   

321
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,255
   <i>suffer.</i>"

322
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:05,508
"<i>Watch it</i>      

323
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,218
   <i>destroy him;</i>

   <i>his heart</i>

   <i>and drive him mad!</i>"

327
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,171
I've got you.
Let's go.

328
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,427
Take only what you need.

329
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,679
We have a long march ahead.

330
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,431
Where will you go?

331
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:57,143
There is only one place.

332
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:01,939
The Mountain.

333
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,608
You are a genius, Sire.

334
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,653
We can take refuge inside the Mountain.

335
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:10,990
It must smell of dragon.
The women can clean up.

336
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,534
It will be safe and warm and dry   

337
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,244
   full of stores,   

338
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,329
   bedding, clothing   

339
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,874
   and a bit of gold.

340
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,544
What gold is in that Mountain is cursed.

341
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,838
We will take only
what was promised to us.

342
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,548
Only what we need to rebuild   

343
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:28,799
   our lives.

344
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:32,344
Here, pull your weight.

345
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:36,056
News of the death of Smaug
will have spread through the lands.

346
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,017
Aye.

347
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,855
Others will now look to the Mountain   

348
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,233
   for its wealth,   

349
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:47,902
   for its position.

350
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,570
What is it you know?

351
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,323
Nothing for certain.

352
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,576
It's what I fear may come.

353
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,673


354
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,220


355
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,080
You saw something out there.

356
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:10,150
The Orc I pursued out of Laketown,
I know who he is.

357
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,612
Bolg, spawn of Azog the Defiler.

358
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,949
A Warg pack was waiting for him
on the outskirts of Esgaroth.

359
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,659
They fled into the North.

360
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,828
These Orcs were different
from the others.

361
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,372
They bore a mark I have not seen 
for a long time.

362
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,165
The mark of Gundabad.

363
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,500
Gundabad?

364
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:27,751
An Orc stronghold   

365
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,004
   in the far North of the Misty Mountains.

366
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,255


367
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,012


368
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,771
You may tell my father   

369
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:51,150
   if there is no place for Tauriel,
there is no place for me.

370
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,069
Legolas,

371
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,822
this is your King's command.

372
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,782


373
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,538
I ride North. Will you come with me?

374
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:05,789
To where?

375
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,291
To Gundabad.

376
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:35,778
[whisperings, mutterings]

377
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,163
[mumbling]

378
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,389
[growls]

379
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,810


380
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,861


381
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,624
[snarls]

382
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,043
I come for Mithrandir   

383
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,714
   and I will leave with him.

384
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,762
If you try to stop me   

385
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,431
   I will destroy you.

386
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:28,682
[roars]

387
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,315
[grunts]

388
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,787


389
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:01,632
Nine   

390
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:05,093
   for mortal men doomed to die.

391
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:30,744


392
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:43,257
I am not alone.

393
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,688
Are you in need of assistance, my lady?

394
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,565
[snarling]

395
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,069
You should have stayed   

396
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,362
   dead.

397
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:08,156
[all grunting]

398
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:33,640
Mithrandir,   

399
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,393
   come back.

400
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,313
[grunting]

401
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,458
[gasping]

402
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,591
H- He is here.

403
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:09,927
Yes,

404
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,471
the darkness has returned.

405
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,355
Go on!

406
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,485
Gandalf!

407
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:29,947
Gandalf!

408
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,198
Climb on!

409
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,033
He is weak,

410
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:36,787
he cannot remain here,
it is draining his life.

411
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:41,750
Go!

412
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,001
Quickly!

413
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,338
Come with me, my lady.

414
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,099
[in deep voice]
Go!

415
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,395
[screeching]

416
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,687


417
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,172
You have no   

418
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,674
   power here   

419
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,761
   Servant of Morgoth.

420
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:18,221
You   

421
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:21,767
   are nameless,

422
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,145
faceless,

423
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:29,232
formless.

424
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:35,906
Go back to the void   

425
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:39,034
   from whence you came!

426
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,083
[grunting]

427
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,420
[gasps]

428
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,714
[thunder rumbling]

429
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,805


430
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:04,142
The spirit of Sauron endured.

431
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,145
And has been banished.

432
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:09,648
He will flee into the East.

433
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,609
Gondor   

434
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,860
   should be warned

435
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,488
and set a watch on the walls of Mordor.

436
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,281
No,

437
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,733
look after the Lady Galadriel.

438
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:22,244
She has spent much of her power.

439
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,329
Her strength is failing.

440
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,914
Take her to Lothlórien.

441
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,541
My Lord Saruman,

442
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,459
he must be hunted down   

443
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,711
   and destroyed once and for all.

444
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,797
Without the Ring of Power   

445
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:37,634
   Sauron can never again
hold dominion over Middle-earth.

446
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,054
Go now,

447
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,808
leave Sauron to me.

448
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,984
I need a horse.
What?

449
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:58,321
Gandalf, where are you going?
To warn Erebor,

450
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:01,783
they have no idea what is coming.
I saw it   

451
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:05,328
   with my own eyes,
rank upon rank of Moria Orcs.

452
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:08,415
You must summon our friends,
bird and beast;

453
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:11,751
the battle for the Mountain
is about to begin.

454
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,044
Wait.

455
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,424
Take this.

456
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:24,181
If what you say is true,
then you'll need it more than I.

457
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,393
Thank you.

458
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,147
A word of warning, eh?

459
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:33,678
It can be a bit sticky sometimes.

460
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,902
You just have to twiddle with the top.

461
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,113
I expect you'll manage.

462
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,622
It is here in these halls,

463
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:49,915
I know it.

464
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,958
We have searched and searched.

465
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,210
Not well enough.

466
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,754
Thorin, we all would see the stone returned.

467
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:58,924
And yet, it is still not found!

468
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:05,680
Do you doubt the loyalty of anyone here?

469
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,233
The Arkenstone   

470
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,277
   is the birthright of our people.

471
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,948
It is The King's Jewel.

472
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,825
Am I not the King?

473
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,672
Know this!

474
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:44,386
If anyone should find it   

475
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,222
   and withhold it from me,   

476
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,934
   I will be avenged.

477
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,279
[sighing]

478
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,076
Dragon-sickness!

479
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,246
I've seen it before.

480
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:14,499
That look,

481
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,710
the terrible need,

482
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:21,172
it is a fierce and jealous love, Bilbo.

483
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:25,885
It sent his grandfather mad.

484
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,514
Balin, if- if Thorin   

485
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,350
   had the Arkenstone,   

486
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:34,352
   if- if   

487
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:35,603
   it was found,   

488
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,649
   would it help?

489
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:45,989
That stone crowns all.

490
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,035
It is the summit of this great wealth,   

491
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,328
   bestowing power   

492
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,538
   upon he who uses it.

493
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,707
Would it stay his madness?

494
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:58,668
No, laddie.

495
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,547
I fear it would make it worse.

496
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:07,093
Imagine it's best   

497
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,888
   if it remains lost.

498
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:24,986
What is that?

499
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,989
In your hand.

500
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,240
It- It's nothing.

501
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:30,784
Show me.

502
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:33,745
It's   

503
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,254
I picked it up in Beorn's garden.

504
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:49,094
You've carried it all this way?

505
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,137
I want to plant it in my garden,

506
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,972
in Bag-End.

507
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,770
A poor prize to take back to the Shire.

508
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:01,940
One day it will grow

509
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:06,027
and every time I look at it, I'll remember.

510
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,073
Remember everything that happened,
the good, the bad   

511
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:13,284
   and how lucky I am that I made it home.

512
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,129
Thorin, I   

513
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,630
Thorin,

514
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:27,966
survivors from Laketown,

515
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,385
   they're streaming into Dale.

516
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,513
There's hundreds of them.

517
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:37,142
Call everyone to the gate.

518
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:39,519
To the gate!

519
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:40,812
Now!

520
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,565
[chattering]

521
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,094
Come on!

522
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:14,429
Keep moving!
Sire!

523
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,557
Sire!

524
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,225
Up here!

525
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:30,236
Look, sire! The braziers are lit.

526
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,696
So,   

527
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:35,658
   the Company of Thorin Oakenshield
survived!

528
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,118
Survived?

529
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,246
You mean there's a bunch of Dwarves
in there with all that gold?

530
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,416
You shouldn't worry, Alfrid.

531
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,710
There's gold enough in that Mountain for all.

532
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,046
Make camp here tonight!

533
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:50,006
Find what shelter you can!

534
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:51,883
Get some fires going!

535
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:54,302
Come on, hurry along now.
Alfrid!

536
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:55,762
Take   

537
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:56,846
   the night watch!

538
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:06,731
Up it goes!

539
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:11,736
That's it.

540
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,534
I want this Fortress made safe by sun-up.

541
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,953
This Mountain was hard-won,

542
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,121
I will not see it taken again.

543
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,499
The people of Laketown have nothing.

544
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,125
They came to us in need.

545
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,836
They have lost everything.

546
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:32,215
Do not tell me what they have lost.

547
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:35,510
I know well enough their hardship.

548
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,138
Those who've lived through dragon fire   

549
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,598
   should rejoice!

550
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:42,934
They have much   

551
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,352
   to be grateful for.

552
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:50,817
More stones.

553
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,822
More stones at the gate!

554
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,115
That's it.

555
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,214
[baby crying]

556
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:20,054
These children are starving.
We need food.

557
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,473
We won't last three days.
Bard   

558
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:25,226
   we don't have enough.
Do what you can, Percy.

559
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,521
It will be all right, don't worry.

560
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,732
We need more water.

561
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:33,318
The children and the wounded
and the women come first.

562
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:34,736
Here you are.

563
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:36,736
Good morning, Alfrid.

564
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:39,157
What news from the night watch?

565
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:41,951
All quiet, Sire. Not much to report.

566
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:44,370
Nothing gets past me.

567
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,547
Except an army of Elves, it would seem.

568
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,423
My Lord Thranduil, we did not look   

569
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:40,051
   to see you here.
I heard you needed aid.

570
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,936
[chattering, murmuring]

571
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,113
Here you go.

572
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,573
Pass it back.

573
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:04,575
Another one.

574
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:09,622
You have saved us.

575
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,833
I do not know how to thank you!

576
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:13,918
Your gratitude is misplaced!

577
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:16,713
I did not come on your behalf.

578
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:19,841
I came to reclaim something of mine.

579
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:30,518
<i>There are gems in the Mountain
that I, too, desire.</i>

580
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:34,397
<i>White gems of pure starlight.</i>

581
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,525
The White Gems of Lasgalen.

582
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:42,405
I know an Elf Lord who would pay
a pretty price for these.

583
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:49,996
Wait! Please wait!

584
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:55,877
You would go to war over a 
handful of gems?

585
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:59,714
The heirlooms of my people are not 
lightly forsaken.

586
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:01,466
We are allies in this.

587
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:03,718
My people   

588
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:06,679
   also have a claim upon the 
riches in that Mountain.

589
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:07,972
Let me   

590
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:09,474
   speak with Thorin.

591
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:12,477
You would try to reason with the Dwarf?

592
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,061
To avoid war,

593
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:15,938
yes.

594
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:18,733
Not a bad night's work.

595
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:22,069
Come on!

596
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,345
Hail Thorin, son of Thrain.

597
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:50,097
We are glad to find you alive beyond hope.

598
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:51,808
Why do you come to the gate   

599
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,519
   of the King under the Mountain
armed for war?

600
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:57,647
Why does the King under the Mountain
fence himself in,   

601
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:00,691
   like a robber in his home?

602
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,445
Perhaps it is because I am 
expecting to be robbed.

603
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,531
My lord,   

604
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:09,367
   we have not come to rob you,   

605
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:11,869
   but to seek fair settlement.

606
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,413
Will you not speak with me?

607
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:34,225
[cawing]

608
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:50,783
I'm listening.

609
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,703
On behalf of the people of Laketown,   

610
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,997
   I ask that you honor your pledge.

611
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:57,915
A share of the treasure   

612
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:00,167
   so that they might rebuild their lives.

613
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:03,379
I don't treat with any man   

614
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:06,382
   while an armed host lies before my door.

615
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:10,303
That armed host will attack this Mountain
if we do not come to terms.

616
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:14,348
Your threats don't sway me.

617
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:17,643
What of your conscience?

618
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:21,063
Does it not tell you our cause is just?

619
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:24,984
My people offered you help

620
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:30,573
and in return, you brought upon them
only ruin and death.

621
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:34,035
Why did the men of Laketown come to our aid
but for the promise of rich reward?

622
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:35,578
A bargain was struck!

623
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:37,038
A bargain?

624
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:40,166
What choice did we have but to 
barter our birthright   

625
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,209
   for blankets and food?
To ransom   

626
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,670
   our future in exchange
for our freedom?

627
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:47,715
You call that a fair trade?

628
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:51,177
Tell me,   

629
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,054
   Bard the Dragon-Slayer,   

630
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:57,308
   why should I honor such terms?

631
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:01,437
Because you gave us your word.

632
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:07,860
Does that mean nothing?

633
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:23,584
Begone,

634
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:25,461
ere our arrows   

635
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:26,712
   fly!

636
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:28,589
[grunts]

637
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:46,023
What are you doing?

638
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:50,236
You cannot go to war.

639
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,698
This does not concern you.
Excuse me,   

640
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:57,410
   but just in case you haven't noticed
there is an army of Elves out there!

641
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:00,454
Not to mention several hundred
angry fishermen.

642
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:02,790
W-w- we are in fact, outnumbered.

643
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,669
Not for much longer.

644
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:09,463
What does that mean?

645
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:11,465
It means, Master Baggins,   

646
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:16,846
   you should never underestimate Dwarves.

647
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,351
We have reclaimed Erebor.

648
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:24,854
Now   

649
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:26,689
   we defend it.

650
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,375
He will give us nothing.

651
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:49,003
Such a pity.

652
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:49,879
Still,   

653
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,631
   you tried.
I do not understand.

654
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:54,925
Why?

655
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:57,178
Why would he risk war?

656
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:58,804
[grunting]

657
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,902
It is fruitless to reason with them.

658
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:14,153
They understand   

659
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:15,738
   only one thing.

660
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:20,910
We attack at dawn.

661
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:25,623
Are you with us?

662
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:58,405
Aye.

663
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:04,703
Master Baggins!    Come here.

664
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,639
You're going to need this.

665
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,392
Put it on.

666
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:34,150
This vest is made of silver steel.

667
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:38,028
Mithril   

668
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,447
   it was cored by my forebears.

669
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:45,661
No blade can pierce it.

670
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:57,965
I look absurd.

671
00:52:58,216 --> 00:53:00,217
I'm not a warrior, I'm a Hobbit.

672
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:01,927
It's a gift.

673
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:05,014
A token of our friendship.

674
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:10,769
True friends are hard to come by.

675
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,106
I have been blind   

676
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:16,233
   but now I'm beginning to see.

677
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:19,111
I am betrayed.

678
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:21,822
Betrayed?

679
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:24,200
The Arkenstone.

680
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:35,169
One of them has taken it.

681
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:45,304
One of them is false.

682
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:47,514
Thorin   

683
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:51,518
   the quest is fulfilled!
You've won the Mountain.

684
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:52,978
Is that not enough?

685
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,731
Betrayed by my own kin.
No, uh   

686
00:53:56,399 --> 00:54:00,069
   you- you made a promise to the 
people of Laketown.

687
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,570
Is this treasure   

688
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:04,323
   truly worth more than your honor?

689
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:06,992
Our honor, Thorin. I was also there,
I gave my word.

690
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:09,495
For that, I am grateful.

691
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:11,580
That was nobly done, but the treasure   

692
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:13,499
   does not belong to the people   

693
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,000
   of Laketown.

694
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:16,252
This gold   

695
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:21,840
   is ours   

696
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:26,262
   ours alone.

697
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,350
With my life   

698
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:35,187
   I will not part   

699
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:39,233
   with a single coin.

700
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:42,528
Not   

701
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,030
   one   

702
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:47,616
   piece of it.

703
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:09,888
Gundabad!

704
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:14,852
What lies beyond?

705
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:16,854
An old enemy.

706
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:18,188
The ancient Kingdom   

707
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,648
   of Angmar.

708
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:25,154
This fortress was once its stronghold.

709
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,698
It is where they kept their great armouries,

710
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:30,451
forged their weapons of war.

711
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,495
A light, I saw movement.

712
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:38,584
We wait for the cover of night.

713
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:41,754
It is a fell place, Tauriel.

714
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:44,590
In another age, our people waged war   

715
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,008
   on those lands.

716
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:57,811
My mother died there.

717
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:01,732
My father does not speak of it.

718
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:05,110
There is no grave,

719
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:08,155
no memory,

720
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:11,909
nothing.

721
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:21,418
(forging sounds)
Unh!
Let me through!

722
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,129
Make way!

723
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:28,384
[man shouting indistinctly]

724
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:29,635
[men grunt]

725
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,396
No! No!

726
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:42,940
No! Oi! You!

727
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:44,608
Pointy hat!

728
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:46,819
Yes!

729
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:50,072
You! We don't want no tramps, beggars   

730
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:51,615
   nor vagabonds around here!

731
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:53,951
We've got enough trouble without 
the likes of you.

732
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:57,996
Off you go. On your horse.

733
00:56:58,248 --> 00:56:59,915
Who's in charge here?

734
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:01,208
Who's asking?

735
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:08,715
You must set aside your petty 
grievances with the Dwarves.

736
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:10,008
War is coming!

737
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,385
The cesspits   

738
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:13,011
   of Dol Guldur have been   

739
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,263
   emptied.

740
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:15,013
You are all   

741
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:16,348
   in mortal danger.

742
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:17,891
What are you talking about?

743
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:20,227
I can see you know nothing   

744
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:21,728
   of Wizards.

745
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:24,231
They are like winter thunder
on a wild wind,   

746
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:27,985
   rolling in from a distance
breaking hard and alarmed;

747
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:31,780
but sometimes a storm   

748
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:33,657
   is just a storm.

749
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:35,409
Not this time.

750
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:38,120
Armies of Orcs are on the move.

751
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:40,706
These are fighters that have been bred for war.

752
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:43,584
Our enemy has summoned his full strength.

753
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:45,377
Why show his hand now?

754
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:46,879
Because we forced him.

755
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:50,299
We forced him when the Company of Thorin
set out to reclaim   

756
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:51,925
   their homeland.

757
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:54,344
The Dwarves were never meant
to reach Erebor.

758
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:57,347
Azog the Defiler was sent to kill them.

759
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:01,101
His master seeks control of the Mountain,

760
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:03,437
not just for the treasure within,   

761
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:07,274
   but for where it lies,
its strategic position.

762
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:09,193
This is the gateway   

763
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:12,613
   to reclaiming
the lands of Angmar in the north.

764
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:16,033
If that fell Kingdom should rise again   

765
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:20,162
   Rivendell, Lórien, the Shire,   

766
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:22,206
   even Gondor itself will fall.

767
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:26,043
These Orc armies you speak of,
Mithrandir,   

768
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,462
   where are they?

769
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:34,593


770
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:41,183


771
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:54,154
[rumbling]

772
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:56,406
[were-worms roaring]

773
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:04,748


774
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:07,751
[screeching]

775
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:24,351
These bats are bred for one purpose.

776
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:25,852
For what?

777
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:29,314
For war.

778
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,124
[shouting]

779
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:51,545
[horns blowing]

780
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,482


781
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:15,235


782
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:18,030
[shouting]

783
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:22,576
[all grunting and yelling]

784
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:29,083
Come on, let's get those blades sharpened.

785
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:31,418
Aye. Blasted Elves.

786
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:33,629
You swing an ax at it?
No, brother.

787
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:53,148
You should be inside.

788
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:56,860
Out of the wind.

789
01:00:57,111 --> 01:00:58,654
No, I   

790
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:03,116
   needed some air.
Place still stinks of dragon.

791
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:10,826
The Elves have been moving   

792
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:13,085
   their archers into position.
Ah.

793
01:01:15,421 --> 01:01:16,630
The battle will be over   

794
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:18,048
   by tomorrow's eve.

795
01:01:18,883 --> 01:01:21,009
Though I doubt we will live
to see it.

796
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:27,057
No, these are dark days.

797
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:30,477
Dark days indeed.

798
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:33,730
Hmm.

799
01:01:35,149 --> 01:01:38,193
No one could blame a soul
for wishing themselves elsewhere.

800
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:46,243
Must be nearing midnight.

801
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:48,078
Bombur's got the next watch.

802
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:50,872
It'll take a bit to wake him.

803
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:54,418
Bofur?

804
01:01:57,463 --> 01:01:59,589
I will see you in the morning.

805
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:03,427
Goodbye, Bilbo.

806
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:27,743
[grunts]

807
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:50,766
Since when did my counsel
counted for so little?

808
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:52,684
What do you think I'm trying to do?

809
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:55,479
I think you're trying to save your 
Dwarvish friends, and I admire   

810
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,939
   your loyalty to them.

811
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:00,942
But it does not dissuade me
from my course.

812
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:04,112
You started this, Mithrandir.

813
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:07,657
You will forgive me if I finish it.

814
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:09,618
Are the archers in position?

815
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:12,704
Yes, My Lord.
Give the order:

816
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:15,582
If anything moves on that Mountain   

817
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:16,917
   kill it!

818
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:22,172
The Dwarves are out of time.

819
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:23,423
  Bowman!

820
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:25,675
Did you agree with this?

821
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:28,220
Is gold so important to you?

822
01:03:29,013 --> 01:03:31,515
Would you buy it with 
the blood of Dwarves?

823
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:33,308
It will not come to that.

824
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:36,311
This is a fight they cannot win.
That won't stop them!

825
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:39,481
You think the Dwarves will surrender?
They won't!

826
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:41,525
They will fight to the death to
defend their own.

827
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:43,235
Bilbo Baggins!

828
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:45,058
If I'm not mistaken   

829
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:47,697
   this is the Halfling
who stole the keys   

830
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:49,574
   to my dungeons from under   

831
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,660
   the nose of my guards.

832
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:55,247
He is.

833
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:56,998
Sorry   

834
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,416
   about that.

835
01:03:58,960 --> 01:03:59,960
I came   

836
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:02,712
   to give you   

837
01:04:02,964 --> 01:04:03,964
   this.

838
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:10,595
The Heart of the Mountain.

839
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:13,849
The King's Jewel.

840
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:17,310
And worth a King's ransom.

841
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:19,980
How is this   

842
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:21,356
   yours to give?

843
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:23,608
I took it as my 14th share
of the treasure.

844
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:26,361
Why would you do this?

845
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:27,863
You owe us no loyalty.

846
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:29,823
I'm not doing it for you.

847
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:33,910
I know that Dwarves can be obstinate   

848
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:35,704
   and pigheaded   

849
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:37,539
   and difficult,

850
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:39,583
   suspicious and secretive   

851
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:41,376
   with the worst manners   

852
01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:43,670
   you can possibly imagine,
but they are also brave   

853
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:45,171
   and kind   

854
01:04:46,757 --> 01:04:48,091
   and loyal to a fault.

855
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,260
I've grown   

856
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:53,054
   very fond of them,
and I would save them if I can

857
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:54,931
but Thorin   

858
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:57,434
   values this Stone above all else.

859
01:04:57,685 --> 01:05:00,061
In exchange for its return,
I believe he will give you   

860
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:01,396
   what you are owed.

861
01:05:01,647 --> 01:05:02,647
There will be no need   

862
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:03,857
   for war.

863
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,280
Rest up tonight.

864
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:13,199
You must leave on the morrow.
What?

865
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:16,369
Get as far away from here as possible.
I- I'm not leaving.
Oh?

866
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:19,372
You picked me as the 14th man.
I'm not about to leave the Company now.

867
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:21,625
There is no Company, not anymore  

868
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:24,356
and I don't like to think what Thorin will do
when he finds out what you've done.

869
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:26,171
I'm not afraid of Thorin.

870
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:27,714
Well, you should be!

871
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:29,299
Don't underestimate   

872
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:31,468
   the evil of gold.

873
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:32,719
Gold over which   

874
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:35,055
   a serpent has long brooded.

875
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:37,849
Dragon-sickness seeps
into the hearts of all   

876
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:39,768
   who come near this Mountain;

877
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:42,395
almost all. Heh!

878
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:46,566
You there,

879
01:05:46,817 --> 01:05:47,901
find this Hobbit a bed   

880
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:50,820
   and fill his belly with hot food.

881
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:53,990
He's earned it.

882
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:57,285
Hey,

883
01:05:58,079 --> 01:05:59,079
keep an eye on him.

884
01:05:59,872 --> 01:06:00,872
If he should try   

885
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:02,958
   to leave, you tell me.

886
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:06,795
Move it,

887
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:08,505
stupid Hobbit.

888
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:45,208
Wakey, wakey, Hobbit, up you     get?

889
01:07:07,648 --> 01:07:09,357
I will put the next one between your eyes.

890
01:07:09,608 --> 01:07:11,651
[all shouting]

891
01:07:34,341 --> 01:07:35,633
We have come to tell you   

892
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:39,137
   payment of your debt has been offered   

893
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:40,847
   and accepted.

894
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:43,308
What payment?

895
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:45,769
I gave you nothing.

896
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:48,271
You have nothing.

897
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:56,654
We have this.

898
01:08:00,534 --> 01:08:01,951
They have the Arkenstone.

899
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:04,704
Thieves!

900
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:08,458
How came you by the heirloom
of our House?

901
01:08:08,709 --> 01:08:10,210
That Stone belongs to the King!

902
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:13,046
And the King may have it   

903
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:15,423
   with our goodwill  

904
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:24,307
but first, he must honor his word!

905
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:28,478
They're taking us for fools!

906
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:31,564
This is a ruse!

907
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:34,901
A filthy lie!

908
01:08:36,237 --> 01:08:39,155
The Arkenstone is in this Mountain!

909
01:08:39,406 --> 01:08:40,532
It is a trick!

910
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:42,408
It- It's no trick.

911
01:08:43,577 --> 01:08:44,869
The Stone is real.

912
01:08:46,413 --> 01:08:47,997
I gave it to them.

913
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:57,215
You!?

914
01:08:59,593 --> 01:09:01,803
I took it as my 14th share.

915
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:05,515
You would steal from me?

916
01:09:05,766 --> 01:09:06,933
Steal from you? No,

917
01:09:07,184 --> 01:09:10,395
no. I may be a burglar,
but I like to think I'm an honest one.

918
01:09:13,607 --> 01:09:15,525
I'm willing to let it stand against my claim.

919
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:17,819
Against your claim?

920
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:21,239
Your claim!

921
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:25,076
You have no claim over me,
you miserable rat!

922
01:09:27,621 --> 01:09:29,497
I was going to give it to you.

923
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:33,459
Many times I wanted to, but   
But what,

924
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:35,003
   thief?

925
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:37,505
You are changed, Thorin!

926
01:09:37,756 --> 01:09:38,756
The Dwarf I met   

927
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:41,885
...in Bag End would never have
gone back on his word,

928
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:43,386
would never have doubted   

929
01:09:43,637 --> 01:09:45,180
   the loyalty of his kin!

930
01:09:45,931 --> 01:09:48,183
Do not speak to me   

931
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:50,226
   of loyalty.

932
01:09:53,814 --> 01:09:55,064
Throw him from the rampart!

933
01:10:04,325 --> 01:10:05,366
Did you not hear me?!
     No! (shouting, yelling)

934
01:10:08,954 --> 01:10:10,747
I will do it myself. I curse you!

935
01:10:11,999 --> 01:10:12,582
No!

936
01:10:12,833 --> 01:10:14,083
Cursed be the Wizard   

937
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:17,170
   that forced you on this Company!
If you don't like my burglar   

938
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:18,421
   then please,   

939
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:19,547
   don't damage him!

940
01:10:19,673 --> 01:10:20,924
Return him to me!

941
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:29,766
You're not making a very splendid figure
as King under the Mountain   

942
01:10:30,017 --> 01:10:33,853
   are you, Thorin,   

943
01:10:34,104 --> 01:10:35,271
   son of Thrain?

944
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:44,405
Never again will I have dealings
with Wizards!

945
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:45,240
Go!!

946
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:46,491
Shire rat!

947
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:53,039
Are we resolved?

948
01:10:53,999 --> 01:10:54,999
The return   

949
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:57,210
   of the Arkenstone
for what was promised!

950
01:11:06,971 --> 01:11:07,595
Why should I   

951
01:11:07,846 --> 01:11:09,639
   buy back that which is   

952
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:10,890
   rightfully mine?

953
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:14,769
Keep the Stone   

954
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:16,271
   sell it.

955
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:19,315
Ecthelion of Gondor
will give you a good price for it.

956
01:11:19,566 --> 01:11:20,566
I will kill you!

957
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:22,902
By my oath,
I will kill you all!

958
01:11:23,153 --> 01:11:24,737
Your oath means nothing.

959
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:28,700
I've heard enough.

960
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:38,710
Thorin   

961
01:11:38,877 --> 01:11:39,919
   lay down your arms!

962
01:11:41,255 --> 01:11:43,047
Open these doors!

963
01:11:43,549 --> 01:11:44,674
This treasure   

964
01:11:44,925 --> 01:11:46,759
   will be your death.

965
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:48,803
Thorin, we cannot   

966
01:11:49,054 --> 01:11:50,972
   win this fight.

967
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:02,567
Give us your answer!

968
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:05,403
Will you have Peace   

969
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:08,489
   or War?

970
01:12:10,909 --> 01:12:12,410
[cawing]

971
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:21,961
I will have War.

972
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,049
[rumbling - army marching]

973
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:36,559
Ironfoot!!  (army marching)

974
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:41,064
[shouting]

975
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:49,197
Dain!! Dain!! [all shouting]

976
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:50,448
[shouting)

977
01:12:56,705 --> 01:12:59,040
Hey, Thorin!

978
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:00,875
Ironfoot has come!

979
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:09,175
Who is that?

980
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:10,968
He doesn't look very happy.

981
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,971
It is Dain, Lord of the Iron Hills,

982
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:15,223
Thorin's   

983
01:13:15,307 --> 01:13:16,933
   cousin.
Are they alike?

984
01:13:18,018 --> 01:13:21,646
I've always found Thorin
the more reasonable of the two.

985
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:33,032
Good morning!

986
01:13:33,283 --> 01:13:34,826
How are we all?

987
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:39,789
I have a wee proposition   

988
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:42,333
   if you wouldn't mind giving me
a few moments   

989
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:43,835
   of your time.

990
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:47,130
Would ya consider   

991
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:50,383
   JUST SODDING OFF?

992
01:13:51,718 --> 01:13:52,718
All of you!

993
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:54,429
Right now!

994
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:55,680
Stand fast!!

995
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:58,683
Calm now, Lord Dain!

996
01:13:59,643 --> 01:14:01,227
Gandalf the Grey!!

997
01:14:03,147 --> 01:14:04,272
Tell this rabble   

998
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:06,357
   to leave, or I'll water   

999
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:08,276
   the ground with their blood!

1000
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:12,905
There is no need for war   

1001
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:15,825
   between Dwarves, Men and Elves.

1002
01:14:16,076 --> 01:14:17,076
A legion of Orcs   

1003
01:14:17,327 --> 01:14:18,870
   march on the Mountain.

1004
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:19,829
Stand your army down.

1005
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:23,124
I will not stand down before any Elf.

1006
01:14:23,834 --> 01:14:26,836
Not least this faithless Woodland Sprite.

1007
01:14:27,838 --> 01:14:30,882
He wishes nothing but ill upon my people.

1008
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:32,967
If he chooses   

1009
01:14:33,218 --> 01:14:35,887
   to stand between me and my kin,   

1010
01:14:37,181 --> 01:14:39,056
   I'll split his pretty head open!

1011
01:14:41,393 --> 01:14:43,227
See if he's still smirking then!

1012
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:46,105
Dain!! (shouting)   

1013
01:14:46,356 --> 01:14:47,356
   wait!

1014
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:50,735
[all shouting]

1015
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:53,738
Let them advance.

1016
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:55,740
See how far they get.

1017
01:14:55,991 --> 01:14:58,242
You think I give a dead dog
for your threats   

1018
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:00,203
   you pointy-eared   

1019
01:15:00,454 --> 01:15:01,871
   princess?

1020
01:15:02,207 --> 01:15:04,333
Hear that, lads? We're on!

1021
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:08,252
Let's give these bastards a good hammering!

1022
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:10,004
Come on, Sons of Durin! [shouting it in Dwarvish]

1023
01:15:10,881 --> 01:15:12,673
[all shouting]

1024
01:15:13,008 --> 01:15:14,175
Stand your men down.

1025
01:15:14,426 --> 01:15:16,802
I'll deal with Ironfoot and his rabble.

1026
01:15:22,976 --> 01:15:23,601
Right then.

1027
01:15:23,852 --> 01:15:25,686
Let's get this done.

1028
01:15:26,647 --> 01:15:28,272
Send in the goats.

1029
01:15:28,607 --> 01:15:30,441
[shouting in Dwarvish]

1030
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:41,827
[shouting in Elvish]

1031
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:45,498
Thranduil!

1032
01:15:45,582 --> 01:15:46,958
This is madness!

1033
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:48,668
[all shouting]

1034
01:15:51,421 --> 01:15:52,421

[all shouting]

1037
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:12,525
Hey, how do you like that, the ol' twirley-whirlies?

1038
01:16:12,776 --> 01:16:14,151
Ha, ha, you buggers!

1039
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:15,403
[shouting in Elvish]

1040
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:00,615
[chattering]

1041
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:09,874
[rumbling, growling]

1042
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:22,386
Were-worms!

1043
01:17:23,722 --> 01:17:25,431
[roaring]

1044
01:17:30,896 --> 01:17:33,147
Oh, come on!

1045
01:17:45,786 --> 01:17:47,536


1046
01:17:49,873 --> 01:17:52,124
[Orc horn blowing]

1047
01:18:00,258 --> 01:18:01,842
[shouting in Dwarvish]

1048
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:05,054
The Hordes of Hell are upon us!

1049
01:18:05,305 --> 01:18:07,181
Fight to the death!

1050
01:18:12,979 --> 01:18:15,147
[all grunting and snarling]

1051
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,486
I'm going over the wall.
Who's coming with me?

1052
01:18:20,737 --> 01:18:22,697
Aye! Yes!
Come on, let's go!

1053
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:24,615
Stand down!!
What?

1054
01:18:24,866 --> 01:18:26,367
Are we to do nothing?

1055
01:18:26,618 --> 01:18:28,285
I said, <i>stand down!</i>

1056
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:34,250
The Elves!

1057
01:18:34,501 --> 01:18:36,127
Will they not fight?

1058
01:18:57,274 --> 01:18:58,274
[shouting in Dwarvish]

1059
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:29,930
Attack!!  Attack!

1061
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,309
[speaking in Dwarvish]

1062
01:19:35,395 --> 01:19:36,479
Uh, Gandalf,

1063
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:38,355
is this a good place to stand?

1064
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:40,191


1065
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:43,444

[all shouting in cadence]

1071
01:21:01,898 --> 01:21:03,274
Azog.

1072
01:21:04,776 --> 01:21:06,902
He's trying to cut us off.

1073
01:21:11,157 --> 01:21:12,157
All of you,

1074
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:14,326
fall back to Dale!

1075
01:21:14,578 --> 01:21:15,703
Now!

1076
01:21:18,623 --> 01:21:19,748
To the city!

1077
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,042
Bilbo! This way!

1078
01:21:24,921 --> 01:21:26,380

Tilda !

1085
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:48,128
My children, where are my children?

1086
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:51,298
I saw them, they were down in the old market!

1087
01:22:51,549 --> 01:22:52,758
The market?

1088
01:22:53,259 --> 01:22:54,677
Where are they now?

1089
01:22:54,928 --> 01:22:56,512
Tilda! Sigrid!

1090
01:22:56,763 --> 01:22:59,431
Bard! Orcs are storming over the Causeway!

1091
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:03,686
Get the bowmen to the eastern parapet.
Hold them off as long as you can.

1092
01:23:03,937 --> 01:23:05,938
Archers, this way!

1093
01:23:06,189 --> 01:23:08,399
The Orcs have taken Stone Street,

1094
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:10,359
the market's overrun!

1095
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:15,197
The rest of you   

1096
01:23:15,448 --> 01:23:16,782
   follow me!

1097
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:26,583
[all shouting]

1098

You must not come out for any reason.

01:40:32,359 --> 01:40:35,987
And how do you plan to fight your way
single-handed to Ravenhill?

1289
01:40:36,947 --> 01:40:37,947
Halt!

1290
01:40:44,163 --> 01:40:45,723
It's been a while since I've done this.

1291
01:40:45,914 --> 01:40:46,914
[shouting]

1292
01:40:47,916 --> 01:40:49,292
To Ravenhill!

1293
01:40:49,543 --> 01:40:50,668
Hold tight, lads.

1294
01:40:51,879 --> 01:40:53,421
You're all mad bastards.

1295
01:40:54,339 --> 01:40:55,840
I like it.

1296
01:40:57,634 --> 01:41:00,386
May Durin save you all.

1297
01:41:22,576 --> 01:41:23,576
[laughs]

1298
01:41:28,582 --> 01:41:29,874
[shouting]

1299
01:41:30,125 --> 01:41:31,667
[horn blowing]

1300
01:41:41,762 --> 01:41:42,762
Watch out!

1301
01:41:50,979 --> 01:41:51,979
Eyes front   

1302
01:41:52,022 --> 01:41:53,022
   lads!

1303
01:42:01,657 --> 01:42:03,491
Hold on!

1304
01:42:09,957 --> 01:42:11,415
I'm out!

1305
01:42:17,422 --> 01:42:19,006
[roars]

1306
01:42:20,425 --> 01:42:22,051
Bring it down!

1307
01:42:22,302 --> 01:42:24,637
Shoot it!
Where?

1308
01:42:24,888 --> 01:42:26,222
In his jambags!

1309
01:42:26,473 --> 01:42:28,182
It doesn't have any jambags!

1310
01:42:28,433 --> 01:42:29,642
Duck
Kili!

1311
01:42:31,895 --> 01:42:33,020
Move it!

1312
01:42:34,857 --> 01:42:36,941
Hang on, lads! I'm coming!

1313
01:42:38,569 --> 01:42:40,444
[laughs then gasps]

1314
01:42:49,288 --> 01:42:50,288
Bofur, you beauty!

1315
01:42:58,463 --> 01:43:00,131
Dwalin!
Go!

1316
01:43:04,303 --> 01:43:05,303
Come on   

1317
01:43:05,554 --> 01:43:07,096
   you hairy hedgepig!

1318
01:43:07,347 --> 01:43:08,347
Come on!

1319
01:43:12,644 --> 01:43:13,644
Yeah!

1320
01:43:13,896 --> 01:43:15,479
Yeah!
Yeah!

1321
01:43:17,316 --> 01:43:18,316
Wargs!

1322
01:43:33,707 --> 01:43:35,082
Hold tight, lads.

1323
01:43:50,682 --> 01:43:51,682
There's more coming!

1324
01:43:54,186 --> 01:43:55,895
[snarling]

1325
01:43:56,146 --> 01:43:57,688
We're pulling too much weight.

1326
01:43:57,940 --> 01:43:59,273
We won't make it.

1327
01:43:59,524 --> 01:44:00,524
Cut the tracers.

1328
01:44:02,361 --> 01:44:03,945
Ride them to Ravenhill.

1329
01:44:04,947 --> 01:44:05,947
No, Balin.

1330
01:44:07,574 --> 01:44:09,951
My goat-riding days are over.

1331
01:44:12,079 --> 01:44:13,663
Durin be with you, brother.

1332
01:44:42,401 --> 01:44:45,194
I am too old for this.

1333
01:44:46,613 --> 01:44:47,613
Hyah!

1334
01:44:48,573 --> 01:44:49,615
Onwards!

1335
01:44:49,866 --> 01:44:51,492
Lead on!

1336
01:45:11,138 --> 01:45:12,138
[roars]

1337
01:45:15,851 --> 01:45:16,851
[screams]

1338
01:45:22,149 --> 01:45:23,316
Get up.

1339
01:45:23,900 --> 01:45:25,109
Get away from me.

1340
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:26,652
I don't take orders   

1341
01:45:26,903 --> 01:45:28,362
   from you.
People trusted you.

1342
01:45:28,613 --> 01:45:29,780
They listened to you.

1343
01:45:30,032 --> 01:45:31,032
The Master's mantle   

1344
01:45:31,283 --> 01:45:33,367
   was there for the taking   

1345
01:45:34,453 --> 01:45:35,786
   and you threw it all away.

1346
01:45:36,663 --> 01:45:38,080
For what?

1347
01:45:46,757 --> 01:45:47,840
Alfrid   

1348
01:45:48,091 --> 01:45:49,550
   your slip is showing.

1349
01:45:53,972 --> 01:45:55,681
[shouting]

1350
01:46:05,484 --> 01:46:07,318


1351
01:46:08,487 --> 01:46:09,195
[roaring]

1352
01:46:09,446 --> 01:46:10,696
[crackling]

1353
01:46:38,642 --> 01:46:39,642
[screaming]

1354
01:46:59,204 --> 01:47:00,204
[screams]

1355
01:47:03,959 --> 01:47:05,960
[choking]

1356
01:47:15,178 --> 01:47:16,178
[groans]

1357
01:47:19,057 --> 01:47:21,392
We may yet survive this.

1358
01:47:22,769 --> 01:47:23,769
Gandalf!

1359
01:47:31,570 --> 01:47:32,570
It's Thorin  

1360
01:47:33,321 --> 01:47:34,363
and Fili, Kili   

1361
01:47:34,990 --> 01:47:36,365
   and Dwalin.

1362
01:47:37,409 --> 01:47:39,410
He's taking his best warriors.

1363
01:47:39,661 --> 01:47:40,870
To do what?

1364
01:47:41,746 --> 01:47:44,123
To cut the head off the snake.

1365
01:47:44,749 --> 01:47:46,750
[hooves clopping]

1366
01:48:05,270 --> 01:48:06,270
[yells]

1367
01:48:17,908 --> 01:48:18,908
Die!

1368
01:48:25,916 --> 01:48:27,291
Gandalf!

1369
01:48:28,001 --> 01:48:29,210
Legolas.

1370
01:48:30,837 --> 01:48:32,004
Legolas Greenleaf!

1371
01:48:32,255 --> 01:48:33,464
There's a second army.

1372
01:48:33,715 --> 01:48:36,675
Bolg leads a force of Gundabad Orcs.
They are almost upon us.

1373
01:48:36,927 --> 01:48:38,385
Gundabad? Ahh.

1374
01:48:39,596 --> 01:48:41,263
This was their plan all along.

1375
01:48:43,975 --> 01:48:47,436
Azog engages our forces,
then Bolg sweeps in from the north.

1376
01:48:47,687 --> 01:48:49,063
What, th- the north?

1377
01:48:49,314 --> 01:48:50,648
Where is the north   

1378
01:48:50,899 --> 01:48:52,983
   exactly?
Ravenhill.

1379
01:48:54,194 --> 01:48:55,236
Ravenhill?

1380
01:48:55,487 --> 01:48:57,154
Thorin is up there

1381
01:48:57,405 --> 01:48:59,406
and Fili and Kili. They're all up there.

1382
01:49:15,632 --> 01:49:17,007
Where is he?

1383
01:49:22,222 --> 01:49:23,639
It looks empty.

1384
01:49:25,100 --> 01:49:26,809
I think Azog has fled.

1385
01:49:28,061 --> 01:49:29,687
I don't think so.

1386
01:49:32,399 --> 01:49:33,399
Fili,   

1387
01:49:34,609 --> 01:49:35,985
   take your brother,

1388
01:49:36,236 --> 01:49:37,486
scout out the towers.

1389
01:49:38,363 --> 01:49:40,072
Keep low and out of sight.

1390
01:49:40,323 --> 01:49:41,365
If you see something   

1391
01:49:41,616 --> 01:49:42,816
   report back. Do not engage.

1392
01:49:43,034 --> 01:49:45,244
Do you understand?
We have company.

1393
01:49:45,495 --> 01:49:46,495
[grunting]

1394
01:49:46,538 --> 01:49:47,913
Goblin mercenaries.

1395
01:49:48,164 --> 01:49:49,498
No more than a hundred.

1396
01:49:49,749 --> 01:49:51,375
We'll take care of them. Go!

1397
01:49:51,626 --> 01:49:52,793
Go!

1398
01:49:54,379 --> 01:49:55,713
Come on!

1399
01:50:24,075 --> 01:50:25,618
Recall your company.

1400
01:50:26,911 --> 01:50:28,787
[Elvish horn blowing]

1401
01:50:31,750 --> 01:50:33,584
My Lord, disperse this force   

1402
01:50:33,835 --> 01:50:35,628
   to Ravenhill.
The Dwarves are about   

1403
01:50:35,879 --> 01:50:36,879
   to be overrun.

1404
01:50:36,921 --> 01:50:37,921
Thorin must be warned.

1405
01:50:38,006 --> 01:50:40,257
By all means, warn him.

1406
01:50:40,508 --> 01:50:42,843
I have spent enough Elvish blood
in defense   

1407
01:50:43,094 --> 01:50:44,511
   of this accursed land. No more!

1408
01:50:44,763 --> 01:50:46,221
Thranduil?

1409
01:50:47,223 --> 01:50:48,223
I'll go.

1410
01:50:49,100 --> 01:50:50,184
Don't be ridiculous.

1411
01:50:50,435 --> 01:50:51,852
You'll never make it.

1412
01:50:52,103 --> 01:50:53,103
Why not?

1413
01:50:53,647 --> 01:50:56,190
Because they will see you coming
and kill you!

1414
01:50:57,067 --> 01:50:58,400
No, they won't.

1415
01:50:59,944 --> 01:51:00,944
They won't see me.

1416
01:51:02,280 --> 01:51:03,947
It's out of the question.

1417
01:51:04,949 --> 01:51:05,949
I won't allow it.

1418
01:51:06,951 --> 01:51:09,370
I'm not asking you to allow it, Gandalf.

1419
01:51:46,116 --> 01:51:47,825


1420
01:51:48,076 --> 01:51:50,202
You will not turn away.

1421
01:51:50,870 --> 01:51:51,954
Not this time.

1422
01:51:52,622 --> 01:51:54,790
Get out of my way.

1423
01:51:55,041 --> 01:51:56,625
The Dwarves will be slaughtered.

1424
01:51:56,876 --> 01:51:58,919
Yes, they will die,

1425
01:51:59,754 --> 01:52:01,046
today,   

1426
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:02,881
   tomorrow,   

1427
01:52:03,133 --> 01:52:05,634
   one year hence,
a hundred years from now.

1428
01:52:06,344 --> 01:52:07,845
What does it matter?

1429
01:52:08,555 --> 01:52:09,596
They are mortal.

1430
01:52:12,809 --> 01:52:14,643
You think your life is worth more than theirs  

1431
01:52:15,228 --> 01:52:17,438
   while there is no love in it?

1432
01:52:18,106 --> 01:52:21,233
There is no love in you.

1433
01:52:28,158 --> 01:52:29,324
What do you know of love?

1434
01:52:29,576 --> 01:52:30,576
Nothing.

1435
01:52:31,578 --> 01:52:32,818
What you feel for that Dwarf   

1436
01:52:32,954 --> 01:52:34,246
   is not real.

1437
01:52:36,624 --> 01:52:38,125
You think it is love?

1438
01:52:39,002 --> 01:52:41,170
Are you ready to die for it?

1439
01:52:44,466 --> 01:52:45,966


1440
01:52:54,642 --> 01:52:56,101
I will go with you.

1441
01:52:59,773 --> 01:53:01,148
[shouting and grunting]

1442
01:53:08,364 --> 01:53:09,448
[yelling]

1443
01:53:18,792 --> 01:53:20,584
Push!

1444
01:53:32,514 --> 01:53:34,598
[panting]

1445
01:53:34,849 --> 01:53:38,018
By Durin, you've lost your ax.

1446
01:53:38,269 --> 01:53:39,394
[whimpers]

1447
01:53:39,646 --> 01:53:40,896
No, he's not.

1448
01:53:41,481 --> 01:53:42,648
There you go, cousin.

1449
01:53:44,484 --> 01:53:47,194
You know where you can stick that.

1450
01:53:55,328 --> 01:53:56,370
[creature roars]

1451
01:53:57,372 --> 01:53:59,248
Hey. Stay here.

1452
01:53:59,499 --> 01:54:01,124
Search the lower levels.

1453
01:54:02,168 --> 01:54:03,669
I've got this.

1454
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:14,680
Where is that Orc filth?

1455
01:54:16,850 --> 01:54:18,058
Thorin.

1456
01:54:18,643 --> 01:54:19,810
Bilbo.

1457
01:54:20,061 --> 01:54:21,687
You have to leave here. Now.

1458
01:54:21,938 --> 01:54:23,897
Azog has an army attacking
from the north.

1459
01:54:24,148 --> 01:54:25,816
This watchtower will be surrounded.

1460
01:54:26,067 --> 01:54:27,901
With no way out.
We are so close.

1461
01:54:28,152 --> 01:54:30,153
That Orc scum is in there.
I say we push on.

1462
01:54:30,405 --> 01:54:32,948
No. That's what he wants.

1463
01:54:33,199 --> 01:54:34,867
He wants to draw us in.

1464
01:54:36,953 --> 01:54:38,120
This is a trap.

1465
01:54:45,336 --> 01:54:46,545
[sniffs]

1466
01:54:46,796 --> 01:54:48,130
Ah.

1467
01:54:48,464 --> 01:54:50,465
[creature roars]

1468
01:54:51,009 --> 01:54:52,968
[rumbling]

1469
01:54:54,178 --> 01:54:55,888
Find Fili and Kili, call them back.

1470
01:54:56,139 --> 01:54:57,639
Thorin, are you sure about this?

1471
01:54:57,891 --> 01:54:58,974
Do it.

1472
01:55:00,810 --> 01:55:02,519
We'll live to fight another day.

Oh   

1476
01:55:26,252 --> 01:55:28,086


1477
01:55:38,348 --> 01:55:39,348
Go.

1478
01:55:43,561 --> 01:55:44,561
Run!

Kili!

1484
01:56:16,761 --> 01:56:17,844
Thorin.

1485
01:56:20,598 --> 01:56:22,015
Thorin. No.

1486
01:56:46,457 --> 01:56:47,499
[roaring]

1487
01:56:47,750 --> 01:56:49,084

(yelling)

1492
01:57:45,433 --> 01:57:46,433
No.

1493
01:57:50,605 --> 01:57:52,147
[all shouting]

1494
01:58:03,367 --> 01:58:04,367

Kili!

1499
02:00:19,712 --> 02:00:20,712
Kili!

1500
02:00:20,963 --> 02:00:21,963
Tauriel!

1501
02:00:23,382 --> 02:00:24,382

No!

1509
02:01:41,210 --> 02:01:42,210
No!

1510
02:02:37,600 --> 02:02:38,683
[both grunting]

02:03:08,089 --> 02:03:09,672

1531
02:12:15,886 --> 02:12:17,762
The Eagles are coming.

02:13:05,560 --> 02:13:06,560
[coughing and gasping]

1533
02:13:08,063 --> 02:13:09,063
Bilbo.

1534
02:13:09,106 --> 02:13:11,065
Don't move. Don't move. Lie still.

1535
02:13:12,734 --> 02:13:15,277
Oh. Mm. Mm.

1536
02:13:15,654 --> 02:13:16,779
I'm glad you are here.

1537
02:13:17,030 --> 02:13:18,572
Shh, shh.
Unh.

1538
02:13:19,533 --> 02:13:21,325
I wish to part from you in friendship.

1539
02:13:21,576 --> 02:13:22,576
No.

1540
02:13:22,661 --> 02:13:24,036
You are not going anywhere.

1541
02:13:24,788 --> 02:13:26,122
You're going to live.

1542
02:13:26,581 --> 02:13:27,581
I would take back   

1543
02:13:27,833 --> 02:13:29,667
   my words and my deeds at the Gate.

1544
02:13:31,503 --> 02:13:33,921
You did what only a true friend would do.

1545
02:13:35,382 --> 02:13:36,382
Forgive me.

1546
02:13:39,177 --> 02:13:41,262
I was too blind to see.

1547
02:13:43,640 --> 02:13:45,182
I am so sorry   

1548
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:48,436
   that I have led you into such peril.

1549
02:13:49,604 --> 02:13:52,356
No, I'm glad to have shared
in your perils, Thorin.

1550
02:13:52,607 --> 02:13:53,899
Each and every one of them.

1551
02:13:57,320 --> 02:14:00,281
It is far more than any Baggins deserves.

1552
02:14:04,703 --> 02:14:05,703
Farewell   

1553
02:14:06,830 --> 02:14:08,622
   Master Burglar.

1554
02:14:09,958 --> 02:14:12,001
Go back to your books,

1555
02:14:13,170 --> 02:14:15,171
and your armchair.

1556
02:14:16,923 --> 02:14:18,841
Plant your trees.

1557
02:14:19,509 --> 02:14:21,177
Watch them grow.

1558
02:14:22,637 --> 02:14:23,929
[groans]

1559
02:14:26,224 --> 02:14:27,975
If more people   

1560
02:14:29,019 --> 02:14:30,644
   valued home   

1561
02:14:30,896 --> 02:14:32,855
   above gold   

1562
02:14:33,857 --> 02:14:37,443
   this world would be a merrier place.

1563
02:14:39,571 --> 02:14:40,613
[grunts]

1564
02:14:41,239 --> 02:14:43,532
No. No, no, no. No.

1565
02:14:43,784 --> 02:14:46,202
Thorin. Thorin, don't you dare.

1566
02:14:48,497 --> 02:14:49,622
Thorin.

1567
02:14:55,587 --> 02:14:57,963
Thorin. Thorin, hold on.

1568
02:14:58,215 --> 02:14:59,381
Hold on, please.

1569
02:14:59,925 --> 02:15:01,092
The Eagles   

1570
02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:03,969
The Eagles    The Eagles are here.

1571
02:15:04,638 --> 02:15:05,805
Thorin?

1572
02:15:09,017 --> 02:15:10,142
The Ea   

1573
02:15:11,645 --> 02:15:13,646
[sobbing]

1574
02:15:27,327 --> 02:15:29,328
[sniffling]

1575
02:16:06,783 --> 02:16:09,410
I cannot go back.

1576
02:16:10,453 --> 02:16:11,453
Where will you go?

1577
02:16:13,582 --> 02:16:15,082
I do not know.

1578
02:16:16,334 --> 02:16:17,751
Go north.

1579
02:16:18,378 --> 02:16:19,962
Find the Dúnedain.

1580
02:16:21,506 --> 02:16:24,758
There's a young Ranger amongst them.
You should meet him.

1581
02:16:26,928 --> 02:16:29,221
His father, Arathorn, was a good man.

1582
02:16:29,806 --> 02:16:31,182
His son   

1583
02:16:31,850 --> 02:16:34,018
   might grow to be a great one.

1584
02:16:36,855 --> 02:16:37,855
What is his name?

1585
02:16:38,899 --> 02:16:41,275
He's known in the Wild as Strider.

1586
02:16:42,152 --> 02:16:43,777
His true name   

1587
02:16:44,029 --> 02:16:46,447
   you must discover for yourself.

1588
02:16:50,493 --> 02:16:51,744
Legolas!

1589
02:16:53,413 --> 02:16:55,164
Your mother loved you!

1590
02:16:57,500 --> 02:16:59,126
More than anyone!

1591
02:17:00,086 --> 02:17:01,712
More than life!

1592
02:17:37,499 --> 02:17:39,416
They want to bury him.

1593
02:17:41,461 --> 02:17:42,628
Yes.

1594
02:17:44,130 --> 02:17:46,924
If this is love, I do not want it.

1595
02:17:50,303 --> 02:17:52,054
Take it from me.

1596
02:17:52,806 --> 02:17:54,390
Please.

1597
02:17:59,854 --> 02:18:02,481
[voice breaking]
Why does it hurt so much?

1598
02:18:03,525 --> 02:18:05,567
Because it was real.

1599
02:18:47,027 --> 02:18:48,652
[sighs]

1600
02:20:10,360 --> 02:20:12,069
[horns blowing]

1601
02:22:13,441 --> 02:22:16,652
The King is dead.

1602
02:22:17,195 --> 02:22:19,905
Long live the King!

1603
02:22:20,156 --> 02:22:21,532
Long live the King!

1604
02:22:30,667 --> 02:22:32,834
There is to be a great feast tonight.

1605
02:22:33,086 --> 02:22:36,338
Songs will be sung. Tales will be told.

1606
02:22:37,090 --> 02:22:39,216
And Thorin Oakenshield   

1607
02:22:39,467 --> 02:22:41,510
   will pass into legend.

1608
02:22:42,845 --> 02:22:44,555
I know that's how you must honor him.

1609
02:22:44,806 --> 02:22:46,682
But to me, he was never that.

1610
02:22:47,892 --> 02:22:49,142
He was   

1611
02:22:50,520 --> 02:22:51,812
To me   

1612
02:22:53,606 --> 02:22:54,856
   he was   

1613
02:23:01,990 --> 02:23:04,950
Well, I think I'll slip quietly away.
Will you tell the others I said goodbye?

1614
02:23:05,201 --> 02:23:06,994
You can tell them yourself.

1615
02:23:23,303 --> 02:23:26,638
If any of you are ever
passing Bag End, uh   

1616
02:23:31,728 --> 02:23:33,020
   tea is at 4.

1617
02:23:34,647 --> 02:23:36,231
There's plenty of it.

1618
02:23:38,860 --> 02:23:40,777
You are welcome anytime.

1619
02:23:46,743 --> 02:23:48,118
Uh   

1620
02:23:49,537 --> 02:23:51,038
Don't bother knocking.

1621
02:23:51,289 --> 02:23:52,539
[all chuckle]

1622
02:24:32,121 --> 02:24:33,372
[Gandalf chuckles]

1623
02:24:33,623 --> 02:24:35,791
Ah, the borders of the Shire.

1624
02:24:37,752 --> 02:24:39,544
It is here I must leave you.

1625
02:24:42,215 --> 02:24:43,590
That's a shame.

1626
02:24:46,135 --> 02:24:47,803
I quite liked having   

1627
02:24:48,054 --> 02:24:49,763
   a Wizard around.

1628
02:24:51,015 --> 02:24:52,766
Seems they bring good luck.

1629
02:24:53,851 --> 02:24:57,229
You don't really suppose, do you,
that all your adventures and escapes   

1630
02:24:57,480 --> 02:24:59,648
   were managed by mere luck?

1631
02:25:00,650 --> 02:25:03,819
Magic rings should not be used lightly,
Bilbo.

1632
02:25:04,070 --> 02:25:05,362
Don't take me for a fool.

1633
02:25:05,613 --> 02:25:08,073
I know you found one in the Goblin tunnels.

1634
02:25:08,324 --> 02:25:10,367
And I've kept my eye on you   

1635
02:25:10,618 --> 02:25:11,702
   ever since.

1636
02:25:14,872 --> 02:25:16,456
Well, thank goodness.

1637
02:25:21,170 --> 02:25:22,796
Farewell, Gandalf.

1638
02:25:25,717 --> 02:25:27,134
Farewell.

1639
02:25:34,308 --> 02:25:35,559
You, uh   

1640
02:25:35,810 --> 02:25:39,438
You needn't worry about that ring.
It fell out of my pocket during the battle.

1641
02:25:39,689 --> 02:25:40,772
I lost it.

1642
02:25:41,691 --> 02:25:44,985
You're a very fine person, Mr. Baggins

1643
02:25:45,945 --> 02:25:46,945
and I'm very fond   

1644
02:25:47,196 --> 02:25:48,363
   of you,

1645
02:25:50,074 --> 02:25:52,409
but you're only quite a little fellow   

1646
02:25:53,661 --> 02:25:56,496
   in a wide world after all.

1647
02:26:14,766 --> 02:26:16,308
[Hobbit's chattering]

1648
02:26:27,779 --> 02:26:30,655
Wait a minute,
that's my mother's glory box.

1649
02:26:30,907 --> 02:26:33,200
And that's my dining chair.

1650
02:26:33,451 --> 02:26:36,453
Ah     Put that pouf down!

1651
02:26:36,704 --> 02:26:38,205
What is going on?

1652
02:26:38,790 --> 02:26:39,790
Hello   

1653
02:26:39,916 --> 02:26:40,916
   Mr. Bilbo.

1654
02:26:41,042 --> 02:26:42,667
You're not supposed to be here.

1655
02:26:42,919 --> 02:26:44,544
What do you mean?

1656
02:26:44,796 --> 02:26:46,379
On account of you being presumed dead.

1657
02:26:47,340 --> 02:26:48,799
I am not dead,

1658
02:26:49,050 --> 02:26:50,884
presumed or otherwise.

1659
02:26:52,011 --> 02:26:53,929
I'm not sure that's permitted.

1660
02:26:54,180 --> 02:26:55,764
Mr. Bilbo!

1661
02:26:56,015 --> 02:26:58,433
Twenty-one! Any advance on 21?

1662
02:26:58,684 --> 02:27:00,435
Any advance on 21?

1663
02:27:00,812 --> 02:27:03,563
Ha, ha! Sold to Mrs. Bolger.

1664
02:27:03,815 --> 02:27:06,191
Somewhere for Fatty to put his feet on.

1665
02:27:07,068 --> 02:27:08,068
[all laughing]

1666
02:27:08,319 --> 02:27:09,361
Any bids for this?

1667
02:27:09,612 --> 02:27:11,947
This is Shire-made.

1668
02:27:12,198 --> 02:27:13,990
None of those Dwarvish reproductions here.

1669
02:27:14,242 --> 02:27:15,242
Stop!

1670
02:27:15,493 --> 02:27:16,743
Stop!

1671
02:27:16,994 --> 02:27:19,037
There's been a mistake!
Who are you, young man?

1672
02:27:19,288 --> 02:27:20,288
What do you mean, who am I?

1673
02:27:20,540 --> 02:27:21,998
You know very well who I am,   

1674
02:27:22,250 --> 02:27:24,084
   Lobelia Sackville-Baggins.

1675
02:27:24,335 --> 02:27:25,710
This is my home

1676
02:27:25,962 --> 02:27:28,213
and those are my spoons.
Thank you very much.

1677
02:27:28,464 --> 02:27:30,184
This is most irregular.
Excuse me.

1678
02:27:30,341 --> 02:27:31,341
It's been more   

1679
02:27:31,425 --> 02:27:33,718
   than 13 months since the disappearance.

1680
02:27:33,970 --> 02:27:35,595
If you are in fact   

1681
02:27:35,847 --> 02:27:38,890
   Bilbo Baggins and undeceased   

1682
02:27:39,141 --> 02:27:40,684
   can you prove it?

1683
02:27:40,935 --> 02:27:41,935
What?

1684
02:27:41,978 --> 02:27:43,603
Something official with your name   

1685
02:27:43,855 --> 02:27:44,938
   on it would suffice.

1686
02:27:45,189 --> 02:27:47,065
All right. Right.

1687
02:27:47,316 --> 02:27:49,234
[crowd murmuring]

1688
02:27:49,944 --> 02:27:52,237
A contract of employment as a bur   

1689
02:27:54,907 --> 02:27:55,907
Never mind as what.

1690
02:27:57,869 --> 02:27:59,244
There. My signature.

1691
02:27:59,495 --> 02:28:01,496
Yes, well    Uh   

1692
02:28:01,747 --> 02:28:03,582
Well, it certainly seems to be in order.

1693
02:28:03,833 --> 02:28:04,958
Yes.

1694
02:28:05,209 --> 02:28:07,252
Seems there can be no doubt.

1695
02:28:08,212 --> 02:28:10,088
Who is this you pledged your service to?

1696
02:28:12,133 --> 02:28:13,675
Thorin Oakenshield?

1697
02:28:17,138 --> 02:28:18,138
He   

1698
02:28:19,223 --> 02:28:20,765
He was my friend.

1699
02:30:12,503 --> 02:30:14,004
[knocking on door]

1700
02:30:15,715 --> 02:30:17,132
No, thank you!

1701
02:30:17,383 --> 02:30:19,551
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers   

1702
02:30:19,802 --> 02:30:22,012
   or distant relations!

1703
02:30:22,263 --> 02:30:23,346
What about   

1704
02:30:23,597 --> 02:30:25,348
   very old friends?

1705
02:30:32,940 --> 02:30:33,940
Gandalf?

1706
02:30:34,150 --> 02:30:35,442
Bilbo Baggins.

1707
02:30:35,693 --> 02:30:37,652
My dear Gandalf! Ha, ha!

1708
02:30:37,903 --> 02:30:39,112
It's good to see you.

1709
02:30:39,363 --> 02:30:42,949
One hundred and 11 years old.
Who would believe it?

1710
02:30:43,909 --> 02:30:45,493
[both laughing]

1711
02:30:47,163 --> 02:30:49,122
Come on, come in!

1712
02:30:49,373 --> 02:30:51,666
Welcome. Welcome.
