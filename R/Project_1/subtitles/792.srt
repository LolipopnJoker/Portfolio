1
00:00:52,374 --> 00:00:54,565
Ticket, please.

2
00:01:01,483 --> 00:01:04,413
Ticket, please.

3
00:01:12,527 --> 00:01:15,218
Ticket, miss.

4
00:01:16,564 --> 00:01:18,755
Have a good trip.

5
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,579
Excuse me.
Is this seat taken?

6
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,771
No.

7
00:01:50,465 --> 00:01:52,895
I love ballet.

8
00:01:54,502 --> 00:01:56,795
Now, I never had the body for it.

9
00:01:58,373 --> 00:02:00,607
Hey, you dance?

10
00:02:00,608 --> 00:02:03,470
I used to.

11
00:02:14,022 --> 00:02:16,747
I've got something for you.

12
00:02:19,027 --> 00:02:21,695
It's for love, not luck.

13
00:02:21,696 --> 00:02:25,866
Because you don't need luck,
you dance like an angel.

14
00:02:25,867 --> 00:02:27,868
Mom.

15
00:02:27,869 --> 00:02:31,971
You're the best luck
I'll ever have.

16
00:02:38,747 --> 00:02:41,048
Are you okay?

17
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:43,050
I kept messing up
these pirouettes.

18
00:02:43,051 --> 00:02:45,152
It's really frustrating,
but it'll be okay.

19
00:02:45,153 --> 00:02:47,454
My mom's going to be there.
She's going to drive me.

20
00:02:47,455 --> 00:02:50,124
You've nothing to worry about,
you're going to do absolutely fine.

21
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,326
You're the best dancer
in Lemont.

22
00:02:52,327 --> 00:02:55,596
Lindsay, this is not Lemont.
This is Juilliard, New York City.

23
00:02:55,597 --> 00:02:57,598
- Do you want to pray?
- What?

24
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,801
You're leaving for St. Louis. I'm
not gonna see you. We should pray.

25
00:03:00,802 --> 00:03:03,670
- Lindsay...
- Father, S.J. auditions today,

26
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:05,739
let herdo okay.

27
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,008
We've got the Carson
wedding, the Dankowski party,

28
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:11,445
two funerals and Jill
calls in sick today, of all days.

29
00:03:11,446 --> 00:03:16,283
Sara, I'm sorry. I have to handle
this, there isn't anybody else.

30
00:03:16,284 --> 00:03:18,719
- Mom, what about...
- Glynn? Do they want roses in this?

31
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,389
- It doesn't say what color mums.
- Judy took that order, ask her.

32
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,225
Mom? This is the hardest,
most important day of my life.

33
00:03:25,226 --> 00:03:28,896
You have to be there.
You promised.

34
00:03:28,897 --> 00:03:31,497
I know.

35
00:03:42,744 --> 00:03:45,546
- Excuse me, are you Sara Johnson?
- Yes.

36
00:03:45,547 --> 00:03:47,738
You're next.

37
00:04:07,802 --> 00:04:11,301
I'll be there, I promise,
before you audition.

38
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,952
Is there anything you
would like to share with us...

39
00:04:24,953 --> 00:04:27,087
about your contemporary piece
before you begin?

40
00:04:27,088 --> 00:04:30,280
No, it's pretty
self-explanatory.

41
00:06:13,361 --> 00:06:15,362
Did you have a good ride?

42
00:06:15,363 --> 00:06:18,054
I slept through most of it.

43
00:06:20,568 --> 00:06:22,569
I guess you got stuff.

44
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,871
Baggage?

45
00:06:24,872 --> 00:06:28,735
Three suitcases.
One big one.

46
00:06:41,122 --> 00:06:44,791
Sorry I had to split
so soon after the funeral.

47
00:06:44,792 --> 00:06:47,661
If I could have gotten out of
that gig in South Bend,

48
00:06:47,662 --> 00:06:50,130
I would have hung around
a lot longer.

49
00:06:50,131 --> 00:06:52,663
Guess it was pretty tough
leaving all your friends.

50
00:07:23,756 --> 00:07:25,947
Here we are.

51
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:29,227
Put 'em anywhere.

52
00:07:29,228 --> 00:07:32,730
Give you the grand tour.

53
00:07:32,731 --> 00:07:34,732
It's not much of what
you're used to,

54
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:37,668
but the water's hot
and the mice are friendly.

55
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:40,497
Bathroom.

56
00:07:42,474 --> 00:07:44,608
Kitchen, big kitchen.

57
00:07:50,115 --> 00:07:52,550
This is where I sleep.

58
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:56,220
Didn't get a chance
to make the bed today.

59
00:07:56,221 --> 00:07:58,412
Where do I sleep?

60
00:08:01,326 --> 00:08:03,461
Nixon was probably in offiice...

61
00:08:03,462 --> 00:08:06,030
when they rolled this
off the assembly line, but,

62
00:08:06,031 --> 00:08:09,000
there's a brand-new mattress
in there.

63
00:08:09,001 --> 00:08:11,369
Most of your clothes
should fit in here.

64
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,938
Whatever's left over
can put in the hall closet.

65
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:16,174
I know it's a little bit
out in the open, but...

66
00:08:16,175 --> 00:08:19,367
I didn't get a chance
to fiinish your room here.

67
00:08:22,614 --> 00:08:25,009
Yeah, I'll fiix that.

68
00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:30,854
It's a work in progress.

69
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:35,359
I'll have it up and running
in no time.

70
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,256
A few minor adjustments.

71
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:45,359
Well, I guess
I'll let you get unpacked.

72
00:09:06,758 --> 00:09:08,860
You don't have
to come in with me...

73
00:09:08,861 --> 00:09:12,296
- since I'm allset.
- I'm your father, I'm supposed to.

74
00:09:12,297 --> 00:09:14,999
You don't know where to go,
who to see.

75
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,269
It's okay. I mean, I have done
this before, gone to school.

76
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:23,274
All right, well, this is
the name they gave me.

77
00:09:23,275 --> 00:09:26,808
"Mrs. Gwynn.
Main offiice."

78
00:09:27,846 --> 00:09:31,048
I'llbe back
to pick you up at 3..30.

79
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:34,218
Okay, sure.
Whatever.

80
00:09:46,532 --> 00:09:50,031
- Hey, look at the white girl.
- Wass up, baby?

81
00:10:45,524 --> 00:10:51,185
My door is always open. And contrary
to hall rumor, you can talk to me.

82
00:10:52,331 --> 00:10:56,467
Do you have any
questions or concerns?

83
00:10:56,468 --> 00:10:58,829
No questions, no answers.

84
00:11:00,372 --> 00:11:03,564
All right. This is Mr. Campbell's
class, and he's expecting you.

85
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:08,379
Truman Capote. In Cold Blood...

86
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,249
represents a complete turning point
in American history...

87
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:16,554
and American literature...
You want to tell us why, Mr. Ricard?

88
00:11:16,555 --> 00:11:19,223
Gay rights.

89
00:11:19,224 --> 00:11:22,059
- The Com-pote dude who wrote it...
- Capote.

90
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,794
- Capote?
- Capote.

91
00:11:23,795 --> 00:11:26,897
Sweet tooth. Straight-up fag,
Mr. C. I'm serious.

92
00:11:26,898 --> 00:11:29,834
Flaming.

93
00:11:29,835 --> 00:11:33,070
Thank you very much. We can now
promote you up to kindergarten.

94
00:11:33,071 --> 00:11:36,374
Anybody else?
Once, twice.

95
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:40,645
Miss Johnson, I apologize
if any of this is over your head,

96
00:11:40,646 --> 00:11:43,247
but if you see me after class,
I'll give you some chapters.

97
00:11:43,248 --> 00:11:45,850
Anybody?
Come on.

98
00:11:45,851 --> 00:11:48,919
It's a non-fiction novel.
Capote mixed true events...

99
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,190
with things that he couldn't
know so he made them up.

100
00:11:53,191 --> 00:11:55,325
He created a new genre.

101
00:11:57,062 --> 00:12:01,265
White folks back then felt safe.
Capote scared them.

102
00:12:01,266 --> 00:12:03,034
He took hard-core crime
out of the ghetto...

103
00:12:03,035 --> 00:12:06,404
and placed it in America's backyard,
that's what makes the book special.

104
00:12:06,405 --> 00:12:10,374
- Yeah, that's part of it.
- That's all of it.

105
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:14,211
- We got a debate going on now.
- Capote wasn't the fiirst.

106
00:12:14,212 --> 00:12:16,747
Richard Wright, James Baldwin
did the same thing.

107
00:12:16,748 --> 00:12:19,183
Wasn't nobody trying
to read them, though.

108
00:12:19,184 --> 00:12:22,753
A lot of people read them.

109
00:12:22,754 --> 00:12:25,356
A lot of people like who?

110
00:12:25,357 --> 00:12:27,525
You?

111
00:12:27,526 --> 00:12:31,595
- Didn't think so.
- Mr. C? Mr. C?

112
00:12:31,596 --> 00:12:34,365
- Yeah?
- Your girl needs to bone up.

113
00:12:34,366 --> 00:12:37,535
I think you need to give her
a pass to the library.

114
00:12:37,536 --> 00:12:40,571
We need to get a parent-teacher's
conference, something going on.

115
00:12:40,572 --> 00:12:42,606
Why don't you lend her yours?

116
00:12:42,607 --> 00:12:45,776
'Cause obviously,
you don't ever use it.

117
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:50,181
Yo, Latrice, Mr.Jackson's
civics class?

118
00:12:50,182 --> 00:12:54,485
You will have a pop quiz.
It's mad hard, aight?

119
00:12:54,486 --> 00:12:56,677
Aight.

120
00:13:12,671 --> 00:13:15,533
That's how easy it is
to give to charity around here.

121
00:13:17,409 --> 00:13:19,410
Thanks.

122
00:13:19,411 --> 00:13:23,707
Don't put your shit
on the floor.

123
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,351
I'm...

124
00:14:32,424 --> 00:14:34,425
So, here I am trying to study,
right?

125
00:14:34,426 --> 00:14:36,958
And he's crying and crying,
I can't get anything done...

126
00:14:40,766 --> 00:14:44,168
Yo, where were you
in math class? Man...

127
00:14:44,169 --> 00:14:47,538
It was so hard.
I left it blank, the whole thing.

128
00:14:47,539 --> 00:14:50,641
For real. And if you had been there,
I'd of had my notes from yesterday.

129
00:14:50,642 --> 00:14:53,311
I know you're new to the table,
but just look at this,

130
00:14:53,312 --> 00:14:57,048
we are the 2K generation...
and no one takes us seriously.

131
00:14:57,049 --> 00:15:00,451
We don't even take ourselves
seriously. And just look around,

132
00:15:00,452 --> 00:15:03,821
half the student body is DOA,
and that's from the neck up, Clara.

133
00:15:03,822 --> 00:15:05,823
Sara. It's Sara.

134
00:15:05,824 --> 00:15:09,394
Yeah, it's Sara.
You finished?

135
00:15:09,395 --> 00:15:11,324
Yes.

136
00:15:16,201 --> 00:15:19,237
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.

137
00:15:19,238 --> 00:15:21,239
You need to watch
where you sit, girl.

138
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,705
Don't ever let me catch you at
that table again. And it's Chenille.

139
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:29,113
Put your tray down here,
and let me introduce you...

140
00:15:29,114 --> 00:15:32,511
to some oft he ladies
that I roll with.

141
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,555
Come on.

142
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,596
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
Girls, this is Sara.

143
00:15:45,597 --> 00:15:48,499
Sara, this is Portia
and Tanisha.

144
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,169
And this is Diggy.

145
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,572
- She thinks she's down.
- Excuse me? I am down, okay.

146
00:15:54,573 --> 00:15:57,408
- Yeah, whatever.
- You said you knew how to play.

147
00:15:57,409 --> 00:16:00,411
Girl, that earring
is fresh as hell, did it hurt?

148
00:16:00,412 --> 00:16:02,280
Stick a pin
through your eye brow,

149
00:16:02,281 --> 00:16:04,972
- see if it hurts.
- Ass hole.

150
00:16:06,452 --> 00:16:10,588
Who? 'Cause in this crowd you're
going to have to be more specifiic.

151
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:13,691
The guy sitting by the window
with the blue sweater.

152
00:16:13,692 --> 00:16:16,761
He's in my English class.
He think she's so smart and so cute.

153
00:16:16,762 --> 00:16:19,530
- Derek Reynolds?
- So you know him?

154
00:16:19,531 --> 00:16:22,723
Hell, yeah, I know him.
He's my brother.

155
00:16:26,438 --> 00:16:30,165
Well, he's not an asshole,
per se...

156
00:16:31,877 --> 00:16:35,079
Forget about it, girl.
It's all right.

157
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,148
Don't even sweat it.

158
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:40,084
- Yo, Derek. Hey, yo.
- Hey, man.

159
00:16:40,085 --> 00:16:43,621
Medicine man.

160
00:16:43,622 --> 00:16:46,190
What's up, Kai? Man, baby,
I was just asking about you,

161
00:16:46,191 --> 00:16:49,093
and I got a little emotional
too about you being back and all.

162
00:16:49,094 --> 00:16:52,129
Man, sit your punk ass down, fool.
Matter offact, step your ass off.

163
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,265
Give us some space.

164
00:16:54,266 --> 00:16:58,202
Man, why we... Everybody's
got a piece in the hook.

165
00:16:58,203 --> 00:17:02,773
You look good, man.
Who you stealing from? Nice jacket.

166
00:17:02,774 --> 00:17:05,776
What's up, man?
How'd it go with Mrs. Gwynn?

167
00:17:05,777 --> 00:17:10,114
Bullshit. "You're a smart boy,
you can learn from your mistakes."

168
00:17:10,115 --> 00:17:12,583
"I'm here for you." Yeah,
she's there for me, all right.

169
00:17:12,584 --> 00:17:15,319
But you're hangin' in, though.
You feeling strong?

170
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:19,624
Strong about what? First week
back at home sweet high school?

171
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,626
You enlisted in this shit.
I'm drafted.

172
00:17:21,627 --> 00:17:23,761
Judge said finish school
or finish your sentence.

173
00:17:23,762 --> 00:17:26,631
Like they both ain't
12 months of a long-ass time.

174
00:17:26,632 --> 00:17:29,500
But a year here is better than
another one served up at juvee.

175
00:17:29,501 --> 00:17:33,871
- At least we got chicks in here.
- Yeah, man.

176
00:17:33,872 --> 00:17:35,506
- I'll check you later, man.
- All right, man.

177
00:17:35,507 --> 00:17:38,505
See this honey.

178
00:17:43,215 --> 00:17:46,646
Hey, Sara.
Come in here a minute, will you?

179
00:17:54,126 --> 00:17:57,028
You've been working a while in there.
You must be getting hungry.

180
00:17:57,029 --> 00:18:01,132
What do you say? Look...
"Swanson Hungry Man Dinners."

181
00:18:01,133 --> 00:18:04,735
They're the best.
Look, got everystyle.

182
00:18:04,736 --> 00:18:06,704
Animal, vegetable, or mineral?

183
00:18:06,705 --> 00:18:09,135
I had a big lunch.

184
00:18:10,442 --> 00:18:12,643
All right, well...

185
00:18:12,644 --> 00:18:15,335
they're in here
if you change your mind.

186
00:18:17,349 --> 00:18:20,651
Unless your plan is
to starve yourself to death.

187
00:18:20,652 --> 00:18:23,421
It's not a plan. I just don't eat
when I'm not hungry.

188
00:18:23,422 --> 00:18:26,090
- Mom never let me eat that stuff.
- Okay.

189
00:18:26,091 --> 00:18:29,021
Hey...

190
00:18:30,095 --> 00:18:33,064
Listen...

191
00:18:33,065 --> 00:18:37,501
I got a gig downtown tonight.
What do you say?

192
00:18:37,502 --> 00:18:39,804
You haven't heard me
play for awhile.

193
00:18:39,805 --> 00:18:43,708
What do you say?
You want to come with me,

194
00:18:43,709 --> 00:18:46,677
and hang out, and maybe we'll
get a bite to eat afterwards?

195
00:18:46,678 --> 00:18:50,514
- It's a school night, Roy.
- Yeah.

196
00:18:50,515 --> 00:18:52,583
It's a school night, yeah.

197
00:18:52,584 --> 00:18:55,219
I forgot.

198
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,684
All right, then.
Well, I'll just go.

199
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:05,229
And, you can eat or not eat.

200
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,421
And I'll be back when I'm back.

201
00:20:03,401 --> 00:20:07,137
Stepps is gonna be
off the hinges Friday night.

202
00:20:07,138 --> 00:20:10,240
I'm a bust a new move,
break in the new Jordans...

203
00:20:10,241 --> 00:20:12,242
and bring a little honey.

204
00:20:12,243 --> 00:20:14,911
Why, your hand busy?

205
00:20:14,912 --> 00:20:18,982
If it wasn't for that attitude,
you could be the lucky girl.

206
00:20:18,983 --> 00:20:22,019
- I can see us right now, baby.
- Yeah, in your dreams.

207
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,788
Help me, dog.
Defend me, man!

208
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:26,790
I got my own problems, Snook.

209
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:30,293
Problems? What problems?
We ain't got no damn problems.

210
00:20:30,294 --> 00:20:34,097
You going to college, doctor college
after that. You the man, dog.

211
00:20:34,098 --> 00:20:37,000
He tripping off his acceptance
letter from Georgetown.

212
00:20:37,001 --> 00:20:40,568
No, I'm waiting for my letter.
I've been waiting.

213
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:52,616
I could have been a doctor
too, you know what I'm saying?

214
00:20:52,617 --> 00:20:54,751
If it wasn't for that time
I got left back.

215
00:20:54,752 --> 00:20:58,889
"That time"? What, fifth
and sixth grade don't count?

216
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,426
Why do you always try to make me
feel bad? I liked the fifth grade.

217
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:06,163
- Hey, girl!
- Miss Barnett had this ass so big...

218
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:08,799
This is my brother, Derek.

219
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,301
My bad, y'all have already met.

220
00:21:11,302 --> 00:21:14,504
- Yeah, we're acquainted.
- Hi.

221
00:21:14,505 --> 00:21:17,474
- Hi.
- Hell, no!

222
00:21:17,475 --> 00:21:21,678
You're not going to introduce me?
Forget my name, your manners?

223
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,680
You don't need to know him.

224
00:21:23,681 --> 00:21:27,184
Excuse me, you do need to know me.
Everybody needs to know me.

225
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:31,688
They call me Snook-G, from the CG.
And don't you forget it.

226
00:21:31,689 --> 00:21:34,458
They call him Snookie,
because "fool" was taken.

227
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:38,628
They call me Snook,
the cootchie crook.

228
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:42,788
Chi-town, where ya at, girl?
What's your fiirst class?

229
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:46,870
Okay, let's see that upper body.

230
00:21:46,871 --> 00:21:49,206
Both legs, nice.

231
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:51,975
- Let's... The upper body.
- I can't. I know.

232
00:21:51,976 --> 00:21:54,478
- I don't have an upper body.
- We go through this every day.

233
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,647
You need to work your upper body.
Go do some chin-ups.

234
00:21:57,648 --> 00:22:01,985
Stacia, you're next. Kathy,
spot her. Good. Point your toes.

235
00:22:01,986 --> 00:22:04,245
That's it.

236
00:22:07,792 --> 00:22:10,961
All right, Sara.
You're up.

237
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:13,063
Ihate this class!

238
00:22:13,064 --> 00:22:15,098
- Look at my hand!
- Girl, you are bleeding.

239
00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:18,768
I hate her. She made me climb up to
the very... well, not the very top.

240
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:22,735
Obviously.

241
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,677
Damn.

242
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:50,033
Ex-cuuse me!

243
00:22:50,034 --> 00:22:52,936
Last time you said
you would and you didn't.

244
00:22:52,937 --> 00:22:56,106
Wait. Hold on, hold on.

245
00:22:56,107 --> 00:22:58,475
Sara.

246
00:22:58,476 --> 00:23:01,244
- Hi.
- Hi.

247
00:23:01,245 --> 00:23:03,547
How you get your leg
to twist like that?

248
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,950
What's up with that double-jointed,
cheerleader shit anyway?

249
00:23:06,951 --> 00:23:11,488
Nothing's up with it. I just
used to dance. Ballet, mostly.

250
00:23:11,489 --> 00:23:15,559
So you should hit Stepps
with us tomorrow night.

251
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,929
It's a club. You know,
like mostly hip-hop.

252
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:22,666
It's sort of members only,
you know what I'm saying?

253
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:25,402
I don't know.

254
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:28,705
- You should go.
- Yeah, Snook spins sometimes,

255
00:23:28,706 --> 00:23:32,342
- so he might be able to get you in.
- Who?

256
00:23:32,343 --> 00:23:36,613
Snook, she needs to get hooked up
with Stepps, all the way hooked up.

257
00:23:36,614 --> 00:23:38,982
- All right. Give him a twenty.
- For what?

258
00:23:38,983 --> 00:23:40,984
L.D.

259
00:23:40,985 --> 00:23:43,453
She thought she was
getting in off your looks.

260
00:23:43,454 --> 00:23:46,179
Ha! No, no.

261
00:23:47,758 --> 00:23:51,261
Your girl is weak, all right?
I got my rep to watch.

262
00:23:51,262 --> 00:23:54,798
I can't be getting any old
toe-tapping, ass-shaking band stand...

263
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,833
Snookie, you talk a lot of shit
for someone who never says anything.

264
00:24:04,175 --> 00:24:06,468
You gonna pay the man, or what?

265
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,950
- I don't know where it is.
- I'll give you my address.

266
00:24:13,951 --> 00:24:16,386
We'll meet up,
and we'll go together.

267
00:24:16,387 --> 00:24:19,322
And I will have your l.D.

268
00:24:19,323 --> 00:24:21,891
Stepps ain't no square dance.

269
00:24:21,892 --> 00:24:24,253
That's all right. I dance
in circles, probably around you.

270
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:30,133
- This girl's a joke, man.
- What? Break out.

271
00:24:30,134 --> 00:24:35,067
Don't you got something to do?
Money to spend? Allright.

272
00:24:37,508 --> 00:24:40,040
Let's roll, girl.

273
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:08,038
Hey, girl.
Come in.

274
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:11,141
- So you found the place okay?
- Yeah, it was fiine.

275
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:14,334
All right, I'm just gonna get
my coat and then we'll be out.

276
00:25:25,556 --> 00:25:29,125
Cool outfit.

277
00:25:29,126 --> 00:25:31,988
Slammin'.
Slammin' outfiit.

278
00:25:34,231 --> 00:25:37,100
Momma Dean?
I'm leaving.

279
00:25:37,101 --> 00:25:40,134
L-I look okay, right?

280
00:25:41,572 --> 00:25:44,074
Yeah.

281
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:46,443
You look all right.

282
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:50,580
Momma Dean, Sara.
Sara, Mom, aka Momma Dean.

283
00:25:50,581 --> 00:25:52,816
Hi, sweetheart.
How are you?

284
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:56,486
And handsome here
is Christopher.

285
00:25:56,487 --> 00:25:59,356
Now don't get him
all riled up, Chenille.

286
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:03,226
I'm gonna get me
some sleep tonight.

287
00:26:03,227 --> 00:26:06,089
- Glad to have met you.
- Bye.

288
00:26:08,933 --> 00:26:11,863
I'll be home at 1:00
at the latest.

289
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,906
Is that... Is he yours?

290
00:26:16,907 --> 00:26:19,371
He sure ain't Momma Dean's.

291
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:29,548
- Here is your l.D.
- Thank you.

292
00:26:30,521 --> 00:26:33,957
Chenille!
She's ugly! She's fat.

293
00:26:33,958 --> 00:26:38,695
She's 21 . Come on, girl,
let's roll. I ain't got all night.

294
00:26:38,696 --> 00:26:42,059
Wait, wait, I just have to ask you
a question. Do I really look okay?

295
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:47,103
Yo, Lakisha,
let me use your car.

296
00:26:47,104 --> 00:26:49,105
I just want to sit
in it for a minute.

297
00:26:49,106 --> 00:26:51,775
- All right?
- All right.

298
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,777
- Come on.
- What? I-l thought...

299
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:58,481
- Get in. Let's go, let's go.
- Okay.

300
00:26:58,482 --> 00:27:02,673
All right, you need to take off
that fiifth-grade, dance-looking top.

301
00:27:02,674 --> 00:27:05,442
- It's from the Gap.
- It's country,

302
00:27:05,443 --> 00:27:07,444
and you look country in it.

303
00:27:07,445 --> 00:27:09,446
Let's go.

304
00:27:09,447 --> 00:27:12,783
You're going to
put these on too.

305
00:27:12,784 --> 00:27:15,043
What the hell am I
going to do with this?

306
00:27:17,789 --> 00:27:19,980
Come here, come here, come here.

307
00:27:24,963 --> 00:27:27,131
- Thanks, girl.
- No problem.

308
00:27:29,367 --> 00:27:31,501
Let's bounce.

309
00:27:33,805 --> 00:27:37,668
- Yo, you got a pocket for this cash?
- Yeah.

310
00:27:52,924 --> 00:27:56,560
Let's get to our table before
it gets crashed and I hurt somebody.

311
00:27:56,561 --> 00:27:58,862
What are you,
some kind ofV.l.P.?

312
00:27:58,863 --> 00:28:01,122
No, Snook hooks me up
when he spins.

313
00:28:12,911 --> 00:28:16,847
Damn!

314
00:28:16,848 --> 00:28:20,918
- Hey, hey. You got it. Got it.
- Got what?

315
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:24,888
What? The right to walk past
your greasy, tickle-dick self...

316
00:28:24,889 --> 00:28:27,191
- without your paws on my ass?
- Yeah. You got it.

317
00:28:27,192 --> 00:28:29,893
That's how I got it?

318
00:28:29,894 --> 00:28:33,962
That's how I thought
I had it. Come on, girl.

319
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:09,299
- Hey, what's up?
- We're in here.

320
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,836
Shawna! Sara, Shawna.
Shawna, Sara.

321
00:29:12,837 --> 00:29:16,340
Hi, love.
So, this place is tight, right?

322
00:29:16,341 --> 00:29:20,377
- It's so cool.
- What is up with this place?

323
00:29:20,378 --> 00:29:22,813
Seems like they're letting
anybody in.

324
00:29:22,814 --> 00:29:25,778
And they started with you.

325
00:29:26,918 --> 00:29:30,254
I'm Nikki.
Alyssa, Jasmin.

326
00:29:30,255 --> 00:29:32,790
You know Diggy, right, Marcia?

327
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:35,926
Sara.
It's Sara, actually.

328
00:29:35,927 --> 00:29:38,262
I know you, though.
You're in my gym class, right?

329
00:29:38,263 --> 00:29:41,799
- That don't mean you know me.
- Quit it, Nikki.

330
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,601
Quit what?
I ain't walking on eggshells...

331
00:29:44,602 --> 00:29:47,638
just 'cause you brought
the Brady Bunch to the Negro club.

332
00:29:47,639 --> 00:29:49,640
Maybe you came to
the wrong spot,

333
00:29:49,641 --> 00:29:51,809
'cause I'm pretty sure
there aren't any Negroes here.

334
00:29:52,777 --> 00:29:55,646
Doh!

335
00:29:55,647 --> 00:29:57,981
I'm pretty sure
you came with one.

336
00:29:57,982 --> 00:30:01,718
No, wench.
You did not just call me a Negro!

337
00:30:01,719 --> 00:30:05,155
- Y'all just chill, okay.
- Why don't you tell her to chill?

338
00:30:05,156 --> 00:30:07,357
She the one that's
always got something to say.

339
00:30:07,358 --> 00:30:11,095
I could say a lot more.
You keep talking, Nikki,

340
00:30:11,096 --> 00:30:14,288
I will lay all your shit bare.

341
00:30:24,843 --> 00:30:28,579
Dang. Why you gotta
burn her like that, Chenille?

342
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:32,739
'Cause I can't stand her ass
and the way she played my brother.

343
00:30:47,065 --> 00:30:49,460
Hey.

344
00:30:53,004 --> 00:30:55,729
- Hi, what's up, D.!
- Hey, man.

345
00:31:02,147 --> 00:31:05,646
- Let's dance.
- Let's not.

346
00:31:06,751 --> 00:31:09,753
It's gonna be like that?

347
00:31:09,754 --> 00:31:11,688
Well, how'd you think
it was gonna be?

348
00:31:11,689 --> 00:31:14,892
You was going to drop me and pick
me up wheneveryou felt like it?

349
00:31:14,893 --> 00:31:17,194
I miss you.

350
00:31:17,195 --> 00:31:20,631
Does this have to do with that fool
from Northwestern dismissing you?

351
00:31:20,632 --> 00:31:25,135
Ain't nobody dissed or dismissed me,
Derek. I laid him off.

352
00:31:25,136 --> 00:31:29,439
Fired me?
You laid him off?

353
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,541
All you gotta do is fiind somebody
to dance with and it'll be good.

354
00:31:38,716 --> 00:31:42,875
- What's up? What did he say?
- He's trippin', come on.

355
00:31:43,755 --> 00:31:46,456
Yo!
Excuse me!

356
00:31:46,457 --> 00:31:48,959
- Wanna dance with me for a minute?
- Yeah.

357
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,961
- Catch you later, all right?
- All right.

358
00:31:50,962 --> 00:31:53,964
What you drinking?

359
00:31:53,965 --> 00:31:57,768
- I don't know. I'll have, um...
- That's him coming over.

360
00:31:57,769 --> 00:32:00,571
- Who?
- Christopher's father.

361
00:32:00,572 --> 00:32:04,640
Don't look, don't look.
Don't.

362
00:32:13,318 --> 00:32:16,587
How you doing?

363
00:32:16,588 --> 00:32:19,189
Why don't you ask
how your son is doing?

364
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:21,792
That's a line
you ain't tried in awhile.

365
00:32:21,793 --> 00:32:24,861
Now why you got to
jump off like that?

366
00:32:24,862 --> 00:32:26,863
Why you gotta be like you are?

367
00:32:26,864 --> 00:32:29,866
I thought you was coming
to get Christopher on Sunday.

368
00:32:29,867 --> 00:32:32,669
What happened?
You got amnesia?

369
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:34,671
Look, I'll take him next week.

370
00:32:34,672 --> 00:32:37,007
I had to work on Sunday.

371
00:32:37,008 --> 00:32:39,309
I ain't seen
the fruits of that labor.

372
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,311
Come on, Chenille.

373
00:32:41,312 --> 00:32:43,742
Chenille.

374
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:48,352
I mean, you know
you want to dance with me.

375
00:32:48,353 --> 00:32:50,621
That's why you came here...

376
00:32:50,622 --> 00:32:53,655
To yell at me
and to dance with me.

377
00:33:00,365 --> 00:33:03,233
Kenny, Sara.
Sara, Kenny.

378
00:33:03,234 --> 00:33:06,096
- Hi.
- Hey, what's up?

379
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,531
Rum and coke.
No ice.

380
00:33:15,847 --> 00:33:17,981
Hey!

381
00:34:06,364 --> 00:34:10,867
Rum and coke, straight up,
and a beer... anything.

382
00:34:10,868 --> 00:34:14,004
That's a bad choice,
"anything."

383
00:34:14,005 --> 00:34:16,006
It's just a beer.

384
00:34:16,007 --> 00:34:18,508
Well, it should be
the best beer.

385
00:34:18,509 --> 00:34:21,411
But you'd know that
if you even drank.

386
00:34:21,412 --> 00:34:23,513
Whatever.

387
00:34:23,514 --> 00:34:26,716
What's that mean?
"Whatever"?

388
00:34:26,717 --> 00:34:30,220
Whatever you want it to mean.
You're the genius, right?

389
00:34:30,221 --> 00:34:32,455
- You know everything.
- Not everything.

390
00:34:32,456 --> 00:34:34,891
Like I don't know why
we're still standing here.

391
00:34:34,892 --> 00:34:37,928
I'm supposed to be
dizzy by now, remember?

392
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:40,564
From all those circles
you danced around me.

393
00:34:40,565 --> 00:34:43,733
I don't feel like
dancing right now.

394
00:34:43,734 --> 00:34:47,237
- But you know how?
- Would I be here, if I didn't?

395
00:34:47,238 --> 00:34:49,998
Let's do it then.
Come on.

396
00:34:53,444 --> 00:34:56,340
Come on.

397
00:36:02,213 --> 00:36:05,315
Cross, front.
Cross, front.

398
00:36:05,316 --> 00:36:07,851
That's it.
That's it. You got it.

399
00:36:07,852 --> 00:36:10,186
Cross, front.
Cross, front...

400
00:36:10,187 --> 00:36:12,722
- Shit!
- Sorry. Sorry.

401
00:36:12,723 --> 00:36:14,720
Sorry, I'm sorry.
Sorry.

402
00:36:23,901 --> 00:36:26,870
Damn, Nikki.
She all up in your nut.

403
00:36:26,871 --> 00:36:29,806
Up in your nut and cracking it.

404
00:36:29,807 --> 00:36:32,703
What she doing?
Two-stepping?

405
00:36:35,212 --> 00:36:38,711
I don't care what she's doing.
That bitch ain't got shit on me.

406
00:37:08,846 --> 00:37:11,207
He's right there.

407
00:37:38,976 --> 00:37:41,811
Don't be dealing in here.

408
00:37:41,812 --> 00:37:43,946
What the hell is wrong with you?

409
00:38:07,238 --> 00:38:10,907
I tell you, don't sell in here!
Malakai, you hear me, man.

410
00:38:10,908 --> 00:38:14,202
Y'all think it's a game, man?

411
00:38:17,748 --> 00:38:19,916
Kai!

412
00:38:19,917 --> 00:38:23,609
- Get up! Get up!
- All right, it's over. Chill.

413
00:38:28,993 --> 00:38:32,929
- Get off!
- I'm all right.

414
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:35,121
Move, move.
Keep going.

415
00:38:40,371 --> 00:38:43,062
Go, go, go, go, go.

416
00:38:57,288 --> 00:39:00,690
I gotta fiind my brother.
Derek! Derek!

417
00:39:00,691 --> 00:39:03,927
It's about to get real out here,
y'all. Cops and shit, I'm gone.

418
00:39:03,928 --> 00:39:06,289
All right, girl.
Derek!

419
00:39:07,531 --> 00:39:11,167
Derek!
Yo, what the...

420
00:39:11,168 --> 00:39:14,571
- Go.
- Come on, man, get in. Let'sgo.

421
00:39:14,572 --> 00:39:17,297
Are you crazy?
What's wrong with you, Derek?

422
00:39:22,813 --> 00:39:25,348
Look, I'm going to tell you
like I've been telling you,

423
00:39:25,349 --> 00:39:29,586
you need to leave Malakai alone and
let that scrub handle his own mess.

424
00:39:29,587 --> 00:39:32,355
Chenille, scramble the CD. I ain't
trying to hear all that shit.

425
00:39:32,356 --> 00:39:35,125
You guys, I live like fiive blocks
that way. I'm just going to go home.

426
00:39:35,126 --> 00:39:38,495
- I'll see you later.
- No, not alone in this neighborhood.

427
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:41,030
There's too many little boys
out here thinking they thugs.

428
00:39:41,031 --> 00:39:43,399
- I'll walk you.
- No, don't worry about me.

429
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,069
- It's no problem.
- No, I said I'll walkyou.

430
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:50,907
- Well, what about you?
- We live right around the corner.

431
00:39:50,908 --> 00:39:53,176
- Well, I'll be home in a minute.
- All right.

432
00:39:53,177 --> 00:39:56,112
So you was working it
tonight, girl.

433
00:39:56,113 --> 00:39:59,716
- Yeah, right, slammin'.
- Later.

434
00:39:59,717 --> 00:40:01,718
Bye.

435
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:04,012
Come on, Braveheart.

436
00:40:07,925 --> 00:40:09,926
Maybe you want to
hook up sometime?

437
00:40:09,927 --> 00:40:13,429
You know, after school?
Work on your moves, if you want.

438
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:16,065
Yeah, sure, if you want.

439
00:40:16,066 --> 00:40:21,237
So how'd you like Stepps,
once you got used to the music?

440
00:40:21,238 --> 00:40:23,640
It wasn't the music that I
had to get used to, Derek.

441
00:40:23,641 --> 00:40:26,376
That's not the fiirst time
I've heard hip-hop.

442
00:40:26,377 --> 00:40:31,173
I bet you listen to it
all the time.

443
00:40:34,451 --> 00:40:36,452
So are we getting any closer
to your crib,

444
00:40:36,453 --> 00:40:39,856
or are we going to have to
stop for food and water?

445
00:40:39,857 --> 00:40:42,548
- We... We passed it.
- You passed it.

446
00:40:49,567 --> 00:40:52,835
- Thank you for walking me home.
- Was that thanks like,

447
00:40:52,836 --> 00:40:55,205
"Gee whiz, I had a great time,"
or was that thanks like,

448
00:40:55,206 --> 00:40:58,575
"I'll bust a cap in your ass, if you
ever darken my doorstep again"?

449
00:40:58,576 --> 00:41:03,304
No, I would never
bust a cap in your ass.

450
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,769
Just checking.

451
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:13,538
So, you're here.
You're home.

452
00:41:13,539 --> 00:41:16,741
I'll see ya.

453
00:41:16,742 --> 00:41:18,610
See ya at school.

454
00:41:18,611 --> 00:41:21,146
Okay.

455
00:41:21,147 --> 00:41:23,915
See ya.

456
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:26,107
Thank you for the dance.

457
00:41:46,672 --> 00:41:49,774
- Morning.
- You scared me.

458
00:41:49,775 --> 00:41:53,144
I didn't know that you were home.
I didn't see your car outside.

459
00:41:53,145 --> 00:41:55,347
Yeah, the night's
full of surprises.

460
00:41:55,348 --> 00:41:58,850
I had a big one myself
when I came home on my break.

461
00:41:58,851 --> 00:42:03,154
- Where were you, Sara?
- I was just out with some friends.

462
00:42:03,155 --> 00:42:06,658
And I just missed some work. Half
a night's worth. Hope you had fun.

463
00:42:06,659 --> 00:42:09,127
I did.
I had a great time.

464
00:42:09,128 --> 00:42:11,830
Yeah, look,

465
00:42:11,831 --> 00:42:15,567
you're 17 years old,
if you wanna go out, go out.

466
00:42:15,568 --> 00:42:17,569
But don't sneak around.

467
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:20,972
And on top of everything else,
don't make me worry about you.

468
00:42:20,973 --> 00:42:23,141
Now you're worried about me?

469
00:42:23,142 --> 00:42:25,777
Now that I'm old enough to take care
of myself? Perfect timing, Roy.

470
00:42:25,778 --> 00:42:28,613
You know, the rules about going out
are very simple, Sara.

471
00:42:28,614 --> 00:42:32,484
I wanna know where and when. And
I want you home at a decent hour.

472
00:42:32,485 --> 00:42:37,281
- End of discussion.
- Fine, end of discussion. Relax.

473
00:42:42,328 --> 00:42:46,164
All right, lesson one. See, hip-hop
is more than just like a dance,

474
00:42:46,165 --> 00:42:48,199
it's more like...
Like an attitude, you know.

475
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:52,166
You gotta loosen up so you can feel
them and let them flow through you.

476
00:42:54,607 --> 00:42:57,208
Now, what is this?
Bring your feet out like this.

477
00:42:57,209 --> 00:42:59,878
Put your feet forward.
Right, spread 'em, spread 'em.

478
00:42:59,879 --> 00:43:02,213
- You all right, then?
- Yes.

479
00:43:02,214 --> 00:43:06,050
Just hang loose.
Be strong, a tree, right?

480
00:43:06,051 --> 00:43:10,483
Left, right, left, right,
left, right, left, right.

481
00:43:16,562 --> 00:43:20,892
Make that sound with me.

482
00:43:22,067 --> 00:43:25,937
What, are you sitting down
for tea or something?

483
00:43:25,938 --> 00:43:28,129
Get up.

484
00:43:29,408 --> 00:43:33,169
Boom. That's it.
Just chillin'.

485
00:43:36,048 --> 00:43:38,049
You just do it.
Sit down.

486
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:40,878
Okay.

487
00:43:45,591 --> 00:43:49,852
Now we're just going to walk. It's
real simple. Just walk like this.

488
00:43:53,799 --> 00:43:56,201
- Okay, now you try, you try.
- Okay.

489
00:43:56,202 --> 00:43:58,393
Now just relax,
let it be natural.

490
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:05,202
Five, six, seven, eight.

491
00:44:08,247 --> 00:44:11,177
Dig into it more, the balls of
your feet instead of your toes.

492
00:44:14,353 --> 00:44:17,989
Bend your knees, bend your knees.
Just slouch a little bit, slouch.

493
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:20,055
Act like you're a nasty bitch.

494
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,829
All right, now watch.
Check it, check it, check it.

495
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:28,533
- Got that?
- It's come to headbobs?

496
00:44:28,534 --> 00:44:30,835
Okay, it's the same beat,
but then you split it up.

497
00:44:30,836 --> 00:44:34,839
Freeze, freeze, freeze.

498
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,842
- Bounce, bounce.
- I am such a dork.

499
00:44:37,843 --> 00:44:40,478
No, you're not.
Bounce.

500
00:44:40,479 --> 00:44:43,807
- Now I'm cool.
- You're almost there.

501
00:44:45,084 --> 00:44:47,275
Yeah, you got that.

502
00:44:49,255 --> 00:44:51,256
Areyousure it's okay
that we came here?

503
00:44:51,257 --> 00:44:53,992
Well, it is now, but ifwe're
going to keep on doing this,

504
00:44:53,993 --> 00:44:56,184
we're gonna have to fiind
someplace else to practice.

505
00:44:59,732 --> 00:45:01,933
Did you always
want to be a doctor?

506
00:45:01,934 --> 00:45:04,202
Who said I wanna be a doctor?

507
00:45:04,203 --> 00:45:07,338
Chenille. Everybody.

508
00:45:08,507 --> 00:45:11,376
Well, yeah, you know.
I wanna be a doctor,

509
00:45:11,377 --> 00:45:13,778
but I gotta
get into college fiirst.

510
00:45:13,779 --> 00:45:16,948
What kind of doctor?

511
00:45:16,949 --> 00:45:19,481
Pediatrician.
I like kids.

512
00:45:21,487 --> 00:45:26,324
- Do you have any?
- No. Do you?

513
00:45:26,325 --> 00:45:29,517
I didn't...
I wasn't trying to be smart, Derek.

514
00:45:30,896 --> 00:45:32,897
Wouldn't be the fiirst time.

515
00:45:32,898 --> 00:45:35,466
Screw you,
I'm brilliant and cool.

516
00:45:35,467 --> 00:45:39,103
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

517
00:46:03,429 --> 00:46:06,331
That was cute, that little thing
you did. Can you show me again?

518
00:46:06,332 --> 00:46:10,802
- What was that shit you just did?
- Rond dejambe attitude.

519
00:46:10,803 --> 00:46:15,039
- Ballet. I used to dance.
- You used to dance?

520
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,042
Used to, as in don't anymore and no,
I don't want to talk about it.

521
00:46:18,043 --> 00:46:21,579
So, is that why you brought up that
rond dejambe attitude shit...

522
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:23,848
because you don't want
to talk about it?

523
00:46:23,849 --> 00:46:26,040
It's really not a big deal.

524
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,854
I think it is.

525
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:36,628
This club was so slamming, Lindsay,
the dancing. I'm gonna go again.

526
00:46:36,629 --> 00:46:39,797
You are? Well, have you
seen anybody get shot yet?

527
00:46:39,798 --> 00:46:42,567
What? No, I didn't see
anyone get shot yet.

528
00:46:42,568 --> 00:46:44,569
God, I didn't move to Bosnia.

529
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:46,571
Well, I'm still going to
pray for you.

530
00:46:46,572 --> 00:46:50,074
Jesus, Sara, you're in the freaking
ghetto. Forget about the drive-bys,

531
00:46:50,075 --> 00:46:52,977
how are you supposed to
meet anybody?

532
00:46:52,978 --> 00:46:58,783
Um, well, I did actually
meet somebody, I think.

533
00:46:58,784 --> 00:47:01,452
I met this guy,
and he's really cool.

534
00:47:01,453 --> 00:47:05,623
- They got white guys at your school?
- Um...

535
00:47:05,624 --> 00:47:08,850
no, actually they don't.

536
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:13,831
Shut up! Look at me.
I want my money.

537
00:47:13,832 --> 00:47:15,867
I don't have it.

538
00:47:15,868 --> 00:47:18,770
Shut up!
Quit your crying, man.

539
00:47:18,771 --> 00:47:20,772
I don't get paid till next week.

540
00:47:20,773 --> 00:47:22,774
You wasn't saying that
when you was smoking it.

541
00:47:22,775 --> 00:47:25,107
- I don't have it!
- Well, you better find it somewhere.

542
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:27,876
- This ain't no lay a way plan.
- Hey! Hey, stop it!

543
00:47:27,877 --> 00:47:31,714
Come here. Where do you
think you're going,

544
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:34,110
Aahh!
Bitch!

545
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:43,852
You ain't seen nothing,
so don't say nothing... to nobody.

546
00:48:02,085 --> 00:48:04,086
I stole a bike here once.

547
00:48:04,087 --> 00:48:06,689
- Why'd you do that?
- 'Cause I didn't have one.

548
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:10,459
- Okay. Good reason.
- Well, it's not a reason, you know,

549
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:13,496
I used to do shit like that,
you know... wild shit.

550
00:48:13,497 --> 00:48:15,998
- With Malakai?
- Yeah.

551
00:48:15,999 --> 00:48:18,690
I don't get you two.
You seem so different.

552
00:48:20,671 --> 00:48:23,606
- We're not.
- I think you are.

553
00:48:23,607 --> 00:48:26,475
I mean, come on,
Malakai's scary. Very scary.

554
00:48:26,476 --> 00:48:30,980
What you mean by scary?
Kai's tough, he has to be.

555
00:48:30,981 --> 00:48:35,885
But he's still got
a good heart. I know.

556
00:48:35,886 --> 00:48:37,887
Maybe you only think you know.

557
00:48:37,888 --> 00:48:40,990
Look, Malakai may not be the boy
next door, but he's still my boy.

558
00:48:40,991 --> 00:48:43,192
He does some shit that I'm not
down with sometimes,

559
00:48:43,193 --> 00:48:48,331
but I ain't never going to cross
him offand be like everybody else.

560
00:48:48,332 --> 00:48:51,467
So, you're not down with the stuff
he does, but you are down with him?

561
00:48:51,468 --> 00:48:55,137
- That makes sense. I understand.
- He's my friend, Sara.

562
00:48:55,138 --> 00:48:56,817
You don't have to understand.

563
00:48:56,818 --> 00:48:57,818
You don't have to understand.

564
00:48:57,819 --> 00:49:01,989
Listen, me and him got into some
shit awhile back... some bad shit.

565
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:04,992
Broke into a liquor store
and cracked open the cash register.

566
00:49:04,993 --> 00:49:06,994
Somebody peeped us
and called five-0,

567
00:49:06,995 --> 00:49:09,363
and we barely
made it out of the store.

568
00:49:09,364 --> 00:49:13,067
The cops were on our asses. We split
up and ran in different directions.

569
00:49:13,068 --> 00:49:15,069
Now, I must have been going
in the wrong direction,

570
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:17,071
because the cops
were closing in on me.

571
00:49:17,072 --> 00:49:20,408
So, Malakai, he smashed in some
car windows, set off the alarms...

572
00:49:20,409 --> 00:49:23,010
and turned the heat
from me to him.

573
00:49:23,011 --> 00:49:25,580
I kept running,
and he got caught.

574
00:49:25,581 --> 00:49:28,716
The DA offered him everything but
a Rolls Royce to turn my name in.

575
00:49:28,717 --> 00:49:31,750
But he didn't,
and he never will.

576
00:49:44,032 --> 00:49:46,767
I stole a hat once,
when I was 12.

577
00:49:46,768 --> 00:49:49,804
But my Mom found it
and made me give it back.

578
00:49:49,805 --> 00:49:54,008
Gangsta Sara stole a hat.
Call the F.B.l.

579
00:49:54,009 --> 00:49:56,077
Are you gonna turn me in?

580
00:49:56,078 --> 00:50:00,014
I think I'll wait
for you to surrender.

581
00:50:00,015 --> 00:50:03,384
So, you get along with your mom?

582
00:50:03,385 --> 00:50:05,720
You know, you all
tight and shit?

583
00:50:05,721 --> 00:50:09,991
Yeah. We got along,
tight and shit.

584
00:50:09,992 --> 00:50:13,160
- How come you never talk about her?
- 'Cause there's nothing to say.

585
00:50:13,161 --> 00:50:15,463
It's because you don't
talk about her.

586
00:50:15,464 --> 00:50:17,765
What do you want me to do?

587
00:50:17,766 --> 00:50:19,767
I don't know,
just say something about her.

588
00:50:19,768 --> 00:50:23,070
I mean, you don't
say anything about her.

589
00:50:23,071 --> 00:50:25,806
Well, she's dead. God,
what do you want me to do,

590
00:50:25,807 --> 00:50:28,809
- run through the streets screaming?
- If it helps.

591
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:31,274
Well, it won't, so drop it.

592
00:50:32,681 --> 00:50:35,016
Didn 't mean to press you
about your mom.

593
00:50:35,017 --> 00:50:36,584
It's all right.
Don't worry about it.

594
00:50:36,585 --> 00:50:40,488
Get along with your dad?
Y'all tight and shit?

595
00:50:40,489 --> 00:50:43,453
Yeah, we're both tight
and shit. Our DNA matches.

596
00:51:00,876 --> 00:51:03,577
- What is this place?
- Well, in a few months,

597
00:51:03,578 --> 00:51:06,247
it'll be Club Med
for the homeless, but right now...

598
00:51:06,248 --> 00:51:09,450
just an old furniture spot
I used to work at last summer.

599
00:51:09,451 --> 00:51:14,782
Hop, step, back. Okay?
Real simple, do it with me, right?

600
00:51:17,292 --> 00:51:21,696
Try it one more time. Add on the
next part after that, all right?

601
00:51:21,697 --> 00:51:23,597
Six, seven, eight.

602
00:51:23,598 --> 00:51:28,836
Step, back, break, spin,
out, up, step.

603
00:51:28,837 --> 00:51:30,671
Chilly on that?
One more time.

604
00:51:30,672 --> 00:51:33,140
Okay, on this part?
It's like we're battling, right?

605
00:51:33,141 --> 00:51:35,242
It's like a challenge.
When I step forward like this,

606
00:51:35,243 --> 00:51:37,611
you have to challenge me
back into my space,

607
00:51:37,612 --> 00:51:39,714
and I challenge you back
in your space, like this.

608
00:51:39,715 --> 00:51:42,750
So, it's back, front,
back, front,

609
00:51:42,751 --> 00:51:45,215
back, front,
like that, that kinda feel.

610
00:51:48,323 --> 00:51:51,924
Step, back, forth, back.

611
00:51:59,301 --> 00:52:03,371
Wait, wait. You're making
me dizzy. Stop, stop.

612
00:52:03,372 --> 00:52:06,440
Sit on it, sit on it.
Stick your ass out.

613
00:52:06,441 --> 00:52:08,836
Do it.

614
00:52:21,556 --> 00:52:25,893
Okay, okay. How am I doing?
How's my butt?

615
00:52:25,894 --> 00:52:30,765
It's nice. I mean, it's good.

616
00:52:30,766 --> 00:52:32,763
Thank you.

617
00:52:39,574 --> 00:52:41,709
You made that? It's really nice.

618
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:43,577
It's Tanisha's.

619
00:52:43,578 --> 00:52:46,303
That girl's gonna pay my way
through design school.

620
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:50,985
What about your mom?

621
00:52:50,986 --> 00:52:53,521
Where is she?

622
00:52:53,522 --> 00:52:57,391
She was in jail...
for drugs.

623
00:52:57,392 --> 00:53:00,928
For things women do for drugs.

624
00:53:00,929 --> 00:53:03,697
She got out and took off.

625
00:53:03,698 --> 00:53:07,231
Well, maybe she'll come back.

626
00:53:08,937 --> 00:53:14,175
That is what Derek used to say
when we were little,

627
00:53:14,176 --> 00:53:16,640
when Momma Dean used to
piss us off.

628
00:53:18,346 --> 00:53:22,482
But he grew up.
He grew out of it.

629
00:53:26,121 --> 00:53:28,122
You like Derek, don't you?

630
00:53:28,123 --> 00:53:31,417
No. No.

631
00:53:35,864 --> 00:53:38,299
Wooo! Yeah! I got it!

632
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:41,635
Yo! What's the deal?
What's going on in there?

633
00:53:41,636 --> 00:53:44,738
Wh-What's going on?

634
00:53:44,739 --> 00:53:47,141
Dr. Reynolds in the house.
You know what I'm saying?

635
00:53:47,142 --> 00:53:49,910
- What? What?
- Check it out. Check it out.

636
00:53:49,911 --> 00:53:54,275
Georgetown! It's Georgetown!

637
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:04,391
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

638
00:54:04,392 --> 00:54:06,660
- Really exciting.
- Thank you.

639
00:54:06,661 --> 00:54:11,499
Whoo! Gimme some love.
Give it up.

640
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,667
Are you going to
tell me where we're going?

641
00:54:13,668 --> 00:54:16,070
- No.
- Why is this a surprise for me?

642
00:54:16,071 --> 00:54:18,072
You're the one
with something to celebrate.

643
00:54:18,073 --> 00:54:21,208
- We can celebrate together.
- Okay.

644
00:54:34,189 --> 00:54:37,483
We have an audience.

645
00:54:39,761 --> 00:54:42,623
Work with me.

646
00:55:16,031 --> 00:55:18,722
My God.

647
00:55:35,951 --> 00:55:38,185
That lady was freaking out.

648
00:55:38,186 --> 00:55:41,048
- I know it.
- She was really losing it.

649
00:55:43,858 --> 00:55:46,160
- I'm so excited for you.
- Thank you.

650
00:55:46,161 --> 00:55:48,696
- Are you nervous about Georgetown?
- No.

651
00:55:48,697 --> 00:55:51,627
- Yeah.
- Yes.

652
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,869
I'm sorry.
I-l can't go in there.

653
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:07,338
What do you mean? This is where
I'm taking you, the ballet.

654
00:56:07,339 --> 00:56:09,340
I know, but...

655
00:56:09,341 --> 00:56:11,634
But what?

656
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:19,117
Nothing.

657
00:56:19,118 --> 00:56:22,515
- Nothing. Never mind.
- Come on.

658
00:58:14,299 --> 00:58:16,968
I thought you would like it.

659
00:58:16,969 --> 00:58:20,036
- I did.
- You ain't acting like it.

660
00:58:20,906 --> 00:58:22,907
I'm sorry.

661
00:58:22,908 --> 00:58:26,310
I don't want you to think that I
didn't have a good time. I did.

662
00:58:26,311 --> 00:58:28,679
It's just...

663
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:31,749
ballet is not a part
of my life anymore.

664
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:34,619
I don't understand.
What happened?

665
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:38,122
You just woke up one morning
and decided to waste your talent?

666
00:58:38,123 --> 00:58:41,893
How do you know I have talent?
'Cause you saw me do some leg trick?

667
00:58:41,894 --> 00:58:44,228
I saw the look on your face
when you did it.

668
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:46,230
The same as I saw tonight...

669
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:48,566
Goofy, happy.

670
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:51,202
So, if you're gonna tell me
something about not dancing,

671
00:58:51,203 --> 00:58:53,871
at least tell me something real.

672
00:58:53,872 --> 00:58:56,302
Well, what if
I don't want it to be real?

673
00:58:58,310 --> 00:59:01,379
What I want is to wake up
and see my mom again;

674
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:04,081
for things to go back to the way
when my life made sense.

675
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:06,184
But that's not gonna happen,
and it's all my fault.

676
00:59:06,185 --> 00:59:08,119
- All of it.
- What's your fault?

677
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:11,889
My mom, the accident,
the fact that she's dead.

678
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:14,358
She got scraped off
some highway because of me...

679
00:59:14,359 --> 00:59:17,028
because of my stupid audition.

680
00:59:17,029 --> 00:59:21,966
Because she was rushing because
I made her promise to come.

681
00:59:21,967 --> 00:59:26,170
And when they called my name,
I was mad at her because...

682
00:59:26,171 --> 00:59:29,640
Because I needed her
to be there and she wasn't.

683
00:59:29,641 --> 00:59:33,444
She was dying while I was dancing,
and I was mad at her.

684
00:59:33,445 --> 00:59:36,948
And I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

685
00:59:36,949 --> 00:59:39,417
- I'm so sorry.
- Listen.

686
00:59:39,418 --> 00:59:42,386
It is not your fault
that she died...

687
00:59:42,387 --> 00:59:44,388
or that she was rushing.

688
00:59:44,389 --> 00:59:47,158
She cared about you.
She just wanted to be there for you.

689
00:59:47,159 --> 00:59:51,529
That's what makes it so bad. She
always wanted what was right for me.

690
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:54,131
I wanted to be the prima ballerina.
I had to be.

691
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:58,236
And I didn't care if it took all of
her money and all of her spare time.

692
00:59:58,237 --> 01:00:03,207
It was my stupid audition and my
stupid dream, and it killed her.

693
01:00:03,208 --> 01:00:06,310
And all she wanted
was for it to come true.

694
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:08,312
I bet she would still want it
to come true.

695
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:10,314
She wouldn't want you
to give that up.

696
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:14,975
I know. I just... I don't think that
I can do it without her.

697
01:00:19,458 --> 01:00:21,592
What do you want?

698
01:00:22,794 --> 01:00:24,795
Do you wanna do it, Sara?

699
01:00:24,796 --> 01:00:28,432
I mean you.

700
01:00:28,433 --> 01:00:30,567
Do you want Juilliard?

701
01:00:32,571 --> 01:00:35,506
- Yes.
- All right.

702
01:00:35,507 --> 01:00:37,775
Then, it's on you.

703
01:00:37,776 --> 01:00:41,612
You're the one that's gonna
have to make it happen.

704
01:00:41,613 --> 01:00:46,011
You're the one that's gonna have to
make the dream come true.

705
01:01:27,693 --> 01:01:29,727
So, I'll see you tomorrow?

706
01:01:29,728 --> 01:01:31,996
Yeah.

707
01:01:31,997 --> 01:01:35,724
I promise not to have
a nervous breakdown.

708
01:02:15,307 --> 01:02:17,907
Good night.

709
01:02:18,910 --> 01:02:21,044
Good night.

710
01:04:00,355 --> 01:04:02,790
I called Juilliard
for an application.

711
01:04:02,791 --> 01:04:04,925
They're holding auditions
in Chicago next month.

712
01:04:04,926 --> 01:04:06,927
Next month. That's cool.

713
01:04:06,928 --> 01:04:08,929
I'm out of shape, and it hurts.

714
01:04:08,930 --> 01:04:11,699
If that's what you call
out of shape,

715
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:13,701
what does it take
to get you in shape?

716
01:04:13,702 --> 01:04:16,837
- Practice.
- Okay, jog around the room, then.

717
01:04:16,838 --> 01:04:19,440
Do some push-ups.
I'll sit here, and I'm gonna watch.

718
01:04:19,441 --> 01:04:21,575
That's not how I get into shape.

719
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:28,816
That's it.
Now shoulders down.

720
01:04:28,817 --> 01:04:31,552
Andbring the hip down asyougo.

721
01:04:31,553 --> 01:04:34,922
And stretch through the toes.

722
01:04:34,923 --> 01:04:37,921
Don't wait.

723
01:04:39,628 --> 01:04:42,396
And fiinish.

724
01:04:42,397 --> 01:04:44,398
Good.

725
01:04:44,399 --> 01:04:46,901
You know,
I'm okay with the ballet part,

726
01:04:46,902 --> 01:04:49,036
but I need help
with my free form.

727
01:05:47,229 --> 01:05:49,763
Girl, who is Snookie talking to?

728
01:05:49,764 --> 01:05:52,558
I don't know.
Anything with legs.

729
01:05:55,070 --> 01:05:58,539
I think someone got spilled on.
Hey, back off.

730
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:00,541
Ain't nobody watchin' you
but me.

731
01:06:00,542 --> 01:06:03,244
Yeah, right, nobody's watching.

732
01:06:03,245 --> 01:06:05,379
Come on. Gotta get ready
for Juilliard.

733
01:07:15,450 --> 01:07:19,746
Go Derek! Go Derek! Go Derek!

734
01:07:29,798 --> 01:07:32,330
Go, go, go, girl!

735
01:07:39,341 --> 01:07:42,339
Watch me squash this shit.

736
01:09:48,670 --> 01:09:50,671
You never look as good
as she does with him.

737
01:09:50,672 --> 01:09:53,741
That's oil. You're milk.

738
01:09:53,742 --> 01:09:57,139
Ain't no point trying to mix.

739
01:10:31,863 --> 01:10:35,266
Hey, what's up?

740
01:10:35,267 --> 01:10:37,168
Look, we were just dancing.

741
01:10:37,169 --> 01:10:39,470
And what, her ass just happened
to fall into your hands?

742
01:10:39,471 --> 01:10:43,808
No, it was... You were dancing with
Snookie, I was dancing with Nikki.

743
01:10:43,809 --> 01:10:45,943
The music was going and...

744
01:10:48,146 --> 01:10:50,246
I thought we were
having a good time.

745
01:10:52,050 --> 01:10:56,120
Look. There's nothing
between me and Nikki anymore.

746
01:10:56,121 --> 01:10:58,255
I didn't mean to hurt you.

747
01:11:00,158 --> 01:11:05,196
Sara, I would never do
anything to hurt you.

748
01:11:05,197 --> 01:11:07,331
I'm sorry.

749
01:11:08,934 --> 01:11:12,535
I really am sorry.

750
01:11:17,743 --> 01:11:21,312
- You wanna go?
- Yeah.

751
01:11:21,313 --> 01:11:23,708
Come on. Let's go.

752
01:11:31,490 --> 01:11:33,557
This is it.
This is where I live.

753
01:11:33,558 --> 01:11:35,926
This is my dad's music room.

754
01:11:35,927 --> 01:11:38,462
- He plays the trumpet.
- No shit.

755
01:11:38,463 --> 01:11:42,333
He's actually
pretty good if you like jazz.

756
01:11:42,334 --> 01:11:44,335
No.

757
01:11:44,336 --> 01:11:46,697
He's got some nice stereo equipment.
It's off the hook.

758
01:11:56,047 --> 01:11:58,048
And this is our living room.

759
01:11:58,049 --> 01:12:01,946
- It's not anything special.
- It's all right.

760
01:12:06,591 --> 01:12:09,658
My dad's gonna fiix that.
It's kind of messy in there.

761
01:12:12,264 --> 01:12:14,265
- Do you wanna see my room?
- Yeah.

762
01:12:14,266 --> 01:12:17,601
This is it. I sleep on the couch.

763
01:12:17,602 --> 01:12:20,037
There's a bed underneath,
but it gets stuck,

764
01:12:20,038 --> 01:12:23,774
and my dad says he's gonna
fiix it, but I don't know.

765
01:12:23,775 --> 01:12:27,144
He's, um, at work right now.

766
01:12:27,145 --> 01:12:30,178
He'll... be gone
all night.

767
01:12:34,953 --> 01:12:37,246
Yeah, um...

768
01:13:26,538 --> 01:13:30,374
I'd sleep in a dresser too
if I had six brothers to sleep with.

769
01:13:30,375 --> 01:13:32,376
Hey, fellas, what's up?

770
01:13:32,377 --> 01:13:34,378
- Look at this stud.
- What's up, man?

771
01:13:34,379 --> 01:13:36,313
Hey, playah.
How you doin', man?

772
01:13:36,314 --> 01:13:38,883
Whass up, baby?

773
01:13:38,884 --> 01:13:42,286
No love. No love.

774
01:13:42,287 --> 01:13:46,190
I hear you been traveling in
new circles. What's up with that?

775
01:13:46,191 --> 01:13:48,659
You tappin' that white girl?

776
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:52,496
That's why you ain't got more time
for your boys? Too busy fronting?

777
01:13:52,497 --> 01:13:57,568
Too busy snow flaking. if that's the
case, you best be watching your back.

778
01:13:57,569 --> 01:14:01,071
'Cause white women
don't bring nothin' but trouble.

779
01:14:01,072 --> 01:14:02,973
That ain't white women, man.
That's women.

780
01:14:02,974 --> 01:14:05,376
- That's your women.
- Yo, are we gonna check out...

781
01:14:05,377 --> 01:14:07,144
some honeys on the westside?

782
01:14:07,145 --> 01:14:09,580
- You riding?
- Hell, no.

783
01:14:09,581 --> 01:14:12,816
This ain't about no honeys.
I know what it's about.

784
01:14:12,817 --> 01:14:17,187
Those fools we stomped at Stepps
hit my corner four strong last week.

785
01:14:17,188 --> 01:14:19,690
- I gotta handle myself.
- You slide out that side oftown,

786
01:14:19,691 --> 01:14:24,528
- they gonna handle you.
- They can bring it. I got my heat.

787
01:14:24,529 --> 01:14:26,997
All that gat's gonna do is create
some unnecessary mayhem, man.

788
01:14:26,998 --> 01:14:28,999
That's the black man's life...

789
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,235
- Madness and mayhem.
- How do you know?

790
01:14:31,236 --> 01:14:33,570
You just got out of juvee,
and now you're talking about...

791
01:14:33,571 --> 01:14:35,673
going out there trying to
start some more shit?

792
01:14:35,674 --> 01:14:39,343
That shit ain't funny.

793
01:14:39,344 --> 01:14:42,212
You act like you don't know
who you are anymore, Derek.

794
01:14:42,213 --> 01:14:45,349
And what's up out there
for anybody who ain't you?

795
01:14:45,350 --> 01:14:48,686
I'm still from
this neighborhood, but you?

796
01:14:48,687 --> 01:14:51,422
I guess that's what happens
when a white girl goes to your head.

797
01:14:51,423 --> 01:14:54,224
- Or gives you some.
- Shut up, Lip.

798
01:14:54,225 --> 01:14:55,626
Sorry.

799
01:14:55,627 --> 01:14:58,796
I know what's out there.
Ain't like you can't get past it,

800
01:14:58,797 --> 01:15:00,798
but you're too busy getting
in your own way to see that.

801
01:15:00,799 --> 01:15:04,025
I had some help getting
in my own way, didn't I?

802
01:15:23,054 --> 01:15:25,155
Hey, wassup?

803
01:15:25,156 --> 01:15:27,791
What the hell was that?

804
01:15:27,792 --> 01:15:29,926
I was trying to block the ball.

805
01:15:57,255 --> 01:15:59,821
Stupid bitch!

806
01:16:01,793 --> 01:16:04,962
Good going, Sara!

807
01:16:12,137 --> 01:16:15,636
Get off! That's it!
Nikki, back off!

808
01:16:18,810 --> 01:16:20,644
Yeah!
Yeah!

809
01:16:20,645 --> 01:16:22,813
- Yeah, yeah!
- I like that!

810
01:16:45,170 --> 01:16:48,134
What is this shit?

811
01:16:51,776 --> 01:16:55,207
- Malakai? Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah, man.

812
01:16:57,382 --> 01:16:59,709
Anybody catch one?

813
01:17:13,031 --> 01:17:15,532
It ain't over, bitch.

814
01:17:15,533 --> 01:17:17,667
I don't even know why
it started, bitch.

815
01:17:19,104 --> 01:17:21,105
'Cause you always in my way.

816
01:17:21,106 --> 01:17:25,008
I'm only in your way when it comes
to Derek. That's what this is about.

817
01:17:25,009 --> 01:17:29,646
No, it's about you.
White girls like you.

818
01:17:29,647 --> 01:17:32,849
Creepin' up, takin' our men.

819
01:17:32,850 --> 01:17:36,419
The whole world ain't enough,
you got to conquer ours too.

820
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:39,222
Whatever, Nikki.
Derek and I like each other,

821
01:17:39,223 --> 01:17:41,653
and if you have a problem
with that, screw you.

822
01:17:54,038 --> 01:17:56,172
I'll get it.

823
01:17:58,376 --> 01:18:01,409
Yeah, I'm coming.

824
01:18:04,248 --> 01:18:07,550
- Hi.
- Shit!

825
01:18:07,551 --> 01:18:10,253
- I'm okay.
- Wait. Let me see.

826
01:18:10,254 --> 01:18:12,656
I'm really okay.
I'm fiine.

827
01:18:12,657 --> 01:18:14,882
Well, what did she do?

828
01:18:16,327 --> 01:18:19,362
Um, now is really not
a good time to talk.

829
01:18:19,363 --> 01:18:22,054
- Okay. Well...
- I'll call you.

830
01:18:25,970 --> 01:18:28,104
No.

831
01:18:32,943 --> 01:18:35,077
Here, let me see.

832
01:18:36,113 --> 01:18:38,114
- Here.
- God, that stinks.

833
01:18:38,115 --> 01:18:41,151
Yeah, but it's gonna keep your face
from swelling up like a pumpkin.

834
01:18:41,152 --> 01:18:45,686
Hold it. Here.
Hold it on there.

835
01:18:54,098 --> 01:18:56,630
So, whatcha gonna do?

836
01:18:59,603 --> 01:19:03,006
It's payback time.
Either you down or you not.

837
01:19:03,007 --> 01:19:05,308
Either you my boy or you ain't.
Simple as that.

838
01:19:05,309 --> 01:19:09,646
Ha! Hey, baby,
we lit it up out there.

839
01:19:09,647 --> 01:19:11,648
I am serious.
Did you see us, "D" man?

840
01:19:11,649 --> 01:19:14,584
Do you see us?
We're talking.

841
01:19:14,585 --> 01:19:18,421
Anyway. Hey, baby,
we lit it up.

842
01:19:18,422 --> 01:19:22,525
- Man, come on, man!
- That shit ain't funny, man.

843
01:19:22,526 --> 01:19:26,162
- You damn right it ain't funny.
- I thought you liked it down there.

844
01:19:26,163 --> 01:19:29,299
That's your specialty, ain't it?
Crawling on the floor like a bitch.

845
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:31,868
That was a reflex action
in the heat of the moment.

846
01:19:31,869 --> 01:19:35,805
You're just plain rude and wrong to
bring that shit up in mixed company.

847
01:19:35,806 --> 01:19:38,875
- I'm gonna go home. Are you ready?
- No, he's not ready.

848
01:19:38,876 --> 01:19:41,878
He's talking to me.
It's an "A" and "B" conversation.

849
01:19:41,879 --> 01:19:44,681
- You gotta go? See yourself home.
- Fuck you!

850
01:19:44,682 --> 01:19:47,680
- Bitch, I'm gonna...
- What the hell is your problem?

851
01:19:51,689 --> 01:19:55,125
You gonna take that bitch's back
and won't even cover mine?

852
01:19:55,126 --> 01:19:58,328
- 'Cause you wrong, Malakai.
- No, you're wrong.

853
01:19:58,329 --> 01:20:02,365
You been wrong.
You ain't even worth shit no more.

854
01:20:02,366 --> 01:20:06,263
Get outta my face, college boy, and
take that trailer trash ho with you.

855
01:20:41,939 --> 01:20:45,041
Honey, his blue pajamas
are at the bottom of the bag.

856
01:20:45,042 --> 01:20:48,111
If it's as cold as it was today,
put those on him.

857
01:20:48,112 --> 01:20:51,014
Hey, whatcha all doing with
my nephew here? Come on now.

858
01:20:51,015 --> 01:20:54,651
There we go.
It's okay. It's okay.

859
01:20:54,652 --> 01:20:57,620
- What's wrong with him?
- He don't know you, Kenny.

860
01:20:57,621 --> 01:21:02,559
I'm his father, he knows me.
What should I do?

861
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:05,195
- Come around more often.
- See, I can't talk to you.

862
01:21:05,196 --> 01:21:08,131
And I can't depend on you.

863
01:21:08,132 --> 01:21:10,467
Shh.

864
01:21:10,468 --> 01:21:14,938
What do you think I use
to raise this baby, oxygen?

865
01:21:14,939 --> 01:21:18,942
He has needs, Kenny,
and his needs require money.

866
01:21:18,943 --> 01:21:22,145
- Here we go.
- And we're gonna keep going...

867
01:21:22,146 --> 01:21:24,380
until I get what I need from you
to raise your son.

868
01:21:24,381 --> 01:21:26,382
I'm doing the best that I can.

869
01:21:26,383 --> 01:21:28,818
But do you think your mouth
helps the situation?

870
01:21:28,819 --> 01:21:32,789
I'm just trying to deal with
this shit. I didn't ask forthis.

871
01:21:32,790 --> 01:21:35,158
What, and I did?

872
01:21:35,159 --> 01:21:37,794
I climbed on top of myself
and got pregnant?

873
01:21:37,795 --> 01:21:40,663
You want me to take him
to my mother's?

874
01:21:40,664 --> 01:21:45,168
I'll take him.
Get his shit ready. Get him ready!

875
01:21:45,169 --> 01:21:49,105
No. You're not going
now here with my son tonight.

876
01:21:49,106 --> 01:21:51,441
Not on that temper,
and not with that attitude.

877
01:21:51,442 --> 01:21:54,410
Look, you know what? Fine. Then,
I won't take him. I'm outta here.

878
01:21:54,411 --> 01:21:58,181
Go ahead, leave.
That's what you're good at!

879
01:21:58,182 --> 01:22:01,180
Your son ain't seen nothing
but your back since he was born!

880
01:22:06,924 --> 01:22:09,359
Shawana Clarke.

881
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,494
Shawana Clarke.

882
01:22:14,698 --> 01:22:16,699
Do you want me to take him?

883
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:18,701
No.

884
01:22:18,702 --> 01:22:20,803
Travis, come here.
Come here, Travis.

885
01:22:20,804 --> 01:22:22,938
Travis, put that down.

886
01:22:25,943 --> 01:22:28,444
Excuse me. I have been here
for an hour and a half.

887
01:22:28,445 --> 01:22:30,813
Am I gonna be able
to see a doctor anytime soon?

888
01:22:30,814 --> 01:22:34,651
I've already told you, we'll
get you in as soon as we can.

889
01:22:34,652 --> 01:22:37,153
My appointment was an hour ago.
I already got here early.

890
01:22:37,154 --> 01:22:39,856
We are doing the best we can.
We have a lot of people.

891
01:22:39,857 --> 01:22:41,991
Is there somebody
else I can talk to?

892
01:22:54,371 --> 01:22:56,406
Wench. I gotta stand over her...

893
01:22:56,407 --> 01:22:58,641
to make sure she puts your name
on the damn list.

894
01:22:58,642 --> 01:23:00,776
Triflin' bitch.

895
01:23:02,212 --> 01:23:07,116
Okay. Ooo-kay.

896
01:23:07,117 --> 01:23:10,853
Yeah. Da da da da
da da da da.

897
01:23:10,854 --> 01:23:13,089
I'll get that.

898
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:15,224
Da da!

899
01:23:17,361 --> 01:23:20,121
I know. I know.
I know. I know.

900
01:23:21,131 --> 01:23:23,900
So, your dad's trippin'
about the fiight.

901
01:23:23,901 --> 01:23:27,670
- Yeah.
- Probably thinks it's Derek's fault.

902
01:23:27,671 --> 01:23:30,540
No, I explained about Nikki.

903
01:23:30,541 --> 01:23:34,700
So, you put it all on her.
None of it's on you.

904
01:23:37,681 --> 01:23:40,917
She started it.
I told you what she said.

905
01:23:40,918 --> 01:23:43,753
Maybe she didn't have no business
getting up in your face,

906
01:23:43,754 --> 01:23:46,222
but she had reason
to say what she said.

907
01:23:46,223 --> 01:23:49,125
Wait a minute.
You agree with her?

908
01:23:49,126 --> 01:23:52,996
You and Derek act like it don't
bother people to see you together.

909
01:23:52,997 --> 01:23:55,231
Like it don't
hurt people to see.

910
01:23:55,232 --> 01:23:58,434
Well, we like each other.

911
01:23:58,435 --> 01:24:03,206
What is the big damn deal? It's me
and him, not us and other people.

912
01:24:03,207 --> 01:24:06,776
Black people, Sara.
Black women.

913
01:24:06,777 --> 01:24:08,911
Derek's about something.

914
01:24:08,912 --> 01:24:11,848
He's smart. He's motivated.
He's for real.

915
01:24:11,849 --> 01:24:14,250
He's not gonna make babies
and not take care of them,

916
01:24:14,251 --> 01:24:16,386
or run the streets
messing up his life.

917
01:24:16,387 --> 01:24:19,022
He's gonna make something
of himself. And here you come...

918
01:24:19,023 --> 01:24:21,324
White, so you gotta be right...
And take one of the few...

919
01:24:21,325 --> 01:24:24,327
decent men we have left
after jail, drugs and drive-by.

920
01:24:24,328 --> 01:24:28,965
That is what Nikki meant
about you up in our world.

921
01:24:28,966 --> 01:24:31,054
There's only one world,
Chenille.

922
01:24:31,055 --> 01:24:34,457
That is what they teach you.
We know different.

923
01:24:34,458 --> 01:24:37,961
L-I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.

924
01:24:37,962 --> 01:24:42,866
You wanna be a friend?
Don't just be here to be here.

925
01:24:42,867 --> 01:24:46,901
Open up your pretty brown eyes
and look the hell around.

926
01:25:12,330 --> 01:25:14,464
Excuse me.

927
01:25:20,971 --> 01:25:24,474
Come on, Sara,
this is for your audition.

928
01:25:24,475 --> 01:25:28,578
Come on. No, no, no.
You're not attacking it.

929
01:25:28,579 --> 01:25:31,214
You're not working it, okay?
Come on now.

930
01:25:31,215 --> 01:25:33,216
I'll get it right the next time.

931
01:25:33,217 --> 01:25:36,119
You don't have time.
You gotta get it right now.

932
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:38,521
- I can't work like this.
- Like what?

933
01:25:38,522 --> 01:25:41,247
Like this, with you
dictating to me.

934
01:25:43,794 --> 01:25:47,122
Allright.
Let's take a break.

935
01:25:51,102 --> 01:25:54,571
I'm sorry. It's just that
the audition's next week,

936
01:25:54,572 --> 01:25:56,706
and everything
is so messed up at school.

937
01:25:56,707 --> 01:25:59,239
I don't know. I'm feeling
a little bit weird.

938
01:26:02,213 --> 01:26:04,447
You know everything's
going to be okay.

939
01:26:04,448 --> 01:26:07,517
I feel it.

940
01:26:07,518 --> 01:26:10,220
So, you pick out a dress yet?

941
01:26:10,221 --> 01:26:12,322
Dress?

942
01:26:12,323 --> 01:26:14,491
Yeah, you know, girls
wear those sometimes.

943
01:26:14,492 --> 01:26:17,727
Stepps.
Main Squeeze Night.

944
01:26:17,728 --> 01:26:20,864
Couples only Saturday night.

945
01:26:20,865 --> 01:26:22,866
We already talked
about this, remember?

946
01:26:22,867 --> 01:26:25,335
Yeah.

947
01:26:25,336 --> 01:26:28,004
We talked about it,
but I didn't know we decided on it.

948
01:26:28,005 --> 01:26:30,366
Well, it's Stepps.
What is there to decide on it?

949
01:26:31,842 --> 01:26:36,179
I don't know. I just thought that
with the fiight and everything...

950
01:26:36,180 --> 01:26:38,815
that maybe we should cool it
for a little while.

951
01:26:38,816 --> 01:26:40,950
What?

952
01:26:44,021 --> 01:26:46,823
Well, what are you saying?

953
01:26:46,824 --> 01:26:49,259
Are you saying that
you don't wanna be with me?

954
01:26:49,260 --> 01:26:51,661
You don't wanna be seen with me?
What are you saying?

955
01:26:51,662 --> 01:26:53,663
I'm just saying
I'm confused, that's all.

956
01:26:53,664 --> 01:26:55,899
Confused about what?
Me?

957
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:58,701
A little bit.

958
01:26:58,702 --> 01:27:02,172
I don't know.
Yeah... no... maybe.

959
01:27:02,173 --> 01:27:04,174
Maybe?

960
01:27:04,175 --> 01:27:07,277
So, hold on. What? Are we talking
about Stepps and school,

961
01:27:07,278 --> 01:27:11,648
or are you talking about the grocery
store, the sidewalk and museums?

962
01:27:11,649 --> 01:27:14,551
Break it down a little bit better
for me, 'cause I don't get it.

963
01:27:14,552 --> 01:27:17,554
When is it okay for us to be
together? To be seen together?

964
01:27:17,555 --> 01:27:19,789
Why are you getting mad?
I'm just being honest.

965
01:27:19,790 --> 01:27:21,958
Nobody wants to see us together.

966
01:27:21,959 --> 01:27:25,028
We spend more time defending
our relationship than having one.

967
01:27:25,029 --> 01:27:27,030
It's just... so hard.

968
01:27:27,031 --> 01:27:30,266
Everything's gotta be easy? That's
the story of your life, not mine.

969
01:27:30,267 --> 01:27:32,202
You know this much
about my life.

970
01:27:32,203 --> 01:27:34,737
I know when shit gets rough,
you give up and punk out.

971
01:27:34,738 --> 01:27:37,207
Just the way you punked out
on ballet when your mom died.

972
01:27:37,208 --> 01:27:41,544
You don't know shit about my mother.
How dare you talk about my mom!

973
01:27:41,545 --> 01:27:43,679
God!

974
01:27:45,015 --> 01:27:47,581
I'm sorry.

975
01:27:48,953 --> 01:27:51,087
I shouldn't have said that.

976
01:27:52,623 --> 01:27:54,324
It's just that...

977
01:27:54,325 --> 01:27:56,925
all this shitjust kind of
caught me off guard.

978
01:27:58,395 --> 01:28:01,928
I mean, it's, like, damn,
you don't wanna be with me.

979
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:05,735
Is that what you're saying,

980
01:28:05,736 --> 01:28:07,737
that you don't
want to be with me?

981
01:28:07,738 --> 01:28:09,739
No, it's not like that.

982
01:28:09,740 --> 01:28:12,075
I'm trying to tell you how I feel,
and you're taking it personal.

983
01:28:12,076 --> 01:28:14,143
Let me tell you something, Sara.

984
01:28:14,144 --> 01:28:17,614
I just hit the best friend I have
in the world in the face overyou.

985
01:28:17,615 --> 01:28:19,883
I've been taking shit
from people I've known all my life.

986
01:28:19,884 --> 01:28:22,785
People I care about, that care
about me so I could be with you.

987
01:28:22,786 --> 01:28:25,121
Telling myselfthat
we are in this together.

988
01:28:25,122 --> 01:28:28,024
So, don't give me this "nothing
personal." I don't wanna hear it.

989
01:28:28,025 --> 01:28:31,394
Fine. if I'm messing up
your life so much,

990
01:28:31,395 --> 01:28:34,223
then maybe we
shouldn't be together.

991
01:28:36,700 --> 01:28:39,801
You know what?
I don't need this shit.

992
01:28:41,171 --> 01:28:43,172
I don't even know why l bother.

993
01:28:43,173 --> 01:28:46,109
I'm out.

994
01:28:46,110 --> 01:28:48,111
The hell with it.

995
01:28:48,112 --> 01:28:50,246
The hell with you.

996
01:29:35,659 --> 01:29:39,195
You know, about the other night.
I don't want there to be...

997
01:29:39,196 --> 01:29:43,025
Don't even worry about it, man.
Myjaw's not made out of glass.

998
01:29:44,301 --> 01:29:47,604
Yeah, well, you know,
blood's thicker than blonds, right?

999
01:29:47,605 --> 01:29:50,171
So, you got my back on Saturday?

1000
01:29:51,542 --> 01:29:55,044
Derek... l ain't got
nobody else, man.

1001
01:29:55,045 --> 01:29:57,080
- You got Lip.
- Lip?

1002
01:29:57,081 --> 01:30:00,249
Man, that fool will get
a nigger killed quick, man.

1003
01:30:00,250 --> 01:30:04,554
No, I need you there.

1004
01:30:04,555 --> 01:30:06,756
47th Street, under the El.

1005
01:30:06,757 --> 01:30:09,425
I'll call you, man.

1006
01:30:09,426 --> 01:30:11,526
Are you down?

1007
01:30:12,730 --> 01:30:14,864
- Yeah, I'm down.
- All right, man.

1008
01:30:16,433 --> 01:30:18,968
Let me get to class,
get some education like you.

1009
01:30:18,969 --> 01:30:21,103
All right.

1010
01:31:12,623 --> 01:31:17,624
I don't wanna bug you. I just
came in here to say good luck.

1011
01:31:19,430 --> 01:31:21,431
So, tomorrow's the big day,

1012
01:31:21,432 --> 01:31:24,267
Yeah.

1013
01:31:24,268 --> 01:31:28,336
- You scared?
- Shitless.

1014
01:31:30,641 --> 01:31:34,781
You got a minute for your old man?
I wanna show you something.

1015
01:31:34,782 --> 01:31:36,711
Sure.

1016
01:31:56,804 --> 01:32:00,507
Be careful.
That wall, it's,

1017
01:32:00,508 --> 01:32:02,642
still wet.

1018
01:32:19,827 --> 01:32:22,328
That'syourmother
when she was 19,

1019
01:32:22,329 --> 01:32:24,964
when I fiirst met her.

1020
01:32:24,965 --> 01:32:27,801
I know.

1021
01:32:27,802 --> 01:32:32,005
It's just a start. I mean, I know
you're too old for a twin bed.

1022
01:32:32,006 --> 01:32:35,767
It's a nice bed, Roy.

1023
01:32:39,013 --> 01:32:42,205
You know, I-l didn't mean
to mess up your life.

1024
01:32:43,717 --> 01:32:45,851
Oryour mother's.

1025
01:32:47,288 --> 01:32:52,459
And I don't deserve a second chance
to be your father,

1026
01:32:52,460 --> 01:32:55,356
but I'm hoping
you'll give me one anyway.

1027
01:32:57,031 --> 01:32:59,290
You know, wayback when...

1028
01:33:01,368 --> 01:33:04,737
l thought l had all the time
in the world to get to know you,

1029
01:33:04,738 --> 01:33:07,236
for you to get to know me.

1030
01:33:08,976 --> 01:33:12,645
But... one day...

1031
01:33:12,646 --> 01:33:14,871
wake up, you look around.

1032
01:33:16,183 --> 01:33:19,886
All you got to show
for yourself is a...

1033
01:33:19,887 --> 01:33:22,851
beautiful, talented,
little girl.

1034
01:33:24,125 --> 01:33:26,259
Young woman...

1035
01:33:27,394 --> 01:33:29,395
who hates you.

1036
01:33:29,396 --> 01:33:31,757
I don't hate you.

1037
01:33:33,434 --> 01:33:35,568
I miss her.

1038
01:33:44,044 --> 01:33:47,213
I miss her so much.

1039
01:33:55,723 --> 01:33:58,949
God, everything is so screwed up.

1040
01:34:00,761 --> 01:34:03,229
Derek is mad at me.

1041
01:34:03,230 --> 01:34:05,455
He's not gonna come tomorrow.

1042
01:34:06,967 --> 01:34:09,101
I want him to be there.

1043
01:34:10,037 --> 01:34:12,330
Ineedhim to be there.

1044
01:34:14,808 --> 01:34:18,102
I just want someone there
who loves me.

1045
01:34:20,581 --> 01:34:23,079
I love you.

1046
01:34:37,298 --> 01:34:40,331
Hey.

1047
01:34:47,675 --> 01:34:50,510
Why are you so quiet?

1048
01:34:50,511 --> 01:34:52,512
I don't feel like talking.

1049
01:34:52,513 --> 01:34:55,281
Derek, there's something
I oughta tell you.

1050
01:34:55,282 --> 01:34:58,484
I said something to Sara.

1051
01:34:58,485 --> 01:35:01,354
What?
What did you say?

1052
01:35:01,355 --> 01:35:04,190
Stuff.

1053
01:35:04,191 --> 01:35:08,061
About how maybe Nikki had a point
about black men and white women.

1054
01:35:08,062 --> 01:35:10,463
What?
You said what?

1055
01:35:10,464 --> 01:35:14,367
I'm sorry.
I-l don't even like Nikki.

1056
01:35:14,368 --> 01:35:16,502
I was trippin' off Kenny.

1057
01:35:17,905 --> 01:35:22,575
You can't help who you love, Derek.
You're not supposed to.

1058
01:35:22,576 --> 01:35:25,678
When you love somebody,
you love them.

1059
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:28,715
Look at me.

1060
01:35:28,716 --> 01:35:32,151
At least you found somebody
who loves you back.

1061
01:35:32,152 --> 01:35:34,354
I gotta go.

1062
01:35:34,355 --> 01:35:36,689
Where you going?

1063
01:35:36,690 --> 01:35:40,026
Stay out of my business,
Chenille.

1064
01:35:40,027 --> 01:35:43,229
I know what Malakai
wants you to do.

1065
01:35:43,230 --> 01:35:45,231
Why are you trippin'
off him, Derek?

1066
01:35:45,232 --> 01:35:47,734
All you're trying to do
is get the hell up out of here.

1067
01:35:47,735 --> 01:35:50,069
Ain't no shame or blame in that.

1068
01:35:50,070 --> 01:35:53,637
It's getting cold out here.
Take that baby inside.

1069
01:36:19,733 --> 01:36:21,868
Hey.

1070
01:36:21,869 --> 01:36:24,003
Hey.

1071
01:36:36,617 --> 01:36:39,285
Kai, I've been trying
to catch up with you.

1072
01:36:40,354 --> 01:36:42,355
I gotta talk to you.

1073
01:36:42,356 --> 01:36:44,490
- Ready to roll?
- I gotta talk to you.

1074
01:36:45,993 --> 01:36:48,294
- Wassup?
- Look, man. I ain't going with you.

1075
01:36:48,295 --> 01:36:50,563
What you mean you're not going?

1076
01:36:50,564 --> 01:36:53,733
- You know what I mean.
- Did you come here to waste my time?

1077
01:36:53,734 --> 01:36:57,704
This shit is nonsense, Kai.
It's dangerous nonsense.

1078
01:36:57,705 --> 01:37:01,507
Just back up off it, man. Come on.
I'll go with you if you go home.

1079
01:37:01,508 --> 01:37:05,345
Go home? Get the hell away from me,
you punk-ass bitch.

1080
01:37:05,346 --> 01:37:08,915
You're the one don't have the balls.
To walk away from this shit.

1081
01:37:08,916 --> 01:37:11,951
I should have tookyour ass
tojail along with mine, man.

1082
01:37:11,952 --> 01:37:14,654
But you didn't, so you do not
have to get in that car.

1083
01:37:14,655 --> 01:37:19,125
Malakai, you are so much
smarter than this shit.

1084
01:37:19,126 --> 01:37:22,495
I know what you can be.
I know what you're capable of.

1085
01:37:22,496 --> 01:37:24,497
Let's just walk away.

1086
01:37:24,498 --> 01:37:27,367
Walk away to what?
I'm not you, Derek.

1087
01:37:27,368 --> 01:37:29,502
I can't do nothing
but what I'm doing.

1088
01:37:29,503 --> 01:37:31,971
I can't go to Georgetown
with a 10.0 G.P.A.,

1089
01:37:31,972 --> 01:37:34,340
operating on people,
doing brain surgery...

1090
01:37:34,341 --> 01:37:36,743
- or whateveryou're gonna be doing.
- You can, man.

1091
01:37:36,744 --> 01:37:39,946
- If I can do it, you can do it.
- All I have is my respect.

1092
01:37:39,947 --> 01:37:42,882
Andthat's what lgotta
go take care of.

1093
01:37:42,883 --> 01:37:45,885
You wanna bail out
on me, man? That's fiine.

1094
01:37:45,886 --> 01:37:49,489
But you can kiss my ass
with all your future bullshit.

1095
01:37:49,490 --> 01:37:53,251
I know who the hell I am...
right now.

1096
01:37:54,795 --> 01:37:57,156
Kai, man, wait, man.

1097
01:37:59,967 --> 01:38:02,101
Let's go, man.

1098
01:38:26,851 --> 01:38:28,848
Sara?

1099
01:38:32,757 --> 01:38:34,691
Ready to go?

1100
01:38:34,692 --> 01:38:36,883
Um...

1101
01:38:39,263 --> 01:38:41,397
Yes. Yes.

1102
01:38:57,215 --> 01:38:59,280
Sara!

1103
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:05,188
Sara Johnson?

1104
01:41:03,774 --> 01:41:05,908
Aah!

1105
01:41:33,504 --> 01:41:36,339
Miss Johnson, we meet again.

1106
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:39,042
I assume you prepared
a contemporary piece.

1107
01:41:39,043 --> 01:41:42,644
Yes, sir. They have my music.

1108
01:42:09,006 --> 01:42:11,741
Hold it. Hold it. Cut the music.

1109
01:42:11,742 --> 01:42:14,308
I'm sorry, sir.
I wasn't ready.

1110
01:42:16,580 --> 01:42:19,476
Are you ready now?

1111
01:42:29,260 --> 01:42:31,360
Yes, sir, she's ready!

1112
01:42:33,731 --> 01:42:36,832
Young man, excuse me.
This is an audition.

1113
01:42:38,135 --> 01:42:41,104
Who let him in here?

1114
01:42:41,105 --> 01:42:44,001
How did he get in here?
He's not supposed to be there.

1115
01:42:45,743 --> 01:42:47,744
- Youngman!
- You can do this.

1116
01:42:47,745 --> 01:42:50,980
- I messed up. It's too late.
- It is not too late.

1117
01:42:50,981 --> 01:42:54,217
- Miss Johnson.
- You can do it.

1118
01:42:54,218 --> 01:42:57,487
Sara, you were born to do it.

1119
01:42:57,488 --> 01:43:01,920
- Thatjudge hates me.
- Forget him.

1120
01:43:03,294 --> 01:43:05,962
Ain't nobody watching you
but me.

1121
01:43:05,963 --> 01:43:08,097
All right?

1122
01:43:10,501 --> 01:43:13,397
Now show me some attitude.

1123
01:43:15,439 --> 01:43:17,573
Miss Johnson,
we don't have time for this.

1124
01:43:19,176 --> 01:43:21,344
Areyou ready to continue?

1125
01:43:21,345 --> 01:43:24,378
- Miss Johnson!
- I'm ready.

1126
01:46:09,065 --> 01:46:13,101
Whoo! Yeah! That's what
I'm talkin' about, baby.

1127
01:46:13,102 --> 01:46:15,930
Look, all due respect, if you don't
let this girl in, you're crazy.

1128
01:46:18,641 --> 01:46:21,243
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much.

1129
01:46:21,244 --> 01:46:24,079
Miss Johnson,

1130
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:27,149
I can't say this
on the record yet,

1131
01:46:27,150 --> 01:46:29,284
but welcome toJuilliard.

1132
01:46:42,131 --> 01:46:46,427
Thank you. Thank you.

Yeah, hype it up.
Hype it up, everybody.

1134
01:47:11,627 --> 01:47:15,063
Hey, I heard
you got into Juilliard.

1135
01:47:15,064 --> 01:47:18,200
That's like the hottest school
on the planet, right?

1136
01:47:18,201 --> 01:47:20,469
Yeah, it's pretty good.

1137
01:47:20,470 --> 01:47:23,772
Well, I know they got all these
famous dance teachers and shit,

1138
01:47:23,773 --> 01:47:28,677
but if you need some new moves,
you know, some real flavor,

1139
01:47:28,678 --> 01:47:31,046
you know who to call.

1140
01:47:31,047 --> 01:47:33,048
All right?

1141
01:47:33,049 --> 01:47:35,684
All right.

1142
01:47:35,685 --> 01:47:39,013
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

1143
01:47:40,156 --> 01:47:42,691
Hold it. Hold it.
Hold it. Hold it.

1144
01:47:42,692 --> 01:47:46,695
- Say, "Thank you, Snookie."
- Thank you, Snookie.

1145
01:47:46,696 --> 01:47:50,087
Get your ass on the floor.
