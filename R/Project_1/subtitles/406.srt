1
00:01:59,575 --> 00:02:01,827
He stole the chip, he's inside.

2
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:04,830
I see him.

3
00:02:28,146 --> 00:02:29,647
Kirill!

4
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,318
Time to work.

5
00:03:48,482 --> 00:03:51,986
NSA Remote Intelligence
Facility Mt. Weather, Virginia.

6
00:04:11,882 --> 00:04:17,804
At 0030 hours, the mission
deviated from the set parameters.

7
00:04:18,013 --> 00:04:21,808
It wasn't part of the plan for our
agent to get shot in the back.

8
00:04:27,106 --> 00:04:28,608
Identity confirmed.

9
00:04:28,858 --> 00:04:32,278
McGrath was uploading some
data to us when he was killed.

10
00:04:32,487 --> 00:04:35,740
Take a look at this. I'm not
sure yet exactly what it is.

11
00:04:38,701 --> 00:04:42,371
- A fragment of a complex
molecule. - Gibbons.

12
00:04:42,663 --> 00:04:45,792
We think it's a link to
a Soviet bio-weapon...

13
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:47,668
called Silent Night.

14
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,963
- James, what the hell is he
doing here? - I called him in.

15
00:04:51,214 --> 00:04:54,008
We've lost three agents already.
You could use the help.

16
00:04:54,258 --> 00:04:57,470
I found out your agents were
killed by this group, Anarchy 99.

17
00:04:57,637 --> 00:05:02,100
They're ex-military. They can smell the
training on our agents a mile away.

18
00:05:02,267 --> 00:05:06,271
Sir, I think it's time
we tried something new.

19
00:05:15,197 --> 00:05:18,075
These guys aren't ours.
Who are they? CIA?

20
00:05:18,283 --> 00:05:22,538
No, civilians. Convicts,
mercs, contract killers.

21
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:24,958
The best and brightest of
the bottom of the barrel.

22
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:29,504
- They're the scum of the earth. -
Programmable, expendable, effective.

23
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:32,423
I think it's our best shot.

24
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:35,760
Do we want to drop another
mouse in the snake pit?

25
00:05:35,927 --> 00:05:39,305
Or send our own snake
and let him crawl in?

26
00:05:43,144 --> 00:05:46,313
Sacramento, California.

27
00:05:50,151 --> 00:05:52,903
Come on, Pepe. This
is unbelievable.

28
00:05:53,612 --> 00:05:55,281
Hello!

29
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:58,159
Well, it's about time.
Now, listen...

30
00:05:58,367 --> 00:06:01,537
Were you coming from Tijuana?
I don't mean to be rude.

31
00:06:01,746 --> 00:06:04,541
Keep it out of the sun. I
don't want the paint to fade.

32
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:08,253
Do you understand English? I
pay enough for you people.

33
00:06:12,424 --> 00:06:15,760
Come on, Janelle. You're
gonna love this place.

34
00:06:16,511 --> 00:06:19,347
- Dick, how are you?
- This is Janelle.

35
00:06:28,608 --> 00:06:30,234
- Call 911.
- Who's driving my car?

36
00:06:36,158 --> 00:06:39,036
Senator Hotchkiss!
California State Senate!

37
00:06:39,245 --> 00:06:41,539
Listen, somebody
just stole my car!

38
00:07:07,108 --> 00:07:09,985
You, in the red Corvette!
Pull over immediately!

39
00:07:10,111 --> 00:07:14,657
Yeah, yeah. These monkeys are
following me because I took this car.

40
00:07:14,907 --> 00:07:17,743
Obviously the car doesn't belong
to me, it's not my style.

41
00:07:17,911 --> 00:07:23,208
It belongs to Dick, Dick Hotchkiss,
a California state senator.

42
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:26,336
You remember Dick. He
tried to ban rap music...

43
00:07:26,545 --> 00:07:29,589
because he feels the
lyrics promote violence.

44
00:07:29,756 --> 00:07:31,133
It's music, Dick!

45
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:35,971
He also wants to pull every video game
off every shelf in the country...

46
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:41,936
because he feels that the video games
diminish the intelligence of our youth.

47
00:07:42,103 --> 00:07:44,105
Come on, Dick.

48
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:47,108
It's the only education we got.

49
00:07:49,485 --> 00:07:52,697
You're a bad man. You know
what we do to bad men.

50
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,407
We punish them.

51
00:07:54,616 --> 00:08:00,497
Dick, you've just entered
the Xander zone.

52
00:08:00,998 --> 00:08:04,126
I'm coming in hot
with a side of bacon!

53
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:14,679
Go, go, go!

54
00:08:35,534 --> 00:08:36,619
Pull it! Pull it!

55
00:08:57,265 --> 00:08:58,934
Yes!

56
00:09:24,377 --> 00:09:26,337
Go get the cameras! Go! Go! Go!

57
00:09:31,301 --> 00:09:34,012
Moral is, don't be a dick, Dick!

58
00:09:40,145 --> 00:09:44,524
You guys got the cameras? All
right, let's go, let's go!

59
00:09:50,573 --> 00:09:51,907
Peace out!

60
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,442
Outstanding.

61
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,445
Thank you.

62
00:10:29,946 --> 00:10:32,157
- What's up?
- You invited these people?

63
00:10:32,282 --> 00:10:33,575
Of course not.

64
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:40,290
That's my dog! What's up?

65
00:10:40,499 --> 00:10:43,335
Today was off the hook!
You're psycho, bro!

66
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:46,338
Psycho? That was off
the chain, man!

67
00:10:46,547 --> 00:10:51,719
Yo, yo, yo! What's up with that crazy
trick that we've been hearing about?

68
00:10:51,845 --> 00:10:55,182
- My Superman seat-grab
barrel roll? - Word.

69
00:10:55,349 --> 00:10:57,810
I'm still working on it.

70
00:10:59,645 --> 00:11:01,647
You're a hard guy
to get ahold of.

71
00:11:02,231 --> 00:11:06,276
You know, an athlete like you should
really have his own video game.

72
00:11:06,486 --> 00:11:10,073
Jordan King. I can
make it happen.

73
00:11:10,698 --> 00:11:13,868
- I'll hold on to this for
later. - You do that.

74
00:11:19,332 --> 00:11:22,460
You know he'll never sell out.
That's why he is who he is.

75
00:11:22,669 --> 00:11:25,338
So you need to relax. Who
invited you, anyway?

76
00:11:25,506 --> 00:11:27,341
Shut up.

77
00:11:32,304 --> 00:11:36,142
Listen, this is for real. I can get
us an advance on Internet pre-sales.

78
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:39,145
So you need to just go to
Pago Pago or something.

79
00:11:39,478 --> 00:11:42,481
Get some girls, do them all. I
don't care. Go on vacation.

80
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:46,319
It's Bora Bora, J. I
got enough girls here.

81
00:11:46,486 --> 00:11:49,322
Since when did you care
so much about money?

82
00:11:49,489 --> 00:11:52,492
I just need you to lay low
till the heat's off, okay?

83
00:11:52,784 --> 00:11:57,664
I run a secret website. I got tapes to
make and I can't do that with you in jail.

84
00:11:57,873 --> 00:12:01,042
- Did you see that?
- I don't care. Listen to me.

85
00:12:01,836 --> 00:12:02,879
I'm untouchable.

86
00:12:12,638 --> 00:12:14,807
Let's go! Get out! Move!

87
00:12:15,057 --> 00:12:16,851
Okay, I'll turn down the music.

88
00:12:24,568 --> 00:12:26,945
It was only a Corvette.

89
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,369
Let's go, baby. Your
order is getting cold.

90
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:43,046
- Want coffee? - Can you
give me some hash browns?

91
00:12:43,172 --> 00:12:46,842
- Sure. - Make them sloppy.
I like them runny.

92
00:12:47,718 --> 00:12:48,928
How did I get here?

93
00:12:49,386 --> 00:12:53,891
Two big guys dropped you off 10 minutes
ago. Told me to look after you.

94
00:12:54,016 --> 00:12:56,685
You look like you could
use some coffee.

95
00:13:12,744 --> 00:13:14,412
You all right?

96
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:16,039
Fine.

97
00:13:30,763 --> 00:13:34,142
I said, you got a problem, boy?

98
00:13:34,642 --> 00:13:35,893
No. No problem.

99
00:13:36,978 --> 00:13:39,272
- Nobody make a move!
- Nobody move!

100
00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:43,861
Just couldn't let him leave.
Keep your goddamned mouth shut!

101
00:13:44,027 --> 00:13:48,323
- Keep still or you'll stop breathing.
- Empty the goddamn register!

102
00:13:53,287 --> 00:13:54,955
Get back!

103
00:13:55,289 --> 00:13:56,957
Get back. Get back!

104
00:14:03,006 --> 00:14:06,551
- Well done, Mr. Cage.
- Who the hell are you?

105
00:14:07,051 --> 00:14:10,805
The name's Gibbons.
Augustus Gibbons.

106
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:13,683
You seem upset. Is
there a problem?

107
00:14:13,975 --> 00:14:16,394
- What is this place?
- Looks like a diner.

108
00:14:16,812 --> 00:14:18,689
That's clever.

109
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,359
You almost had me going
there for a while.

110
00:14:22,568 --> 00:14:26,655
I was a bit groggy before, then
I started noticing things.

111
00:14:27,907 --> 00:14:30,951
Like, you got a stockbroker
over here, all dressed up...

112
00:14:31,118 --> 00:14:36,332
reading the Financial Times on
Sunday when the market's closed.

113
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:39,961
Unlikely, but okay,
I can go with that.

114
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:44,216
I could even go with the stick-up
man packing a cop-issue Beretta.

115
00:14:44,382 --> 00:14:48,428
But you want to know where
you blew it? With her.

116
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:51,640
My aunt was in the
restaurant business.

117
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:56,186
There's no way a career waitress
comes to work in high heels.

118
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,940
She'd have blisters
the size of pancakes.

119
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:02,860
And if she ain't real, then
this whole thing ain't real.

120
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:06,531
That's how I knew that this
bozo wouldn't get a shot off...

121
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,617
even if we waited till St.
Patrick's Day.

122
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,747
Because there's nothing
but blanks in these guns.

123
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:19,585
Oh, and no offense...

124
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:24,131
but their performances
were terrible.

125
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,474
That's good. That's very good.

126
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:36,770
It's your turn, pretty boy.

127
00:15:38,648 --> 00:15:42,777
- What the hell is going on here?
- It was a test that you aced.

128
00:15:43,361 --> 00:15:47,448
- He seems to have a poor
attitude. - Excuse me?

129
00:15:47,657 --> 00:15:51,244
- Should we throw him back?
- Hell, no. I love his attitude.

130
00:15:51,412 --> 00:15:54,415
Let's take this to the next
level. Get on the Sat-Com.

131
00:15:54,582 --> 00:15:56,750
Take what to the next level?

132
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,129
- Yo! Take what? - I want
everybody out in 10 minutes.

133
00:16:00,296 --> 00:16:03,174
I don't play this game.

134
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,844
- Get Mike a doctor or he'll
look like me. - I got a party.

135
00:16:07,011 --> 00:16:09,472
- Shut him up.
- And pay for my windows!

136
00:16:16,855 --> 00:16:20,775
Why is it always the
assholes who pass the tests?

137
00:16:43,841 --> 00:16:47,303
You guys haven't been to
any diners lately, huh?

138
00:16:49,598 --> 00:16:51,350
Diner finalists.

139
00:16:59,024 --> 00:17:01,819
- What, no coffee?
- Oh, yeah.

140
00:17:01,944 --> 00:17:04,196
- Here comes the ROTC.
- Here we go.

141
00:17:05,531 --> 00:17:07,825
- Where's my peanuts?
- Nice.

142
00:17:09,577 --> 00:17:11,538
Can you ask for the stewardess?

143
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:19,838
- Standing by to deploy drogue. -
Roger, deploying drogue parachute.

144
00:17:28,973 --> 00:17:30,891
- This will hurt.
- What the hell?

145
00:17:45,406 --> 00:17:47,616
- Release drogue now.
- Roger.

146
00:17:49,661 --> 00:17:51,913
This ain't right!

147
00:17:52,122 --> 00:17:53,790
I live for this shit!

148
00:18:12,643 --> 00:18:14,270
Not bad!

149
00:18:16,689 --> 00:18:18,357
Let's do that again!

150
00:18:32,498 --> 00:18:35,542
Holy shit. This is Colombia.

151
00:18:35,709 --> 00:18:38,754
Cocaine, man. These
are coke plants!

152
00:18:44,637 --> 00:18:46,055
No keys.

153
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:52,061
- What the hell are you doing? -
You know what this shit's worth?

154
00:18:54,146 --> 00:18:57,024
What now? Ls this another test?

155
00:18:57,191 --> 00:19:00,486
- Let's go across the river. Let's
go! - Yeah, good idea! Good idea!

156
00:19:08,662 --> 00:19:12,165
You monkeys are too good for me.
I failed this test.

157
00:19:14,876 --> 00:19:17,337
You guys got something to drink?

158
00:19:29,892 --> 00:19:31,853
Nice to see you again, fellas.

159
00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:33,771
Yeah, you too.

160
00:19:34,689 --> 00:19:37,316
Boy, they went all
out on this one.

161
00:20:05,889 --> 00:20:07,390
You've got to be kidding.

162
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,441
Okay, funny guys.

163
00:20:17,066 --> 00:20:20,445
I'll show you what we do when
you get in our business.

164
00:20:20,946 --> 00:20:25,159
What? Hog-tie us and force us
to listen to your bad accent?

165
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,244
No.

166
00:20:27,828 --> 00:20:32,917
We cut their Achilles tendon and watch
them flop around like a marionette.

167
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:37,796
Unless you have something to tell
me, something I need to know?

168
00:20:37,963 --> 00:20:40,508
Okay. You're short.

169
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:47,515
My friend says you could use a haircut
to update your style. Get off me.

170
00:20:49,433 --> 00:20:50,935
Shut up!

171
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:55,105
Two seconds ago you told us
to talk. Now it's "Shut up"?

172
00:20:55,272 --> 00:20:59,568
I don't mean to nitpick, but you're
the worst at this torture thing.

173
00:21:02,072 --> 00:21:05,325
You slap me again, I'm going
to throw you a beating.

174
00:21:11,331 --> 00:21:13,875
I hope they're paying
you extra for this.

175
00:21:14,292 --> 00:21:18,338
You know what, funny guy? Maybe
I'll cut off your nose first.

176
00:21:18,548 --> 00:21:20,925
Funny guy.

177
00:21:21,092 --> 00:21:25,763
What's funny is, this actually
smells like real blood.

178
00:21:27,139 --> 00:21:31,310
I hope you like it, because it's the
last thing you're going to smell.

179
00:21:56,255 --> 00:21:58,966
I'm hit! I'm hit! I'm hit!

180
00:22:05,556 --> 00:22:07,016
Virg! Give me a hand.

181
00:22:18,445 --> 00:22:19,526
This is the Colombian army!

182
00:22:19,613 --> 00:22:21,281
Give up, you're surrounded!

183
00:22:26,036 --> 00:22:28,205
Try to walk, T.J. Try to walk.

184
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:30,165
Virg! Get out here!

185
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:34,878
To hell with this.
Every man for himself.

186
00:22:57,569 --> 00:22:59,488
I'll get us some wheels.

187
00:23:00,322 --> 00:23:01,782
Hang in there.

188
00:23:02,032 --> 00:23:03,033
Good luck.

189
00:24:16,027 --> 00:24:18,696
The guy on the bike,
that's the drug Lord!

190
00:24:18,988 --> 00:24:20,239
Let's get him!

191
00:24:37,841 --> 00:24:38,842
T.J.!

192
00:25:56,174 --> 00:25:59,010
X! I'm over here! X!

193
00:26:18,113 --> 00:26:19,740
There he is!

194
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:29,063
We toasted his ass!

195
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:41,785
I got us a bike.

196
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:49,627
Pussies!

197
00:27:57,595 --> 00:28:03,517
Look who it is. Frankenstein. Uncuff
me so I can beat the shit out of you.

198
00:28:03,684 --> 00:28:07,021
Relax, X, you just graduated
at the head of your class.

199
00:28:07,146 --> 00:28:10,858
What are you talking about?
You almost got us killed.

200
00:28:10,983 --> 00:28:13,527
- We knew the army was moving.
- Excuse me?

201
00:28:13,694 --> 00:28:17,323
It was my idea to send you as a
decoy. How do you like that?

202
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:24,873
- You're pretty fast for
an old man. - Get up.

203
00:28:27,876 --> 00:28:29,502
Walk with me.

204
00:28:31,295 --> 00:28:35,925
I believe under the right
circumstances, a man can change.

205
00:28:36,134 --> 00:28:40,013
For instance, last night you
exhibited courage, leadership...

206
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,807
and willingness to protect
a man you hardly knew.

207
00:28:42,974 --> 00:28:46,269
- So give me a medal.
- I'd rather give you a job.

208
00:28:46,686 --> 00:28:50,482
Look at me. Do I look like
a fan of law enforcement?

209
00:28:50,815 --> 00:28:52,984
This is your lucky day, Xander.

210
00:28:53,151 --> 00:28:55,904
This is your chance to
pay your Uncle Sam...

211
00:28:56,072 --> 00:28:58,324
for all your
wonderful freedoms.

212
00:28:58,491 --> 00:29:00,326
The job's not that difficult.

213
00:29:00,535 --> 00:29:04,163
I want you to meet people and
find out what you can about them.

214
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:05,998
What type of people?

215
00:29:06,207 --> 00:29:11,462
Dangerous, dirty, tattooed,
uncivilized. Your kind of people.

216
00:29:12,713 --> 00:29:14,173
Hold up.

217
00:29:15,175 --> 00:29:19,847
My kind of people would say,
"Kiss my ass, scarface".

218
00:29:21,014 --> 00:29:24,184
Usually I'd take my gun,
press it to your Temple...

219
00:29:24,309 --> 00:29:27,354
and ask you very
politely to do what I want.

220
00:29:27,563 --> 00:29:31,108
But you're not afraid of death.
That puts us in a quandary.

221
00:29:31,358 --> 00:29:34,862
- We better call this a
day, then. - Not just yet.

222
00:29:36,072 --> 00:29:38,950
You ever watch lions at the zoo?

223
00:29:39,742 --> 00:29:44,289
You can tell which were captured in
the wild by the look in their eyes.

224
00:29:44,455 --> 00:29:45,582
The wild cat.

225
00:29:46,374 --> 00:29:49,711
She remembers running across the
plain, the thrill of the hunt.

226
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,840
Four hundred pounds of killing
fury locked in a box.

227
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:57,344
But after a while, their
eyes glaze over...

228
00:29:57,636 --> 00:30:00,431
and you can tell
their soul has died.

229
00:30:00,973 --> 00:30:03,142
The same thing happens to a man.

230
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:06,020
Leavenworth Federal
Penitentiary is no joke.

231
00:30:06,187 --> 00:30:10,191
They'll take a wild man and throw
him in solitary just for fun.

232
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:15,946
No more mountains to board,
no more oceans to surf.

233
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:21,453
Just a 6-by-8 cell with no window
and only a bucket to shit in.

234
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:24,998
You can avoid that by
doing me this favor.

235
00:30:25,165 --> 00:30:27,292
You don't have shit on me.

236
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:31,463
I noticed you have three X's
tattooed on the back of your neck.

237
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:37,220
I think that's rather appropriate since
you're looking at three strikes.

238
00:30:37,386 --> 00:30:42,016
Grand theft, reckless endangerment,
and that bridge stunt of yours...

239
00:30:42,225 --> 00:30:44,560
makes you a three-time loser.

240
00:30:44,769 --> 00:30:47,730
Maybe you ought to call
yourself "Triple X".

241
00:30:48,732 --> 00:30:53,403
But if you do what I want, I'll make
all your transgressions go away...

242
00:30:53,571 --> 00:30:57,200
and let you get back to that
pathetic excuse of a life.

243
00:30:59,244 --> 00:31:01,913
Or you think maybe I
should be like you.

244
00:31:03,206 --> 00:31:06,334
Get all shot up for the
old Stars and Stripes.

245
00:31:06,793 --> 00:31:11,256
I bet that flag is a real comfort
every time you look in the mirror.

246
00:31:11,422 --> 00:31:16,302
A small price I paid for putting
foot to ass for my country.

247
00:31:21,015 --> 00:31:23,768
So, what's it going
to be, Triple X?

248
00:31:23,935 --> 00:31:26,396
You want to get on a plane...

249
00:31:26,604 --> 00:31:31,276
or is "Kiss my ass,
scarface" your final answer?

250
00:31:41,453 --> 00:31:44,832
Prague, Czech Republic.

251
00:32:00,181 --> 00:32:02,058
Yo. What's your name, slick?

252
00:32:02,225 --> 00:32:03,476
My name is Ivan.

253
00:32:03,685 --> 00:32:07,856
- Ivan? What's your name,
buddy? - My name is Ivan.

254
00:32:08,024 --> 00:32:09,734
You're both Ivan?

255
00:32:39,139 --> 00:32:40,807
Take a seat.

256
00:32:41,516 --> 00:32:44,269
Idiots! Where is the
American agent?

257
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:45,480
This is him, Sir.

258
00:32:47,148 --> 00:32:49,734
We better order another bodybag.

259
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:52,487
Guys, what's up?

260
00:32:54,155 --> 00:32:55,490
I told you to sit down.

261
00:32:55,949 --> 00:32:59,702
I've just been on a plane for
12 hours. I think I'll stand.

262
00:32:59,869 --> 00:33:03,039
My name is Milan Sova,
Czech secret police.

263
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:05,833
Here, you are under
my jurisdiction.

264
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,420
You take my orders,
you do what I say.

265
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:12,049
If you become any kind of an
inconvenience, I'll shoot you.

266
00:33:12,508 --> 00:33:15,135
That's great. Is this
where I'm staying?

267
00:33:15,302 --> 00:33:18,556
Your government is putting
pressure on mine.

268
00:33:18,722 --> 00:33:22,643
This is an internal Czech affair
that you are interfering with.

269
00:33:22,811 --> 00:33:25,772
I will warn you Don't
shit in my lawn.

270
00:33:25,981 --> 00:33:30,652
Get whatever information your
government seeks and get out.

271
00:33:31,111 --> 00:33:32,612
Let's get this straight.

272
00:33:32,821 --> 00:33:36,533
You may not want me here, but I
definitely don't want to be here.

273
00:33:36,741 --> 00:33:40,078
Two, I've never been under
anyone's jurisdiction.

274
00:33:40,787 --> 00:33:43,123
Three, if you're going
to shoot anybody...

275
00:33:43,374 --> 00:33:45,918
shoot that monkey
that sold you the suit.

276
00:33:46,085 --> 00:33:48,671
Now, I'm tired. I'm
going to sleep.

277
00:33:50,674 --> 00:33:53,218
Be ready in three hours.

278
00:33:57,806 --> 00:34:00,601
Everybody in this club
has two things in common

279
00:34:00,768 --> 00:34:06,858
- They're rich and they're criminals. -
I'll fit in, except for the rich part.

280
00:34:21,248 --> 00:34:24,793
- Remember, we don't know each
other. - I wish we didn't.

281
00:34:39,017 --> 00:34:41,519
Yeah, can I get a
cranberry club soda?

282
00:34:42,562 --> 00:34:46,191
Throw this back there?
I'll tip you something.

283
00:34:46,358 --> 00:34:48,526
Put it in the back.

284
00:34:49,903 --> 00:34:52,864
How much? Do I get a ticket?

285
00:34:57,786 --> 00:35:01,039
That's them. Anarchy 99.

286
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:03,084
You see the guy on the couch?

287
00:35:03,209 --> 00:35:05,711
That's Yorgi. He's the leader.

288
00:35:05,878 --> 00:35:10,550
He owns this club and five others like
it. All, how do you say, cash cows.

289
00:35:10,716 --> 00:35:12,176
American?!

290
00:35:15,054 --> 00:35:18,266
Guys, I'm American. I'm
going to see Yorgi. Yorgi!

291
00:35:18,517 --> 00:35:20,811
Hey, Yorgi! I hear
you're the guy...

292
00:35:24,648 --> 00:35:26,900
I heard you're the guy
to talk to about cars.

293
00:35:27,276 --> 00:35:28,485
Take yourself outside.

294
00:35:28,986 --> 00:35:31,280
Take myself outside? I'm just...

295
00:35:33,115 --> 00:35:35,701
Okay. I'm not welcome.

296
00:35:35,868 --> 00:35:38,412
Guess you'd rather have
cops in your club.

297
00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:42,834
Want to talk?

298
00:35:43,334 --> 00:35:46,963
Hey, you silly boy. Come with
me and show me the cop...

299
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:49,132
and don't be mistake.

300
00:35:49,382 --> 00:35:52,719
See that guy there, with the
suit made out of drapes?

301
00:35:52,886 --> 00:35:54,637
That's a cop.

302
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,938
Is there a problem? I just
had a drink, you know?

303
00:36:03,397 --> 00:36:08,152
I already paid. I'm going to
give a big tip, you know?

304
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:17,953
So, what is this all about?
I've done nothing.

305
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:21,625
You've done nothing?
Who do you work for?

306
00:36:22,751 --> 00:36:25,086
I work in a bank. So what?

307
00:36:25,712 --> 00:36:27,380
You've got to be...

308
00:36:28,048 --> 00:36:31,384
What are you doing?
Stop it! Stop it!

309
00:36:33,594 --> 00:36:35,888
What's that, your bus pass?

310
00:36:36,056 --> 00:36:38,934
Czech 5-0. Czech 5-0.

311
00:36:41,353 --> 00:36:42,395
Leave my club.

312
00:36:45,774 --> 00:36:47,192
How did you know?

313
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:52,656
When he was paying for his drinks, he
was flashing his badge to half the bar.

314
00:36:52,824 --> 00:36:54,034
Cops like plague.

315
00:36:54,243 --> 00:36:58,247
No matter how many you pay, there's
always another with his hand out.

316
00:36:58,413 --> 00:37:00,874
I'm from the streets. I
know cops, believe me.

317
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:05,754
I appreciate you bringing this to our
attention. My question to you is why?

318
00:37:06,171 --> 00:37:09,091
I figure, no one likes
cops crashing their party.

319
00:37:09,258 --> 00:37:12,010
I figure, I do you a
solid, we could talk.

320
00:37:13,555 --> 00:37:16,057
I just want to buy cars, man.

321
00:37:17,433 --> 00:37:19,644
Is this guy going
to hump my leg?

322
00:37:21,437 --> 00:37:22,772
What's your name?

323
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,651
Xander Cage.

324
00:37:28,778 --> 00:37:30,321
I knew it.

325
00:37:30,488 --> 00:37:34,617
You are amazing on snowboard,
motorbike, everything.

326
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:37,204
- You're awesome.
- Thank you, man.

327
00:37:37,371 --> 00:37:41,667
My brother is crazy too, and
a great admirer of yours.

328
00:37:41,834 --> 00:37:45,421
He has seen your tapes many
times. Now we can talk business.

329
00:37:45,588 --> 00:37:47,131
This way, please.

330
00:37:47,882 --> 00:37:49,508
Yelena.

331
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,639
Welcome to the Xander zone.

332
00:37:55,223 --> 00:37:58,059
Now, that's funny. That's funny.

333
00:37:58,226 --> 00:38:00,145
Sit down, Mr. Cage.

334
00:38:00,312 --> 00:38:02,105
My friends call me X.

335
00:38:02,272 --> 00:38:05,025
So, X, what exactly
are you wanting?

336
00:38:06,276 --> 00:38:10,572
Ferraris, high-end pasta
rockets, 10 to start.

337
00:38:13,492 --> 00:38:17,747
This car, number 10, will be very
difficult to find in Europe.

338
00:38:18,122 --> 00:38:23,252
That one's for me. I put it in there
to get something out of the deal.

339
00:38:23,419 --> 00:38:25,087
Well, you certainly
know your cars.

340
00:38:25,254 --> 00:38:28,758
Yeah. Cars, bikes, boards.
You name it.

341
00:38:29,009 --> 00:38:32,095
I like anything fast enough
to do something stupid in.

342
00:38:32,262 --> 00:38:33,305
Yes.

343
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:37,935
Ten cars is hardly worth the
effort. A lousy 1.5 million, U.S.

344
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,479
Now, hold on a second.

345
00:38:40,687 --> 00:38:45,859
The American buyers I represent,
to them, 10 cars is an appetizer.

346
00:38:46,068 --> 00:38:49,780
- And it's a mil Max, sister.
- How about a million four?

347
00:38:50,031 --> 00:38:53,284
I was thinking more
like a mil two.

348
00:38:55,662 --> 00:38:58,373
Do you know what a
wire transfer is?

349
00:38:58,665 --> 00:39:00,250
Is she for real?

350
00:39:00,375 --> 00:39:03,211
Sweetheart, is there
anything you need to do?

351
00:39:03,336 --> 00:39:06,464
Let us big boys have
a conversation.

352
00:39:06,632 --> 00:39:09,301
"Conversation", a word
with four syllables.

353
00:39:09,468 --> 00:39:12,555
Do you want some ice before
your brain overheats?

354
00:39:12,721 --> 00:39:17,851
Ice. Yeah, you could chisel some off
your heart, if you could find it.

355
00:39:22,856 --> 00:39:27,820
This would work a lot faster,
princess, if I had an account number.

356
00:39:31,741 --> 00:39:36,580
You have 48 hours to
complete the transfer.

357
00:39:36,746 --> 00:39:39,624
- Don't waste my time.
- I wouldn't dream of it.

358
00:39:40,417 --> 00:39:45,589
I might throw in a couple extra
bucks and send you to charm school.

359
00:39:50,761 --> 00:39:53,723
Now that business is
finished, we party.

360
00:39:56,476 --> 00:39:58,312
Bitches, come!

361
00:40:25,007 --> 00:40:26,175
Yeah?

362
00:40:31,722 --> 00:40:34,183
Shit, I thought this
was a cell phone.

363
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:35,434
Have a nice rest?

364
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:38,562
Dial it down. I got
to sleep an hour ago.

365
00:40:38,729 --> 00:40:42,816
You were given a specific list of
cars. Who told you to alter it?

366
00:40:42,984 --> 00:40:45,904
The cars sucked. They
would've seen through it.

367
00:40:46,071 --> 00:40:48,782
You guys should
switch travel agents.

368
00:40:49,282 --> 00:40:51,409
I got that info you wanted.

369
00:40:51,576 --> 00:40:53,620
Hang on a second.

370
00:40:54,663 --> 00:40:56,164
You guys ready for this?

371
00:41:01,002 --> 00:41:04,714
Names, birthdays, ranks
in the Red Army.

372
00:41:04,924 --> 00:41:07,260
Favorite foods? How
did you get this?

373
00:41:07,385 --> 00:41:11,389
Kolya, Yorgi's younger brother, happens
to be an action sports fanatic.

374
00:41:11,597 --> 00:41:13,182
So naturally, he's a fan.

375
00:41:13,307 --> 00:41:17,019
But when you kill a bottle of vodka
in three swigs, you'll talk.

376
00:41:17,186 --> 00:41:19,146
- I got something else.
- What?

377
00:41:19,313 --> 00:41:23,109
Their personal bank account
number. Where did I put that?

378
00:41:28,031 --> 00:41:31,451
Stolen cars, nightclubs,
prostitution, extortion.

379
00:41:31,618 --> 00:41:35,205
What's the big deal? We got
criminals like this in the U.S.

380
00:41:35,372 --> 00:41:37,749
Your job isn't to ask questions.

381
00:41:37,958 --> 00:41:41,962
Well, I did my job, thank you.
I'm coming home.

382
00:41:42,171 --> 00:41:43,381
Not just yet.

383
00:41:43,548 --> 00:41:48,136
You're a victim of your own
success. Get closer to these guys.

384
00:41:48,302 --> 00:41:51,513
- They're cool, but not
that cool. - Go deeper.

385
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,349
I'll send a guy with a
care package to help you.

386
00:41:54,516 --> 00:41:59,271
- I thought we had a deal. - You
change cars, I change the deal.

387
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,649
Do this for me, you
can come home.

388
00:42:01,858 --> 00:42:07,155
If you send someone to save the world,
make sure they like it the way it is.

389
00:42:18,167 --> 00:42:22,463
I have a really firm chest.
I bench, like, 225.

390
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:25,466
Like, bench. Weight room. Bye.

391
00:42:25,633 --> 00:42:30,095
- That's him.
- Wait. You're Triple X?

392
00:42:30,304 --> 00:42:33,933
- You're the care package?
- Agent Toby Lee Shavers.

393
00:42:34,099 --> 00:42:35,351
Come on.

394
00:42:35,517 --> 00:42:39,104
You have to rate high to get
Gibbons to send this stuff.

395
00:42:39,272 --> 00:42:44,152
I kind of wish I was going with you,
mixed up in the fury of the situation.

396
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:47,530
Crazy. License to kill,
death, destruction, mayhem.

397
00:42:47,739 --> 00:42:52,702
Got a gun under your pillow. Never know
when some freak villain will pop out.

398
00:42:54,287 --> 00:42:56,456
- How long you been with
the agency? - Two days.

399
00:42:56,667 --> 00:42:59,211
You're shitting me. No way.

400
00:42:59,461 --> 00:43:01,505
That sucks.

401
00:43:02,047 --> 00:43:04,258
Yeah, it sucks, but
it beats jail.

402
00:43:04,424 --> 00:43:06,635
It sucks because I
spent six years...

403
00:43:06,885 --> 00:43:11,390
in the basement of some windowless,
NSA, gadget freak room, man.

404
00:43:11,515 --> 00:43:14,059
And I got a degree. I
got a degree from MIT.

405
00:43:14,226 --> 00:43:17,104
Phi Beta Kappa, Magna cum laude.

406
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:22,068
And they probably picked you up,
what, pumping iron in San Quentin?

407
00:43:22,235 --> 00:43:25,572
You ever get punched in the
face for talking too much?

408
00:43:25,738 --> 00:43:26,990
Show me the stuff.

409
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:31,828
This one made my career, the
definition of perfection

410
00:43:31,953 --> 00:43:35,373
My multi-purpose,
multi-function field revolver.

411
00:43:38,502 --> 00:43:40,879
- Oh, I like this.
- Then you'll love these.

412
00:43:41,046 --> 00:43:44,383
These are all attachment darts.
See the green ones?

413
00:43:44,717 --> 00:43:46,719
Datura knockout darts.

414
00:43:46,885 --> 00:43:50,889
Guy goes down for 12 hours, wakes
up, doesn't know who he is...

415
00:43:51,056 --> 00:43:54,351
and his head's splitting
like a cord of firewood.

416
00:43:54,686 --> 00:43:57,480
I was shot twice by those.

417
00:43:57,647 --> 00:44:01,192
And the red ones are tranquilizer
and blood-splatter darts.

418
00:44:01,318 --> 00:44:05,238
Looks like a kill shot without
the aftereffects. Like death.

419
00:44:05,405 --> 00:44:07,991
You've got exploding and
surveillance darts...

420
00:44:08,116 --> 00:44:12,329
and your standard .44-caliber
bullets, if you want to get nasty.

421
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:16,584
A little wet work. You know
what I'm talking about, right?

422
00:44:20,922 --> 00:44:23,090
Knocked over a few
7-Elevens, have we?

423
00:44:23,257 --> 00:44:28,346
No, I had my leg in a cast for three
months. All I did was play video games.

424
00:44:28,512 --> 00:44:30,306
That's a really sad story.

425
00:44:30,473 --> 00:44:32,600
Check this out, on to my baby.

426
00:44:35,354 --> 00:44:38,065
Eagle Eyes. Nine
enhanced-vision modes.

427
00:44:38,273 --> 00:44:42,319
Every little boy's
The penetrator mode.

428
00:44:42,486 --> 00:44:43,695
Check it out.

429
00:44:52,288 --> 00:44:54,832
Oh, my God.

430
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:58,544
- She's checking you out, man.
- I'll hang on to these.

431
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:01,214
Now, on to my
latest achievement.

432
00:45:01,589 --> 00:45:04,968
I just put the finishing
touches on them last week.

433
00:45:05,593 --> 00:45:07,178
What do you think?

434
00:45:07,512 --> 00:45:10,431
- Bandages?
- No, Mr. X, watch and learn.

435
00:45:10,557 --> 00:45:13,686
There's enough primer to
blow a hole in a vault...

436
00:45:13,852 --> 00:45:17,731
vaporize a human, or whatever
agents like you might find a use for.

437
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:19,650
And check this out.

438
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:22,236
The detonator. How cool is that?

439
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:28,409
- You might want to back up
for this. - It's a bandage.

440
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:30,870
Just get behind the wall.

441
00:45:32,664 --> 00:45:33,999
You ready?

442
00:45:34,165 --> 00:45:36,334
I've always wanted to say this.

443
00:45:37,836 --> 00:45:39,254
Fire in the hole.

444
00:46:02,154 --> 00:46:04,323
It's loaded.

445
00:46:26,096 --> 00:46:30,142
So, what do you think?
Beautiful.

446
00:46:30,894 --> 00:46:32,979
You like the cars?

447
00:46:33,897 --> 00:46:36,483
I love the cars, they're dope.

448
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:41,363
- You like the money? - I love
money, but I do not have it.

449
00:46:41,571 --> 00:46:46,159
You look like you're doing very well.
All these employees, beautiful cars.

450
00:46:46,452 --> 00:46:48,579
This is no time for being funny.

451
00:47:01,926 --> 00:47:06,889
- You didn't think I wasn't good for
it? - It never crossed my mind.

452
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:13,354
A cargo ship's waiting for you
in Rijeka. Here's the address.

453
00:47:16,399 --> 00:47:17,692
This place is dope.

454
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:21,195
This one's mine?

455
00:47:21,404 --> 00:47:22,863
Car number 10.

456
00:47:23,281 --> 00:47:27,118
Kolya found it hiding in Berlin.
It was very difficult to find.

457
00:47:27,286 --> 00:47:28,870
No! Please.

458
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:32,249
Allow me. You were kind
enough to give me the money.

459
00:47:40,674 --> 00:47:41,967
Now, please...

460
00:47:42,342 --> 00:47:43,927
drive.

461
00:47:48,474 --> 00:47:49,851
No, allow me.

462
00:48:02,406 --> 00:48:06,535
- You're all right, Yorgi. -
Everything's all right with vodka.

463
00:48:07,202 --> 00:48:11,081
You must come to party tonight.
Big party at one of my clubs.

464
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:12,708
- Yeah?
- Yes.

465
00:48:32,854 --> 00:48:35,023
What's going on, my friend?

466
00:48:35,231 --> 00:48:38,526
You tell me. You got a
sniper up there or what?

467
00:48:38,693 --> 00:48:41,029
He's not with us, he
must be with you.

468
00:48:41,197 --> 00:48:44,283
Bullshit! Tell your
men to get down...

469
00:48:44,408 --> 00:48:48,204
or I'll give you another hole
to breathe out of. Are we clear?

470
00:48:53,209 --> 00:48:56,379
All right. It's not yours.

471
00:48:56,587 --> 00:48:58,714
Let's go and get him together.

472
00:49:32,418 --> 00:49:35,296
Son of a bitch. That
same cop from the club.

473
00:49:35,504 --> 00:49:37,131
Filthy cop.

474
00:50:06,954 --> 00:50:10,833
Most people talk a lot. Few
are up for the moment.

475
00:50:11,459 --> 00:50:14,337
Welcome to Anarchy 99.

476
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:09,185
- Did you enjoy that?
- Yeah.

477
00:51:09,393 --> 00:51:12,313
Good, because it will
never happen again.

478
00:51:39,817 --> 00:51:41,377
- After you.
- No, after you.

479
00:51:41,541 --> 00:51:44,251
- No, after you.
- No, I insist.

480
00:51:49,465 --> 00:51:50,532
That's it.

481
00:51:53,161 --> 00:51:55,501
Last chance to tuck me in.

482
00:51:57,265 --> 00:51:58,662
Good morning.

483
00:53:28,343 --> 00:53:31,471
It's none of my business, but a power
drill and some titanium bits...

484
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,521
will get you a lot
further than that camera.

485
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,892
You're not supposed
to be in here.

486
00:53:36,059 --> 00:53:38,147
I was on my way to the bathroom.

487
00:53:40,607 --> 00:53:42,525
What's your excuse?

488
00:53:43,193 --> 00:53:45,195
I don't need an excuse.

489
00:53:47,992 --> 00:53:49,368
Oh, you're good.

490
00:53:50,995 --> 00:53:52,748
But not that good.

491
00:53:52,872 --> 00:53:56,209
I came in here to
photograph Yorgi's safe.

492
00:53:56,418 --> 00:53:59,047
I thought it might be
worth a lot to somebody.

493
00:53:59,255 --> 00:54:02,925
Come on. You're cold,
intelligent and vicious.

494
00:54:05,012 --> 00:54:07,139
It's your eyes that
give you away.

495
00:54:08,433 --> 00:54:11,103
They gave you away
when I shot that cop.

496
00:54:13,731 --> 00:54:15,650
What are you going to do now?

497
00:54:19,864 --> 00:54:22,575
Now I'm going to
take you to lunch.

498
00:54:24,369 --> 00:54:27,873
Oh, and that cop I
shot, isn't dead.

499
00:54:48,483 --> 00:54:50,984
I have some information for you.

500
00:54:52,821 --> 00:54:57,827
I can always use information. Who is
this? How did you get this number?

501
00:54:58,911 --> 00:55:04,208
Yes. Important information that
you need about Xander Cage.

502
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:18,685
- So you don't like foreigners,
do you? - No, you're a pig.

503
00:55:19,937 --> 00:55:22,022
Is your boyfriend a pig too?

504
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:24,777
You should recognize
one of your kind.

505
00:55:24,986 --> 00:55:26,779
Now, tell me about the cop.

506
00:55:29,031 --> 00:55:32,535
What if I told you I'm
not who you think I am?

507
00:55:33,871 --> 00:55:35,873
That I could get you out
of the mess you're in?

508
00:55:36,081 --> 00:55:38,292
Really? And what mess am I in?

509
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:43,590
The mess that makes you sneak around
the castle when everyone's asleep.

510
00:55:43,759 --> 00:55:44,885
The cop?

511
00:55:48,013 --> 00:55:51,768
See this? It's called a
blood-splatter dart.

512
00:55:51,935 --> 00:55:56,231
The impact's real, but it's
harmless. Red paint, mostly.

513
00:55:58,149 --> 00:55:59,110
Why?

514
00:56:01,072 --> 00:56:02,572
I'm a secret agent.

515
00:56:09,497 --> 00:56:12,251
Are you sure you don't
want to embarrass me?

516
00:56:12,834 --> 00:56:15,254
- Come on.
- What's so funny about that?

517
00:56:16,839 --> 00:56:19,093
I mean, look at you.

518
00:56:19,344 --> 00:56:21,888
I work for the NSA.

519
00:56:24,432 --> 00:56:26,518
You're funny, you know that?

520
00:56:30,731 --> 00:56:32,400
Yelena, it's Kirill.

521
00:56:32,984 --> 00:56:36,823
Yorgi found out that Cage
is an American agent.

522
00:56:37,448 --> 00:56:42,413
Do you understand what I'm telling
you? You are in danger, my love.

523
00:56:43,123 --> 00:56:45,792
The building across the street.
The statue.

524
00:56:46,877 --> 00:56:50,047
Bring him outside. I
will do the rest.

525
00:56:56,930 --> 00:56:59,225
What was that, your boyfriend?

526
00:57:05,441 --> 00:57:08,946
Let's say you are who
you say you are.

527
00:57:10,573 --> 00:57:13,659
- What can you do for me?
- What do you want?

528
00:57:14,994 --> 00:57:20,334
I want immunity from prosecution,
asylum in the U.S. and citizenship.

529
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:23,129
How about a condo on South
Beach and a rich boyfriend?

530
00:57:23,255 --> 00:57:25,340
Those I can get for myself.

531
00:57:26,675 --> 00:57:29,888
- What do you want? - I need
to know more about Anarchy 99.

532
00:57:30,263 --> 00:57:32,557
You want to know
about Anarchy 99?

533
00:57:33,308 --> 00:57:36,812
You've seen the girls,
the clubs, the parties.

534
00:57:36,896 --> 00:57:40,693
What you don't see is what
goes on during the day.

535
00:57:41,277 --> 00:57:46,366
There's been a lot of activity in the
last year. People coming in and out.

536
00:57:46,574 --> 00:57:50,453
- Russian scientists.
- Well, what are they up to?

537
00:57:50,912 --> 00:57:54,040
They go in the basement
and I'm not allowed in.

538
00:57:54,542 --> 00:57:57,378
Now's a good time for
you to get invited.

539
00:57:58,047 --> 00:58:04,012
Yorgi knows you're an agent.
Kirill is waiting with his rifle.

540
00:58:09,978 --> 00:58:11,437
- Where...?
- Don't look!

541
00:58:12,563 --> 00:58:14,524
There's a back door.

542
00:58:14,818 --> 00:58:16,987
They'll know you warned me.

543
00:58:17,113 --> 00:58:20,659
If you go out the front, he'll
put a bullet in your eye.

544
00:58:31,212 --> 00:58:33,882
- You still packing?
- Always.

545
00:58:34,174 --> 00:58:36,094
Get ready to use it.

546
00:58:39,097 --> 00:58:42,101
- What's your plan?
- He's still in love with you.

547
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:47,691
- He'll wait for a clear shot. -
That's your plan? Thank you. Great.

548
00:59:12,014 --> 00:59:13,055
Draw!

549
01:00:02,698 --> 01:00:04,619
He's on the way.

550
01:00:42,248 --> 01:00:46,795
Gibbons! My favorite kidnapper.
Next time send a limo.

551
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:56,265
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

552
01:00:56,515 --> 01:01:00,645
You already broke me. No need
to get cruel and unusual.

553
01:01:04,149 --> 01:01:06,234
A ticket? Now, that's funny.

554
01:01:06,447 --> 01:01:08,990
- Where am I going to go now?
- Home.

555
01:01:09,824 --> 01:01:10,743
Home?

556
01:01:11,117 --> 01:01:13,411
Your cover's blown.
You're not useful.

557
01:01:13,622 --> 01:01:14,914
That's it? I'm done?

558
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:18,668
No tricks. We have enough
intel to move forward.

559
01:01:18,877 --> 01:01:23,758
- With what? - Sweeper
Quick, clean, effective.

560
01:01:23,883 --> 01:01:26,886
Don't worry about it.
It'll all be over soon.

561
01:01:27,429 --> 01:01:30,725
You mean a sweeper team to
come in and kill everybody?

562
01:01:30,934 --> 01:01:33,687
Not all of them are
as bad as you think.

563
01:01:33,854 --> 01:01:37,901
You had to shoot a cop. How "not
as bad as I think" could they be?

564
01:01:38,108 --> 01:01:40,195
Okay, look.

565
01:01:40,444 --> 01:01:44,157
We've got a complication.
There's a girl. Yelena.

566
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:45,868
There's always a girl.

567
01:01:46,078 --> 01:01:50,040
She wants out and I sent her back
in to get more intel for you.

568
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:54,338
There's no time to play favorites.
The cards have been dealt.

569
01:01:54,546 --> 01:01:57,131
What do you mean the
cards have been dealt?

570
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:59,636
You don't even know her, man.

571
01:02:01,263 --> 01:02:04,724
Oh, by the way, that
bank number you gave us?

572
01:02:05,351 --> 01:02:11,023
Your friends and Yelena have made
some large cash transfers...

573
01:02:11,233 --> 01:02:15,405
to a group of Russian scientists
known to specialize and traffic...

574
01:02:15,572 --> 01:02:18,198
in biological weapons.

575
01:02:18,783 --> 01:02:21,661
- She had nothing to
do with it. - Go home.

576
01:02:21,912 --> 01:02:23,789
- She ain't...!
- That's an order.

577
01:02:44,148 --> 01:02:45,192
How's it going?

578
01:02:45,317 --> 01:02:46,610
Life is shit!

579
01:02:46,817 --> 01:02:48,653
Yeah, well what can you do?

580
01:04:42,251 --> 01:04:45,464
Through this door, you
are with us to the end.

581
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:48,968
- Are you sure that's what
you want? - I'm sure.

582
01:06:28,965 --> 01:06:33,554
This is Ahab. Think of it
as solar-powered submarine.

583
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:36,767
It can circumnavigate the
globe to reach its target.

584
01:06:37,018 --> 01:06:41,856
It need only surface to gather
sunshine and to do its business.

585
01:06:42,273 --> 01:06:44,985
What is it? What's its business?

586
01:06:45,402 --> 01:06:50,491
Dropping off presents to all the
good little boys and girls.

587
01:07:00,088 --> 01:07:03,131
My team will be
finished tomorrow.

588
01:07:03,675 --> 01:07:04,675
How about you?

589
01:07:05,718 --> 01:07:08,555
We're finished now.

590
01:07:40,387 --> 01:07:41,430
Nikolai!

591
01:07:41,722 --> 01:07:43,766
Bring the rockets.

592
01:08:20,977 --> 01:08:23,856
The detonator is for you.

593
01:09:13,751 --> 01:09:16,087
Yorgi! The binary
agents are mixing...

594
01:09:16,211 --> 01:09:18,339
it will kill us all!

595
01:09:28,519 --> 01:09:31,104
Looks like little white mouse.

596
01:09:34,610 --> 01:09:36,445
Bye-bye, little mouse.

597
01:09:54,174 --> 01:09:55,594
My God.

598
01:10:57,169 --> 01:11:01,258
They did their job and
now they were liability.

599
01:11:02,218 --> 01:11:05,888
We don't need anyone talking
about our business.

600
01:11:11,353 --> 01:11:15,942
The gas gets sucked through the
extractor fans, passed into water...

601
01:11:16,151 --> 01:11:20,114
and broken down to become,
once again, completely harmless.

602
01:11:23,870 --> 01:11:25,830
So quiet.

603
01:11:28,708 --> 01:11:32,546
I know now why they
call it Silent Night.

604
01:11:41,182 --> 01:11:42,643
Let's get some food.

605
01:12:17,977 --> 01:12:19,896
Find out what's going on!

606
01:12:54,188 --> 01:12:55,356
What the hell was that?

607
01:13:02,031 --> 01:13:03,574
That works.

608
01:14:30,681 --> 01:14:32,057
Fire in the hole.

609
01:15:01,426 --> 01:15:04,388
Sova. What are you
doing here, man?

610
01:15:04,556 --> 01:15:07,976
First you set me up in the bar.
Then you shoot me in the back.

611
01:15:08,227 --> 01:15:11,857
My boss does it to me. I did it
to you. It's a vicious circle.

612
01:15:12,106 --> 01:15:13,734
- You think it's funny?
- No.

613
01:15:13,942 --> 01:15:16,612
You didn't take it
personally, did you?

614
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:20,492
I did what I had to do to get
in. We're on the same side.

615
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:23,578
I'm sorry. I switched sides.

616
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:28,541
You pushed me too far. My government
doesn't pay as well as Yorgi.

617
01:15:29,544 --> 01:15:31,755
My government pays
twice as much...

618
01:15:31,964 --> 01:15:34,717
Think you could just walk
into the spy business...

619
01:15:34,842 --> 01:15:40,014
and have all the angles figured out?
- What are you going to do, shoot me?

620
01:15:40,225 --> 01:15:42,185
Where? In the head, to be quick?

621
01:15:42,394 --> 01:15:45,772
Or in the chest for an open
casket, so I can see your heart?

622
01:15:45,981 --> 01:15:47,943
Can I think about it?

623
01:15:55,993 --> 01:15:57,328
What are you doing?!

624
01:15:57,538 --> 01:16:01,417
I heard you talking. I could
tell where you were in the room.

625
01:16:03,127 --> 01:16:05,588
What are you doing
with the Ivans?

626
01:16:09,511 --> 01:16:10,636
What's going on?

627
01:16:10,803 --> 01:16:14,348
There's something I didn't
have the time to tell you.

628
01:16:14,474 --> 01:16:16,560
I'm an agent as well.

629
01:16:16,769 --> 01:16:20,190
I'm an agent for FSB,
Russian Intelligence.

630
01:16:20,358 --> 01:16:22,444
You know, like your CIA.

631
01:16:22,569 --> 01:16:25,613
- I've been undercover for
two years. - Two years?

632
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:28,534
What was your plan, let
them die of old age?

633
01:16:28,744 --> 01:16:30,078
There was no plan.

634
01:16:30,245 --> 01:16:34,792
A year ago, Intelligence gets
reorganized, I stop getting orders.

635
01:16:35,208 --> 01:16:39,798
They forget about me. And I did what
I must to survive. You understand?

636
01:16:40,006 --> 01:16:43,343
What do I understand? I've
been an agent for a week.

637
01:16:43,469 --> 01:16:46,473
But my boss needs to
know what we know now.

638
01:16:46,598 --> 01:16:49,435
- Okay?
- Okay.

639
01:16:50,436 --> 01:16:54,608
The submarine's purpose is to deploy
a nerve agent called Silent Night.

640
01:16:54,816 --> 01:16:58,028
It's been missing since the
Soviet Union's collapse in '91.

641
01:16:58,237 --> 01:16:59,530
It can kill millions.

642
01:16:59,739 --> 01:17:02,784
We knew they were up to
something. You found out.

643
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:07,123
- That's excellent work, Triple X.
- There was never a sweeper team.

644
01:17:08,709 --> 01:17:11,713
If I said don't jump off the
Empire State Building...

645
01:17:11,879 --> 01:17:15,217
- You're right. I'd definitely
do it. - I inspired you.

646
01:17:15,466 --> 01:17:18,887
I'm an authority figure, that's
what I'm supposed to do.

647
01:17:19,097 --> 01:17:21,139
Look, my men are on this now.

648
01:17:21,265 --> 01:17:24,645
- It's time for you to come
home. - What about Yelena?

649
01:17:28,065 --> 01:17:31,111
I'm not authorized
to give her asylum.

650
01:17:32,571 --> 01:17:35,783
But I promise it'll be done
by the time you get here.

651
01:17:37,284 --> 01:17:40,246
Come home, Xander.
That's an order.

652
01:17:57,183 --> 01:17:59,979
How soon can Yorgi
launch this thing?

653
01:18:03,692 --> 01:18:07,029
You were told to go home!
Your people are handling...

654
01:18:07,238 --> 01:18:09,158
How soon, Yelena?

655
01:18:11,578 --> 01:18:14,289
Soon. But it's not
our problem anymore!

656
01:18:14,414 --> 01:18:17,333
If they get ahead of
schedule, it's everyone's.

657
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:21,881
He's got an army, a fortress.
You don't stand a chance!

658
01:18:22,049 --> 01:18:26,888
I've risked my life for stupid reasons.
This is the first one that makes sense.

659
01:18:27,096 --> 01:18:31,560
This is not one of your stunts.
You'll die in this, you know that.

660
01:18:33,936 --> 01:18:36,357
If you don't go back in there...

661
01:18:38,151 --> 01:18:40,738
he'll know something's wrong.

662
01:18:40,821 --> 01:18:44,618
You can't ask me to go
back there. You can't.

663
01:18:47,497 --> 01:18:52,377
You want to know something ironic?
I volunteered for this assignment.

664
01:18:53,711 --> 01:18:56,423
I wanted to make a difference.

665
01:18:57,591 --> 01:18:59,218
I fought for it.

666
01:19:03,057 --> 01:19:04,266
Then finish it.

667
01:19:21,996 --> 01:19:25,291
Remember what I told you,
after you kissed me?

668
01:19:25,751 --> 01:19:28,254
- Never again?
- I lied.

669
01:19:46,776 --> 01:19:50,030
But when you break it
down, I'm a simple man.

670
01:19:50,156 --> 01:19:52,367
I'd be happy with a
beautiful Czech girl...

671
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:56,538
Hey, geek! Got new orders
from Gibbons. Get in.

672
01:20:01,586 --> 01:20:04,883
- I want all that in here.
- Done.

673
01:20:05,008 --> 01:20:08,428
The castle's covered with
surveillance cameras.

674
01:20:09,555 --> 01:20:12,141
That's why we cannot
get close enough.

675
01:20:14,561 --> 01:20:19,983
Hang on. That's why I need to knock
out the communications tower...

676
01:20:20,151 --> 01:20:22,195
at the base of the mountain.

677
01:20:27,868 --> 01:20:30,997
Is there anyone here who
knows how to fly a plane?

678
01:20:32,292 --> 01:20:33,627
I can.

679
01:20:40,927 --> 01:20:43,513
Too much turbulence
around these mountains!

680
01:20:43,764 --> 01:20:46,390
Just get me in line
with that tower!

681
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:48,060
I'll do the rest!

682
01:21:01,868 --> 01:21:02,870
Go now!

683
01:22:24,970 --> 01:22:26,347
Viktor! We got company!

684
01:22:31,228 --> 01:22:34,148
Catch him fast. Kill him slow!

685
01:26:24,764 --> 01:26:26,559
Nothing like fresh powder.

686
01:27:03,436 --> 01:27:07,608
Yelena, my sweet dove,
did you get confused?

687
01:27:08,026 --> 01:27:12,738
Your assignment was to kill
the cop after he killed X.

688
01:27:13,741 --> 01:27:18,205
Not good for undercover agent
from Russian intelligence.

689
01:27:22,876 --> 01:27:25,837
I knew about you all along...

690
01:27:26,005 --> 01:27:31,094
and it was my pleasure to twist
you and use you how I saw fit.

691
01:27:32,931 --> 01:27:34,183
And you.

692
01:27:39,146 --> 01:27:41,982
Of all people, I thought
you'd understand...

693
01:27:42,192 --> 01:27:44,569
what I'm trying to accomplish.

694
01:27:45,070 --> 01:27:46,947
Can you imagine?

695
01:27:47,740 --> 01:27:50,785
Imagine a city like
Prague vanishing...

696
01:27:50,953 --> 01:27:53,996
in a cloud of poison gas.

697
01:27:54,165 --> 01:27:57,460
Then Hamburg,
London, Washington.

698
01:27:57,961 --> 01:28:03,342
Imagine not knowing who did it, or
why. And so they turn on each other.

699
01:28:03,634 --> 01:28:07,597
These guys attack those guys.
Those guys invade these guys.

700
01:28:07,806 --> 01:28:10,726
Soon, whole world implodes.

701
01:28:10,936 --> 01:28:14,106
Imagine governments
disappearing.

702
01:28:14,315 --> 01:28:16,150
And in the end...

703
01:28:16,234 --> 01:28:20,822
imagine facing absolute,
beautiful freedom.

704
01:28:25,327 --> 01:28:28,583
But neither of you will
be there to see it.

705
01:28:30,712 --> 01:28:32,754
Like Viktor.

706
01:28:35,675 --> 01:28:37,302
Like Kolya.

707
01:29:23,942 --> 01:29:25,528
Cover me!

708
01:29:35,121 --> 01:29:37,208
Get me out of this thing!

709
01:29:41,379 --> 01:29:44,633
He took the hard drive.
He's going to launch Ahab!

710
01:29:50,724 --> 01:29:52,476
Pick one.

711
01:30:03,239 --> 01:30:04,783
Ivan, take out that nest!

712
01:30:25,726 --> 01:30:27,603
You have to turn the safety off.

713
01:30:51,632 --> 01:30:53,843
Hold them off as
long as you can.

714
01:30:55,553 --> 01:30:57,513
See you, my friend.

715
01:31:54,167 --> 01:31:55,877
Come on, baby.

716
01:32:04,514 --> 01:32:07,475
Stop! He's got us pinned down.

717
01:32:11,397 --> 01:32:12,773
Shit.

718
01:32:13,190 --> 01:32:14,734
You got a bazooka!

719
01:32:14,901 --> 01:32:19,197
Stop thinking Prague police and start
thinking PlayStation. Blow shit up!

720
01:32:19,365 --> 01:32:22,870
This is not bazooka. This
is heat-seeker rocket.

721
01:32:25,456 --> 01:32:26,790
Heat-seeker?

722
01:32:28,293 --> 01:32:29,295
Set it.

723
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:36,259
The son of a bitch is smoking.

724
01:32:53,114 --> 01:32:55,952
I told him that cigarette
would kill him.

725
01:33:56,985 --> 01:33:59,237
Learn how to shoot,
piece of shit!

726
01:34:24,810 --> 01:34:27,229
Quick! Help me pull him out!

727
01:34:31,818 --> 01:34:34,030
It will hit the
city in 30 minutes!

728
01:34:48,632 --> 01:34:51,134
Guys. I need a helicopter.

729
01:34:51,927 --> 01:34:54,222
I need transportation.
I need a...

730
01:35:01,272 --> 01:35:04,900
X, there you are. I gave
you everything you wanted.

731
01:35:05,110 --> 01:35:07,279
This thing will
damn near fly now.

732
01:35:07,404 --> 01:35:10,323
You screwed me. Gibbons
didn't authorize this.

733
01:35:10,491 --> 01:35:12,326
He'll hang us both out to dry.

734
01:35:12,535 --> 01:35:14,329
- Agent Shavers.
- Yeah?

735
01:35:14,663 --> 01:35:17,417
I'm going to give you
a field promotion.

736
01:35:17,624 --> 01:35:21,087
Take over, finish the mop-up.
You're in charge.

737
01:35:21,796 --> 01:35:25,634
Yes, Sir! I'm the man for the
job! I won't let you down!

738
01:35:26,803 --> 01:35:28,555
Wait! Wait! Wait!

739
01:35:29,139 --> 01:35:30,819
Almost forgot the Manual.
You'll need this.

740
01:35:31,018 --> 01:35:33,729
Hey, X. Go kick some ass.

741
01:35:54,670 --> 01:35:58,799
That thing must be going 80 mph!
How do we stop it?!

742
01:35:58,967 --> 01:36:03,013
We can't! The controls
are on the bubble panel.

743
01:36:03,138 --> 01:36:04,848
- You see it?
- Yeah.

744
01:36:05,058 --> 01:36:07,268
The hard drive's in there!

745
01:36:07,436 --> 01:36:11,858
You got the Manual. See if Shavers
put in anything we could use.

746
01:36:11,984 --> 01:36:14,986
- He's got very bad
handwriting. - Come on!

747
01:36:15,321 --> 01:36:20,577
Flame throwers, mini-bombs, exploding
hubcaps, rocket launchers!

748
01:36:21,203 --> 01:36:24,831
This is a tank. You can't
use any of it on Ahab.

749
01:36:24,998 --> 01:36:28,586
Silent Night only breaks
down in deep water.

750
01:36:29,505 --> 01:36:31,633
- I'll have to get on it!
- What?

751
01:36:33,093 --> 01:36:34,928
I'll have to get on it.

752
01:36:42,104 --> 01:36:46,650
Our surveillance puts Ahab 22
minutes outside of Prague.

753
01:36:46,943 --> 01:36:51,615
- We should evacuate the city. -
22 minutes for 1.5 million people?

754
01:36:51,948 --> 01:36:55,578
Call air support. We may need
to blow it out of the water.

755
01:36:55,953 --> 01:36:58,789
- If we hit that thing...
- This city will die.

756
01:36:58,957 --> 01:37:01,085
And the crisis
will be contained!

757
01:37:01,252 --> 01:37:03,045
One city's better than 10.

758
01:37:05,631 --> 01:37:09,219
Another thing: A blue GTO is
traveling parallel to Ahab.

759
01:37:20,734 --> 01:37:23,486
Shit! Does this road
go back to the river?

760
01:37:23,987 --> 01:37:26,282
Come on! Check the GPS!

761
01:37:28,035 --> 01:37:31,497
Yes, it does! Fifteen miles
at the town of Davle!

762
01:37:49,103 --> 01:37:52,106
There's got to be something
here we could use.

763
01:37:52,273 --> 01:37:56,319
Harpoon gun, parachutes built
into seats, ejectable roof.

764
01:37:56,444 --> 01:37:58,614
It's all useless!

765
01:38:00,116 --> 01:38:01,409
How far are we?

766
01:38:03,162 --> 01:38:06,166
The river is just beyond
the next village.

767
01:38:15,301 --> 01:38:18,389
I'm going through! Use
the rocket launcher!

768
01:38:18,596 --> 01:38:20,264
- Twenty-two!
- Hit it!

769
01:38:23,854 --> 01:38:26,357
That was a flamethrower!
Use the rockets!

770
01:38:26,565 --> 01:38:29,695
It's 32! I told you! I told
you he had bad handwriting!

771
01:38:29,861 --> 01:38:31,071
Hit it!

772
01:39:05,487 --> 01:39:09,326
Shavers loaded this thing.
We're missing something.

773
01:39:09,618 --> 01:39:12,496
There are more weapons
here on the back. Look.

774
01:39:23,053 --> 01:39:27,141
- Take the wheel!
- What? You're crazy!

775
01:39:31,853 --> 01:39:33,230
The brake! The brake!

776
01:39:36,193 --> 01:39:37,444
The gas! The gas!

777
01:39:50,586 --> 01:39:52,088
X, what are you doing?

778
01:39:52,962 --> 01:39:54,799
Five minutes to target.

779
01:40:00,307 --> 01:40:02,350
X, talk to me! What
are you doing?

780
01:40:02,685 --> 01:40:05,646
- You said there was an
ejectable roof. - Right here!

781
01:40:05,854 --> 01:40:06,898
Hit it!

782
01:40:21,039 --> 01:40:23,583
Shit! It's out of range!

783
01:40:23,833 --> 01:40:27,213
- There's a bridge! Cross
the bridge! - Okay.

784
01:40:41,982 --> 01:40:43,067
Come on.

785
01:40:46,612 --> 01:40:47,740
Come on!

786
01:40:50,075 --> 01:40:52,452
- Got you!
- Yes!

787
01:40:54,121 --> 01:40:57,166
- I wish I had a camera!
- What you talking about?

788
01:40:57,292 --> 01:40:59,837
This is gonna be one
hell of a trick.

789
01:41:55,279 --> 01:41:56,990
Three minutes to target.

790
01:43:48,878 --> 01:43:50,506
One minute to target.

791
01:43:51,048 --> 01:43:53,174
Move! Move! Move!

792
01:43:54,136 --> 01:43:55,636
Out of the way!

793
01:44:14,701 --> 01:44:15,953
Eyes!

794
01:44:32,849 --> 01:44:34,642
Ten seconds to target.

795
01:44:43,652 --> 01:44:45,154
Target in sight.

796
01:44:45,531 --> 01:44:49,368
Call the jets off. Tell
the jets to stand down!

797
01:45:02,259 --> 01:45:04,720
Welcome to the Xander zone!

798
01:45:45,103 --> 01:45:50,359
Zero contamination level. I understand,
Sir. Zero contamination level.

799
01:46:01,915 --> 01:46:03,041
You Yelena?

800
01:46:04,461 --> 01:46:06,129
Mr. Gibbons.

801
01:46:07,005 --> 01:46:09,716
I promised Xander you
could go to America.

802
01:46:10,341 --> 01:46:12,178
I'm a man of my word.

803
01:46:12,303 --> 01:46:15,264
It doesn't make much
difference now, does it?

804
01:46:41,215 --> 01:46:44,427
He's alive! He's alive!
Come here!

805
01:46:51,519 --> 01:46:55,565
Get him out of there,
double-time. Go! Move!

806
01:46:57,776 --> 01:47:00,778
- Bora Bora!
- What? I can't hear you!

807
01:47:04,284 --> 01:47:05,868
Bora Bora.

808
01:47:31,650 --> 01:47:32,901
You're getting burnt.

809
01:47:38,493 --> 01:47:40,370
Xander, you there?

810
01:47:40,996 --> 01:47:44,876
I know you're there, Xander. I've got
you here on satellite magnification.

811
01:47:49,213 --> 01:47:52,719
Call me. We got a whole
new thing to talk about.

812
01:47:53,844 --> 01:47:56,055
Something very
important has come up.

813
01:47:57,057 --> 01:47:58,600
Oh, by the way...

814
01:47:59,058 --> 01:48:02,105
you passed the test.
The Gibbons test.

815
01:48:05,150 --> 01:48:07,278
You gotta be kidding me.
