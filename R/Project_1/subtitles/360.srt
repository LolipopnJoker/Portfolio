2
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,100
Once upon a time...

3
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,058
in a happy forest,
in the happiest tree...

4
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,698
lived the happiest creatures
the world has ever known.

5
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,860
The Trolls.

6
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,332
They loved nothing more

7
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,888
than to sing,
and dance, and hug.

8
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,574
Dance, and hug,
and sing, and dance,

9
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,900
and sing, and hug,
and dance...

10
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,036
and hug, and dance,
and sing, and hug,

11
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,060
and dance, and hug...

12
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,773
But then one day,

13
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,418
the Trolls
were discovered by...

14
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,053
a Bergen!

15
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,172
The Bergens
didn't know how to sing...

16
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,932
or dance...

17
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,618
or even hug.

18
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,699
They were the most miserable
creatures in all the land.

19
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,095
And once they saw
how happy the Trolls were...

20
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,860
they wanted some of that
happiness for themselves.

21
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,896
Oh, my God!

22
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,973
Eating a Troll made
them feel so happy...

23
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,051
they started a tradition.

24
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,290
Once a year, every year...

25
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,815
the Bergens would gather
around the Troll Tree...

26
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,811
to taste happiness...

27
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,972
on a holiday they called...

28
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,289
Trollstice.

29
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,740
Whoo!

30
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,618
Good morning, Daddy!

31
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,340
Daddy, wake up!

32
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,253
Daddy, wake up!
Wake up! Wake up, Daddy!

33
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,295
Wake up, Daddy.

34
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,610
Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy! Daddy!

35
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,815
Daddy, wake up!

36
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,331
Gristle! What time is it?

37
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,936
It's Trollstice!

38
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,014
Trollstice!
Our one day to be happy.

39
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,180
Yeah!

40
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,649
Trolls! Trolls! Trolls!

41
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,091
Trolls! Trolls! Trolls!

42
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,134
Please give it up for
your Keeper of the Trolls...

43
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,456
your Minister of Happiness...

44
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,019
your Royal Chef...

45
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,220
Me.

46
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,380
Ooh!

47
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,378
This is a very special Trollstice...

48
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:14,135
as there is one amongst us
who has never tasted a Troll.

49
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,609
Ooh, me!
She is talking about me!

50
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,617
Prince Gristle...

51
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,537
...the time has come.

52
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,740
It's okay, son.

53
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,210
I remember being nervous
my first time.

54
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,495
Okay.

55
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,651
That's my boy.

56
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,220
It is my sacred duty...

57
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:37,339
to initiate you in the
ways of true happiness.

58
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,499
I have chosen an extra-special
Troll, just for you.

59
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,376
The happiest,
the most positive...

60
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,738
sweetest Troll of all.

61
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,738
And because every prince
deserves a princess...

62
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,853
I give you the one
they call Princess Poppy.

63
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,571
Please make me happy,
Princess Poppy.

64
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,849
What are you feeling?

65
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,895
That one's rotten!

66
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,014
It's fake?

67
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,091
Fake?
Fake?

68
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,249
They're gone?

69
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,372
Where are they?

70
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,770
Don't worry, sire.
We'll find them.

71
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,132
I think I hear something!

72
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,133
Go! Go!

73
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,980
We got Poppy!

74
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,436
Pass her to me!
Here comes Poppy!

75
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,609
Here she is!

76
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,778
Ah! There's my princess.

77
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,049
Da-da.

78
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,894
King Peppy, some of the others
can't keep up.

79
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,415
No Troll left behind!

80
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,289
Thank you, King Peppy!

81
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,956
- Thank you, King Peppy!
- Thank you!

82
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,295
Thank you, King Peppy.

83
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,657
No Troll left behind!

84
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,139
Daddy, where are they?

85
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,412
Don't just stand there!
Make my son happy!

86
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,571
He will be happy!

87
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,408
Where is he?

88
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,534
I don't think
King Peppy made it.

89
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,938
When I say
no Troll left behind...

90
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:45,009
I mean,
no Troll left behind!

91
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,499
King Peppy,
where's Princess Poppy?

92
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,776
Don't worry. She's safe.

93
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,374
No Troll left behind!

94
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,779
Aww!

95
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,900
But we'll be a lot safer

96
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,196
the further we get
from Bergen Town.

97
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,131
Go, go! Hurry!

98
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,333
That's right! Take her away!

99
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,138
Get her out of my sight!

100
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:12,055
She is hereby banished
from Bergen Town forever.

101
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,810
We can all be happy again.

102
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,857
I'll find the Trolls!

103
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,699
And shove them down
your ungrateful throats.

104
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,257
But, Daddy...

105
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,254
I never got to eat a Troll.

106
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,813
What's gonna
make me happy now?

107
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,060
Come here, son.

108
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,929
Nothing.

109
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,092
Absolutely nothing.

110
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:54,617
You will never, ever, ever,
ever be happy.

111
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,449
Never?

112
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,260
Ever.

113
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,453
Here! Right here!

114
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,454
This is where we will
rebuild our civilization.

115
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,453
It has everything we need.

116
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,088
Fresh air,
clean water...

117
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,615
and sweet acoustics.

118
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:36,416
Ba de ya
Say do you remember

119
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,295
Ba de ya
Dancing in September

120
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,812
Ba de ya
Never was a cloudy day

121
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,415
Twenty years ago today,
King Peppy made us safe...

122
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,729
and now every Troll is free

123
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,617
to be happy
and live in perfect...

124
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,498
Harmony
Harmony

125
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,013
Harmony

126
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,296
And that's why
we hug every hour.

127
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,380
Yep.

128
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,257
I wish it was
every half hour.

129
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,420
So do I.

130
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,636
But that wouldn't leave
much time

131
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,140
for singing and dancing,
now would it?

132
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,451
Princess Poppy, do the Bergens
still want to eat us?

133
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,417
You bet!

134
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,173
But just because it's the only
way they'll ever be happy.

135
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:18,252
Oh, no.
I do taste delicious.

136
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,537
Isn't there anything else
to make them happy?

137
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,452
Ooh. What about
having birthday parties?

138
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,939
Or slumber parties?

139
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,172
Or staring at your parents
while they sleep.

140
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,012
But I don't want
to be food.

141
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,939
Don't worry.
No Troll ever will be.

142
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,619
And that's why
we're celebrating

143
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,691
with the biggest party ever.

144
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,816
Everybody's gonna be there.

145
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,772
Everybody?

146
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,455
Everybody.

147
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:52,896
<i>Everybody, move
your hair and feel united</i>

148
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,738
<i>Ohh!</i>

149
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:00,851
<i>Everybody, shake your
hair and feel united</i>

150
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,853
<i>Ohh!</i>

151
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,540
<i>Yeah</i>

152
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,836
<i>Everybody's coming
to the celebration</i>

153
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,976
<i>I'ma hook you up
with the invitation</i>

154
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,812
<i>Let your hair swing
and party with me</i>

155
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,572
<i>No bad vibes
Just love, you'll see</i>

156
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,814
<i>Do the D-A-N-C-E
One-two-three-four fight</i>

157
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,733
<i>Stick to the B-E-A-T
Get ready to</i>

158
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,900
<i>Ignite</i>

159
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,013
<i>You are such a P-Y-T
Catching all the lights</i>

160
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,729
<i>Just easy as A-B-C
That's how you make it right</i>

161
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,900
<i>It ain 't hard out here
When you're doing it right</i>

162
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,249
<i>Put a smile on blast
That's the Troll life</i>

163
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,092
<i>And I'm here
to help you through it</i>

164
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,415
<i>Come on, Smidge,
I know you can do it</i>

165
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,088
Your confidence
gives me strength.

166
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,298
Okay, Mr. Dinkles.

167
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,098
Say, leaves!

168
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,413
Mmm.
Something's missing.

169
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,900
That's it!

170
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,516
<i>Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop the beat</i>

171
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,292
<i>I can't stop, can't stop
Can't stop the beat</i>

172
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,212
<i>I won't stop, won't stop
Won't stop the beat</i>

173
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,415
<i>Go!</i>

174
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:15,811
<i>Everybody, shake your
hair and feel united</i>

175
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,812
<i>Ohh!</i>

176
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,654
<i>Sunshine day,
everybody's singing</i>

177
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,139
<i>Sunshine day</i>

178
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:28,135
<i>Everybody, move your
hair and feel united</i>

179
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,493
<i>Ohh! Yeah, ohh!</i>

180
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,175
<i>Yeah!</i>

181
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,814
Unbelievable, guys.

182
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,931
Really, really great.
Good job.

183
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,011
I could hear you
from a mile away!

184
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,296
Good. I was worried we weren't
projecting enough.

185
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:58,339
Poppy, if I can hear you,
so can the Bergens.

186
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,500
Oh, boy.

187
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,979
Here we go again.
Oh, Branch...

188
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,334
You always ruin everything.

189
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,979
Warning us
about the Bergens.

190
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,540
No, I don't.

191
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,690
The Bergens are coming!

192
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,851
The Bergens are coming!

193
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,851
The Bergens are coming!

194
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,009
Come on! We haven't seen
a Bergen in 20 years.

195
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,369
They're not gonna find us.

196
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,292
No, they're not
going to find me,

197
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,060
because I'll be
in my highly camouflaged...

198
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,859
heavily fortified,
Bergen-proof survival bunker.

199
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,836
You mean you're not coming
to the party tonight?

200
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,460
But it's going to be
the biggest...

201
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,540
The loudest...

202
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,451
The craziest party ever!

203
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,691
Big?
Loud?

204
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,900
Crazy?

205
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,176
You're just gonna lead
the Bergens right to us!

206
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,058
Are you sure
you wanna invite

207
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,011
this party pooper
to poop on your party?

208
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,899
Yes. I think everyone deserves
to be happy.

209
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,334
I don't do happy.

210
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,179
Branch, I know you have
happiness inside you.

211
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,410
You just need
our help to find it.

212
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,050
Celebrate
freedom from the Bergens

213
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,851
What do you say, Branch?

214
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,572
Oh, my God.

215
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,095
I wouldn't be caught dead at
your party, but you will be.

216
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,773
Caught and dead.

217
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,009
Whoa, whoa.

218
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,091
Easy, Branch. Easy.

219
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,054
Thank you for providing
safe passage, brother.

220
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,619
Namaste.

221
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,533
Okay, first of all, mate,
thanks for sharing

222
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,451
your unique perspective
on things.

223
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,620
Again.

224
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,356
But, just for now,
why don't you try on

225
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,733
some positivity, eh?

226
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,573
A little positivity
might go with that vest.

227
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,929
Okay, fine.

228
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,137
I'm positive you all
are going to get eaten.

229
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,531
Hug time!
It is hug time.

230
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,611
Hug time!

231
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,740
Oh, that feels good.
Our hearts are synchronizing!

232
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,130
I can squeeze you forever

233
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,736
Someday,
when the Bergens find us...

234
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,414
and the survival of every
Troll is in your hands...

235
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,729
I sure hope the answer

236
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,180
is singing, dancing,
and hugging...

237
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,812
because that's all you know
how to do.

238
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,131
That is not true!
Poppy can also scrapbook.

239
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,053
I can't believe you're
gonna be queen one day.

240
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,220
Tune out his
negative vibrations, Poppy.

241
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,489
They're toxic.

242
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,777
Some folks just
don't want to be happy.

243
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,055
I guess.

244
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,375
You guessed right.

245
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,815
Boop.

246
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,093
Yeah!

247
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,331
Whoo! I love you so much!

248
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,780
Yeah!

249
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,818
Whoo! Glitter!

250
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,812
YOLO!

251
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,214
More glitter!

252
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,293
Turn it up!

253
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,528
I can't hear you!

254
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,412
Trolls.

255
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,253
Okay, everyone.

256
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,411
I just want to
take a moment...

257
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,172
and get a little real.

258
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,340
Poppy!

259
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,092
She's my friend!
I know her!

260
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:02,416
I'd like to take a second
to celebrate our king...

261
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,500
my father...

262
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,775
who, 20 years ago
this night...

263
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,693
saved all of us
from those dreaded...

264
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,448
Bergens.

265
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,775
Gotcha.

266
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,533
Uh...

267
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,735
Cupcake?

268
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,491
Run!

269
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,580
Run! Run!

270
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,380
Poppy, help!

271
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,980
Mr. Dinkles?

272
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,051
Has anybody seen
Mr. Dinkles?

273
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,971
Biggie!

274
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:48,132
Blend in! Blend in!
Blend in!

275
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,460
Poppy!

276
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,491
Run!

277
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,615
Run, Smidge!

278
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,700
Oh, my God!

279
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,900
Poppy, help!

280
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,208
Hurry!

281
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,972
Go! Go! Go!

282
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,689
Phew... Whoa!

283
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,820
Cooper!

284
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,657
Everyone,
minimize your auras!

285
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,333
Creek!
No! Poppy!

286
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,654
Hold on.
Poppy!

287
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,333
No!
Creek!

288
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,933
Ow!

289
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,213
Hmm.

290
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,137
Bad Bergen!
Bad, bad Bergen.

291
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,255
Ah...

292
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,978
Bad, bad Bergen!

293
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,060
Dad!

294
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,171
Whoa...

295
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,413
Thanks for throwing
the biggest...

296
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,536
the loudest...

297
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,770
The craziest party ever.

298
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,777
Is it coming back?

299
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,090
What are we gonna do now?

300
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,860
We have to find a new home.

301
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,140
Everyone, hurry.

302
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,450
We have to leave before
the Bergens come back.

303
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,735
We have to rescue them.

304
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,419
No, Poppy,
we have to run.

305
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,098
Now, let's go, everyone.
Come on!

306
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,457
What about
"No Troll left behind"?

307
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,815
I'm sorry, Poppy.

308
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,254
That was a long time ago.

309
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,894
And I'm not the king
I once was.

310
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,089
Then I'll go.

311
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,773
I'll go and save them.

312
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,454
No, Poppy.
It's too dangerous.

313
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,053
I have to at least try.

314
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,098
No. You can't go to
Bergen Town by yourself.

315
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,733
It's impossible.

316
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,449
Celebrate freedom from the Bergens

317
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:28,129
Celebrate freedom
from the Bergens

318
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,971
Branch, you're invited!

319
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,334
No! No! No!

320
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,653
Branch! Branch! Branch!

321
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,299
Branch, are you
in there? Huh?

322
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,979
I'm not going to your party.

323
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,175
The party's over.

324
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,932
We just got
attacked by a Bergen.

325
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,294
I knew it.

326
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,180
Branch!
Shh.

327
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,139
I have to tell you something.
Shh.

328
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,780
I was just gonna...

329
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,691
Shh! Shh!

330
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,380
What?

331
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,116
What could be
so important that it's worth

332
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,539
leading the Bergen
right to us?

333
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,780
The Bergen's gone!

334
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,780
You don't know that.
It could still be out there.

335
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,900
Watching.

336
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,020
Waiting.

337
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,818
Listening.

338
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,335
No. It left!

339
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,008
It took Cooper, and Smidge,
and Fuzzbert...

340
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,898
and Satin,
and Chenille, and Biggie,

341
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,976
and Guy Diamond,
and Creek!

342
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,129
Mmm.

343
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,733
Which is why
I have to ask you.

344
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,780
Will you go to Bergen Town
with me and save everyone?

345
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,054
What? No.

346
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,251
Branch, you can't say no.
They're your friends.

347
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,052
Uh-uh-uh.
They're your friends.

348
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,156
I'm staying right here
in my bunker where it's safe.

349
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,215
Oh, that's great.

350
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,476
You're the one guy who knows
more about Bergens than anyone...

351
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,620
but when
we finally need you,

352
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,059
you just want
to hide here forever?

353
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,654
Forever? Pfft. No.

354
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,008
Oh!

355
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,580
Yeah...

356
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,836
I really only have
enough supplies

357
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,010
down here
to last me 10 years...

358
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,740
11 if I'm willing to store
and drink my own sweat.

359
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,379
Which I am.

360
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,172
You all said
I was crazy, huh?

361
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,217
Well, who's crazy now?

362
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,935
Me. Crazy prepared.

363
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,731
I'm sorry.
I should have listened to you.

364
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,538
You told me
not to throw the party,

365
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,053
and I threw it anyway.

366
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,580
And it's my fault
they were taken.

367
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,253
And now
I don't know what to do.

368
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,889
Why don't you try
scrapbooking them to freedom?

369
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,293
Solid burn, Branch.

370
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,409
Well, thanks anyway.

371
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,730
Hey, anytime, Poppy.
See you in 10 years.

372
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,934
Oh, hey, Branch?

373
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,250
Just wondering
if I could borrow something.

374
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,380
What?

375
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,813
Your bunker.
What?

376
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,050
Okay, everybody.
Come on in!

377
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,455
Hi, Branch!

378
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,973
No! No! No!

379
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,136
Whoa, wait!
Poppy, what are you doing?

380
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,596
You said
you have enough provisions

381
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,133
to last 10 years, right?

382
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,450
Yes, to last me
10 years. Me!

383
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,769
It'll last them two weeks!

384
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,493
Then I guess I better hurry.

385
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,660
Wait, wait, wait!

386
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,293
You won't last a day
out there.

387
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,416
And you won't last a day
in here.

388
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,933
Chug, chug, chug!

389
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,815
Solid burn, returned.

390
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,618
Sorry, Branch!

391
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,499
Uh, Poppy, wait.

392
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,333
Please be careful.

393
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,612
Don't worry, Dad.
I can do this.

394
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,811
I love you, Poppy.

395
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,537
I love you too, Dad.

396
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,535
They grow up so fast.

397
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,772
Bye, everybody!
See you soon!

398
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,175
Good luck,
Princess Poppy!

399
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,010
And three, two, one.

400
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,500
Hug time!

401
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,849
No.

402
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,476
Hug time! Hug time! Hug time!

403
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,491
No! No!

404
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,891
With her friends
safely hidden...

405
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,699
Princess Poppy set off
to rescue her other friends...

406
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:21,011
confident she'd make it
to Bergen Town on her own.

407
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,370
Convinced she'd make it
to Bergen Town.

408
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,533
Um...

409
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:36,371
Totally sure she'd make it
to Bergen Town.

410
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,094
Mmm...

411
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,054
<i>I really hope
I can do it</i>

412
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,893
<i>'Cause they're
all depending on me</i>

413
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:58,096
<i>I know that I must leave
the only home I've ever known</i>

414
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,376
<i>And brave
the dangers of the forest</i>

415
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:03,293
<i>Saving them
before they're eaten</i>

416
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:09,413
<i>I mean,
how hard can that be?</i>

417
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,771
<i>Looking up at a sunny sky</i>

418
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,135
<i>So shiny and blue
and there's a butterfly</i>

419
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,098
<i>Well, isn't that
a super fantastic sign?</i>

420
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:37,417
<i>It's gonna
be a fantastic day</i>

421
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,576
<i>Such marvelousness
it's gonna bring</i>

422
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,935
<i>Got a pocket full of songs
that I'm gonna sing</i>

423
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,898
<i>And I'm ready
to take on anything</i>

424
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,573
<i>Hooray!</i>

425
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:51,256
<i>Some super fun surprise
around each corner</i>

426
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:54,298
<i>Just riding on a rainbow</i>

427
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,735
<i>I'm gonna be okay</i>

428
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,334
<i>Hey! I'm not
giving up today</i>

429
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,052
<i>There's nothing
getting in my way</i>

430
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,138
<i>And if you knock,
knock me over</i>

431
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,449
<i>I will get back up again</i>

432
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,858
<i>Oh! If something goes
a little wrong</i>

433
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,056
<i>Well you can go ahead
and bring it on</i>

434
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,699
<i>'Cause if you knock,
knock me over</i>

435
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,613
<i>I will get back up again</i>

436
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,619
<i>Whoa, oh, oh, oh</i>

437
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,815
<i>Oh, get back up again</i>

438
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,700
<i>Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

439
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,969
<i>Ahh!</i>

440
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,091
<i>I'm marching along
I've got confidence</i>

441
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,370
<i>I'm cooler than
a pack of peppermints</i>

442
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,974
<i>And I haven't been
this excited</i>

443
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,489
<i>Since I can't remember when</i>

444
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:40,131
<i>I'm off
on this remarkable adventure</i>

445
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,768
<i>Just riding on a rainbow</i>

446
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,175
<i>But what if
it's all a big mistake?</i>

447
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,854
<i>What if
it's more than I can take?</i>

448
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,612
<i>No, I can't think that way</i>

449
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:53,859
<i>'Cause I know that I'm really,
really, really gonna be okay</i>

450
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,137
<i>Hey! I'm not
giving up today</i>

451
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,689
<i>There's nothing getting
in my way</i>

452
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,996
<i>And if you knock,
knock me over</i>

453
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:04,012
<i>I will get back up again</i>

454
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,812
<i>Oh, if something goes
a little wrong</i>

455
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,016
<i>Well you can go ahead
and bring it on</i>

456
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,852
<i>'Cause if you knock,
knock me over</i>

457
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,932
<i>I will get back up again</i>

458
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,688
<i>Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

459
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,219
<i>Oh, get back up again</i>

460
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,250
<i>Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

461
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,380
<i>Oh</i>

462
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,371
<i>I'm okay!</i>

463
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,570
<i>Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

464
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,700
<i>Oh</i>

465
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,036
<i>And if you knock,
knock me over</i>

466
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,334
<i>You knock, knock me over</i>

467
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:35,051
<i>I will get back up again</i>

468
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,260
Hmm?

469
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,575
Get back!

470
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,980
Whoa.

471
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,931
Huh?

472
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,172
Oh no! Poppy?

473
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,500
Hang on!

474
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,771
Get back up again

475
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,134
Branch, my man!

476
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,300
You are right on time.

477
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,451
Oh, right.
Like you knew I was coming.

478
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,236
Yes! I figured after
the third hug time...

479
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,076
getting eaten by a Bergen
wouldn't seem so bad.

480
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,819
And I figured there was no way
you could do this by yourself.

481
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,015
Guess we were both right.

482
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,335
Hmm. All right.
Let's do this!

483
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,636
Sooner we get to Bergen Town,

484
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,940
sooner we can rescue
everybody...

485
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,129
and make it home safely.

486
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,217
Wait, wait, wait.
What's your plan?

487
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,636
I just told you.
To rescue everyone

488
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,660
and make it home safely.

489
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,209
Okay. That's not a plan.
That's a wish list.

490
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,450
Oh! I suppose
you have a plan.

491
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,054
First...

492
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,836
we get to
the edge of Bergen Town

493
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,373
without being spotted.

494
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,893
Then, we get inside
by sneaking

495
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,276
through the old
escape tunnels...

496
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,211
which will then lead us
to the Troll Tree...

497
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,460
right before we get caught,

498
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,979
and suffer
a miserable death...

499
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,734
at the hands of a horrible,
bloodthirsty Bergen!

500
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,175
Hold on a second,
are you scrapbooking my plan?

501
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,695
Uh-huh. Yeah. Almost...

502
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,860
done!

503
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,854
We did it!

504
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,213
There will be no more...

505
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,408
scrapbooking.

506
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,853
Do you have to sing?

507
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,716
I always sing
when I'm in a good mood.

508
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,340
Do you
have to be in a good mood?

509
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,380
Why wouldn't I be?

510
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:13,054
By this time tomorrow,
I'll be with all my friends!

511
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,370
Oh, I wonder
what they're doing right now.

512
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,939
Probably being digested.

513
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,897
They're alive, Branch.
I know it!

514
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,413
You don't know
anything, Poppy.

515
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,356
And I can't wait to see
the look on your face...

516
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,449
when you realize the world

517
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,178
isn't all cupcakes
and rainbows.

518
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,260
'Cause it isn't.

519
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,253
Bad things happen...

520
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,888
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

521
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,613
Hey, I know it's not
all cupcakes and rainbows.

522
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,140
But I'd rather go through life
thinking that it mostly is...

523
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,539
instead of being like you.

524
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,213
You don't sing,
you don't dance.

525
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:43,258
So grey all the time!
What happened to you?

526
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,380
Shh.

527
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,255
A Bergen?

528
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,895
Maybe.

529
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,419
There's no Bergen,
is there?

530
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,890
You just said that
so I'd stop talking.

531
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,540
Maybe.

532
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,617
So special.

533
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,494
Good night, Cooper.

534
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,613
Good night, Smidge.
Good night, Fuzzbert.

535
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,816
Good night, Satin.
Good night, Chenille.

536
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,488
Good night, Biggie.
Good night, DJ.

537
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,013
Good night, Guy Diamond.

538
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,971
Good night, Creek.

539
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,460
Boop.

540
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,973
And good night, Poppy.

541
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,657
Don't even think about it.

542
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:06,333
Stars shining
bright above you

543
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,491
Really? Seriously?
More singing?

544
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,493
Yes, seriously!
Singing helps me relax.

545
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,979
Maybe you ought to try it.

546
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,415
I don't sing,
and I don't relax.

547
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,331
This is the way I am,
and I like it.

548
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,695
I also like a little silence.

549
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:32,336
Hello Darkness, my old friend

550
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,569
I've come
to talk with you again

551
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,694
Hello.

552
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:41,375
Because a vision
softly creeping

553
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:47,170
Left its seeds
while I was sleeping

554
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:52,858
And the vision
that was planted in my brain

555
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,409
Still remains

556
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:01,059
Within the sound...

557
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,014
of silence

558
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,894
May I?

559
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,175
So one of these tunnels
leads to the Troll Tree.

560
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,300
That's right.

561
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,893
There's so many of them.

562
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,534
I wonder which one.

563
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,133
I don't know.

564
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,451
Choose a hole wisely!

565
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,737
For one will lead
to Bergen Town...

566
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,932
and the others,
to certain death.

567
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,100
Who said that?

568
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,775
It was...

569
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,580
me.

570
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:50,896
Hey, guys, how's it going?
Welcome to the root tunnels.

571
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,260
Uh, I just wanted to warn you.

572
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,416
One of these tunnels leads
to the Troll Tree...

573
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,611
and the others to
certain death,

574
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,934
death, death, death...

575
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,090
Do you think you can tell us
which is the right one?

576
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,329
You bet!

577
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,420
Great!
No, that's okay.

578
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,460
We're fine, thanks!

579
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,636
Branch.

580
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,775
He's trying to help us.

581
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,453
I don't like the looks of him.

582
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,770
I mean,
who wears socks with no shoes?

583
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,330
He seems to know
what he's talking about.

584
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,177
Okay, fine.

585
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,933
Which way do we go?

586
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,620
First, you have to
give me a high five.

587
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,729
Then I'll tell you.

588
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,889
What?

589
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,116
Oh, I love high fives.
I'll do it.

590
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,459
Oh, I know you'll do it.

591
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,260
But will he?

592
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,497
All right, dumpy diapers,
up high!

593
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,974
Nope, I don't do high fives.

594
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,619
Slap it, boss.
Not gonna happen.

595
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,338
Party on the top floor.
Nope.

596
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,819
Little slappy.
Make daddy happy.

597
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,049
That's weird.

598
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,653
Come on,
just one little high five.

599
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,538
Oh, no, thanks. I'm good.

600
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,815
Here, just do this...

601
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,494
But with your hand.

602
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,940
Thank you
for that demonstration.

603
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,016
Really cleared up exactly
what I will not be doing.

604
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:50,011
Branch, it's a high five.

605
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,733
The others
lead to certain death.

606
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,299
Get perspective.

607
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,655
One high five
and then you'll tell us

608
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,054
which tunnel to take, right?

609
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,335
So easy.

610
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,819
Okay, fine!

611
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,174
Ooh. Too slow.

612
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,489
Too slow?

613
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,175
Classic.

614
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,178
No, no. All right.

615
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,490
I'm gonna let you slide
with a fist bump.

616
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,970
Whoo. Shark attack!
Nom-nom-nom-nom. Jellyfish!

617
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,700
Hand sandwich. Turkey.
Snowman. Dolphin.

618
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,316
Helicopter. Last Supper.
Monkey in a zoo.

619
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,534
What?
Gear shift

620
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,255
Okay, okay, okay.
Now I'm thinking we hug.

621
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,676
That's right.
You better run, Cloud!

622
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,849
Wait!

623
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,476
I'm gonna
tear your little cloud arms...

624
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,013
off your cloud body,

625
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,420
and high five
your face with them!

626
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,538
He's just a cloud!

627
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,676
- Get back here!
- Branch! He can help us!

628
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,735
Come back!

629
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,975
Run, Cloud Guy!

630
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,060
I'm gonna kill you!

631
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,858
Ta-da! We're here!

632
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,060
Phew...

633
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,216
You guys are a lot of fun.
You know, I gotta go.

634
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,972
Got some cloud stuff
to take care of.

635
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,812
Catch you on the way back?

636
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:00,935
Unless...

637
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,018
you die.

638
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,572
The Troll Tree.

639
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,412
Bergen Town.

640
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,650
<i>I ain't happy
I'm feeling glad</i>

641
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:30,211
<i>I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless</i>

642
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:34,259
<i>But not for long
The future is coming on</i>

643
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,253
<i>I ain't happy
I'm feeling glad</i>

644
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:42,096
<i>I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless</i>

645
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:45,855
<i>But not for long
The future is coming on</i>

646
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,932
<i>Is coming on
Is coming on</i>

647
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,455
<i>Coming on
Is coming on</i>

648
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,531
<i>Is coming on
Is coming on</i>

649
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:57,292
Wow! They're as
miserable as you.

650
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:01,455
Which means they haven't
eaten a Troll yet.

651
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,576
Now, come on.
Let's go save our friends.

652
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,695
Your friends.

653
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,975
Our friends.
Don't fight it.

654
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,209
Oh, Barnabus.

655
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:20,131
You're my only friend
in this whole miserable world.

656
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,254
Dad was right.

657
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:28,814
I'll never ever,
never ever, never be happy.

658
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,135
Never.

659
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:35,498
Never say never.

660
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,817
Chad.
Todd.

661
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,092
Chef, where did you come from?

662
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:56,013
My father banished
you 20 years ago.

663
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,420
Have you been standing behind
that plant this whole time?

664
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,257
If only, sire.

665
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,172
No. I've been out
in the wilderness...

666
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,457
thinking of nothing
but how I let you down.

667
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,858
If only there was some way
I could make you feel better.

668
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,020
Well, fat chance!

669
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,454
The only way
I'll ever be happy

670
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,768
is by eating a Troll...

671
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,771
and that ain't gonna happen,
thanks to you.

672
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,216
Ah, but it just might.
Thanks to me.

673
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,371
You found the Trolls.

674
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,894
Whoa.

675
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:38,498
So this means I might
actually get to be happy!

676
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,660
That's right.

677
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,377
Of course, everyone
else in Bergen Town

678
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,138
will still be miserable...

679
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,370
but that's not your concern.

680
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,697
I am their king,
so maybe it kinda is.

681
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:53,055
What exactly
are you proposing?

682
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:56,337
Bringing back Trollstice?
For everyone?

683
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:57,660
Hmm...

684
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:00,049
Yes! That's exactly
what I'm proposing.

685
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,728
Great idea, sire.
Absolutely brilliant.

686
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,889
Aren't you smart?

687
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,060
I guess I am.

688
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:08,411
And I, your loyal Chef,
will be right behind you.

689
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,411
Holding a knife.
What's that?

690
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,332
Holding a knife,
a spoon, a ladle.

691
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,252
I'm your chef, after all!

692
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,058
Yeah, you sure are!

693
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,170
I'm back!

694
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,218
You, scullery maid,
what's your name?

695
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,380
Uh, Bridget.

696
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,260
Congratulations, Idget.
You work for me now.

697
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,756
So you take
those dishes downstairs

698
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,179
and you start scrubbing.

699
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,331
Yes, Chef.
Thank you, Chef.

700
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,531
Shh. Don't cry,
Mr. Dinkles. Shh!

701
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,293
Guys, Mr. Dinkles
is really freaking out!

702
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:49,411
Whoa, whoa! Everyone,
we must all remain calm.

703
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,690
Comb

704
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:52,860
That's right.

705
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,448
A calm Troll
is a tasty Troll.

706
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:00,215
And you are a key ingredient
in my recipe for success.

707
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,420
You see...

708
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:04,293
he who controls the Trolls
controls the Kingdom.

709
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:07,213
And I am that "he!"

710
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,291
You're a dude?

711
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,420
Ahh!

712
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,295
Ooh.

713
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:17,053
By this time tomorrow,
I'll be queen...

714
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,733
and all of Bergen Town
will get

715
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,412
exactly what they deserve.

716
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:23,333
True happiness!

717
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,173
Chad.
Todd.

718
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,698
So where do you think
our friends are?

719
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:53,250
If I had to guess,
I'd say in a Bergen's stomach.

720
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,258
Could you try to be positive?

721
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,291
Just once.
You might like it.

722
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,650
Okay. I'm sure
they're not only alive...

723
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,857
but about to be delivered
to us on a silver platter.

724
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,329
Thank you.
That wasn't so hard, was it?

725
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,769
Branch!

726
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,532
Hug time?
Seriously?

727
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,849
Listen.

728
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,370
This is gonna be
the best Trollstice ever!

729
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,212
Such a great idea I had.

730
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,976
Yes. Tomorrow is
Trollstice, everyone.

731
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,129
And it must be perfect!

732
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,255
Yes, Chef!

733
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:29,696
Feels great to be ordering
everyone around again.

734
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,969
Branch, look!

735
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,140
They're alive?

736
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,814
And on a silver platter, too.
We were both right.

737
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,050
And to mark the occasion,
Your Highness, look.

738
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,688
I found your old Troll bib.

739
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,540
Oh, wow!
I bet you still fit.

740
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,572
Like a glove!

741
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,974
Ahh...

742
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,693
Shh.

743
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,729
Oh, you think that's funny?

744
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,174
We'll see who's laughing

745
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,579
when I bite
your yummy head off.

746
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,890
When I bite all y'alls
yummy heads off.

747
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,580
Wait a minute.

748
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,651
Chef, this isn't
enough yummy heads

749
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,253
to feed all of Bergen Town.

750
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,658
How are we supposed
to have Trollstice

751
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,372
if there's not enough Trolls?

752
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,576
Oh, there's plenty more
where that came from, sire.

753
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,054
Are you sure?

754
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,396
Because I promised
everyone a Troll.

755
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,535
No, no, no, sire!

756
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,093
Everything will be fine.

757
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,773
If I were truly worried...

758
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:19,056
would I be willing
to do this?

759
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,255
Creek!

760
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,088
Oh, my first Troll!

761
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,455
Go on, eat, King Gristle.

762
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:30,578
Enjoy a taste
of true happiness.

763
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,733
Shouldn't we wait
for Trollstice?

764
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,860
Phew.

765
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:43,290
Sire, every day is Trollstice
when you have Trolls.

766
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,973
Yeah, I guess.

767
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,290
But my dad said the first time
should be special.

768
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,580
Well, you're the king now.

769
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,616
Yeah, I am the king.

770
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,716
But I think
I should share this moment

771
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,617
with all the kingdom.

772
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,498
Eat it!

773
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,580
Mmm.

774
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,775
Oh, my God!
No!

775
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:11,940
Yes!

776
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:17,980
Mmm.

777
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,654
Idget, lock these Trolls
in your room

778
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,651
and guard them with your life.

779
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,180
Yes, Chef.

780
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,460
Yes. Yes, I know.

781
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,769
Branch, we have to save him!

782
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,612
Save him from what?
His stomach?

783
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,316
We didn't see him chew.
We didn't see him swallow!

784
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,409
Face it, Poppy.

785
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,996
Sometimes people go
into other people's mouths...

786
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,020
and they don't come out.

787
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,938
If we go after Creek now,
we're going to get eaten.

788
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,534
I'm sorry...

789
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,099
but it's too late for him.

790
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,300
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

791
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:50,980
Huh. Poppy!

792
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:21,051
Scullery maid!

793
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:26,533
Wash these pots
and pans for Trollstice.

794
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,531
The king's inviting everyone.

795
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,053
Except you.

796
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:56,933
I've been alone
with you inside my mind

797
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:03,095
And in my dreams
I've kissed your lips

798
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,619
A thousand times

799
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:12,898
I sometimes see you
pass outside my door

800
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,215
Hello

801
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:22,453
Is it me you're looking for?

802
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:26,530
I can see it in your eyes

803
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,897
I can see it in your smile

804
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,893
You're all I've ever wanted

805
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,449
And my arms are open wide

806
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:40,451
'Cause you know
just what to say

807
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,780
You're all the idiots! I have
to do everything myself.

808
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,731
And you know
just what to do

809
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:45,855
I have to get out of bed,

810
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:47,956
I'm supposed to put my own
clothes on, tie my own shoes.

811
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:49,572
And I want to
tell you so much

812
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:53,938
I love you

813
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:08,578
Oh, she's in love
with the king.

814
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:11,573
What are you talking about?
Bergens don't have feelings.

815
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:13,916
Well, maybe you don't know
everything about the Bergens.

816
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,293
Now let's go.

817
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,612
- Guys!
- Poppy!

818
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:26,977
<i>Celebrate
good times, come on</i>

819
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:29,256
<i>It's a celebration</i>

820
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,654
<i>There's a party
going on right here</i>

821
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:36,698
No! There is not a party
going on right here.

822
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,858
The sooner we get you
guys out of here...

823
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,533
The sooner
we can save Creek!

824
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,213
What?

825
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,369
Hello?

826
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:49,130
Is it me you're looking for?

827
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:50,973
Phew...

828
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,516
I know you're looking for the
cupcakes and rainbows here...

829
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,132
but let's face it,
Creek's been eaten.

830
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,619
They put him in a taco!

831
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,048
It was horrible.

832
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:00,051
Sorry, Poppy.
Creek's gone.

833
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:05,330
Poppy, how could you possibly
think Creek's still alive?

834
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,979
I don't think he's alive.

835
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:09,574
I hope he's alive,
and that's enough.

836
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,049
How do you always look
on the bright side?

837
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:13,892
There is no bright side here.
None!

838
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:15,493
There's always a bright side.

839
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,730
Hey! Where do you think
you're going?

840
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:23,896
Glitter!
No! Get back in your cage!

841
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:27,768
Chef's gonna be so mad!

842
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,260
No!

843
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,498
Bridget, stop!

844
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,218
You're in love
with King Gristle.

845
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:40,332
Um, I don't know
what you're talking about.

846
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,177
Uh, excuse me!

847
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:47,613
That's not mine.

848
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:53,893
What does it matter?

849
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:56,369
It's not like
he even knows I'm alive.

850
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:58,849
Bridget, I can help you!

851
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:00,020
What if there was a way

852
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,579
we could both get
what we want?

853
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,738
You love Gristle, too?

854
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,858
You'd better back off,
girlfriend!

855
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,292
No. Bridget, no.

856
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:15,248
That Troll King Gristle put
in his mouth, that's Creek.

857
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:17,729
And I would do anything
to save him.

858
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:19,614
The only problem is...

859
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,219
we can't get anywhere
near the king

860
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,415
without him eating us.

861
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:27,813
Oh.
But...

862
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:29,379
you can.

863
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:32,812
You can walk right up to him
and tell him how you feel.

864
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,569
As if.

865
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,810
I can't just walk right up
to the king.

866
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,460
His Royal Awesomeness
would never talk

867
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,333
to a scullery maid like me.

868
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,809
What if he didn't know
you were a scullery maid?

869
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,414
What if he thought
you were this total babe?

870
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:48,413
What kind of total babe

871
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,491
would be dressed
like a scullery maid?

872
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:51,729
I smell like gravy.

873
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,413
What if we made you
a new outfit?

874
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,500
I'm thinking...

875
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:55,660
Jumpsuit!

876
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:57,333
What's the point
of a jumping suit

877
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:58,734
if I still have this hair?

878
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:00,020
Oh, we can fix that.

879
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,489
What's the point of
a new outfit and new hair...

880
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:05,254
if I don't even know what
a total babe would ever say?

881
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:06,700
We can help
with that too!

882
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:07,900
Really?

883
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,095
What do you say, Bridget?

884
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:10,613
You get us Creek,

885
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,850
and we'll get you
a date with the king.

886
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,100
Let's do it?

887
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,772
A 5, 6, 7, 8...

888
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,236
When you look in the mirror

889
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:22,488
Let it disappear

890
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:24,855
All your insecurities

891
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:26,020
Wait!

892
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:27,698
Why isn't this one singing?

893
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:29,095
Come on, Branch.

894
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:30,369
Sing with us!

895
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:32,531
Yeah, Branch,
sing with us!

896
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:33,700
Oh, no. That's okay.

897
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:35,532
You don't think
this will work?

898
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:37,691
Oh, no, no. It's not that.
I just don't sing.

899
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:39,339
Branch!
No.

900
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,775
He's right.
This idea is stupid.

901
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:44,175
King Gristle
will never love me.

902
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,736
Come on. Hey, hey.
What's all this?

903
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:50,175
That's right, Bridget.
Just let it all out.

904
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:52,808
Bridget, let it go.
Just have a good cry.

905
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:53,940
Go, girl!

906
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,577
Okay, now bring it back in.

907
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:58,740
Reel it in.

908
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:01,733
Branch, what are you doing?

909
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:03,094
You have to sing!

910
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:04,414
I told you, I don't sing.

911
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:06,571
Well, you have to!
I'm sorry. I can't.

912
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:08,620
No, you can. You just won't.
Fine. I just won't.

913
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:09,740
You have to!
No!

914
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:10,860
Yes!
No!

915
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,379
Why not?
Why won't you sing?

916
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:14,371
Because singing
killed my grandma, okay?

917
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,011
Now, leave me alone.

918
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:24,097
My uncle broke his neck
tap dancing once.

919
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,731
How did singing
kill your grandma?

920
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:34,699
What song was she singing?

921
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:37,373
I was the one singing.

922
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:42,896
And I need you now tonight

923
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:46,370
And I need you
more than ever

924
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:50,055
That day,
I was so lost in song...

925
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,296
I didn't hear my grandma
trying to warn me.

926
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:53,893
Branch! Watch out!

927
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:57,450
And we'll
only be making it right

928
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:59,451
Watch out, Branch!

929
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,256
Grandma!

930
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:20,979
Once upon a time

931
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:22,931
There was light in his life

932
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:26,570
But now there's
only love in the dark

933
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:28,731
Nothing he can say

934
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:34,054
A total
eclipse of the heart

935
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:39,171
I haven't sung a note since.

936
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:44,139
I'm so sorry, Branch.
I had no idea.

937
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:47,178
I just assumed
you had a terrible voice.

938
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:50,969
No, no,
it was like an angel's.

939
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:54,333
At least, that's what
Grandma used to say.

940
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:00,935
Whoa, whoa.

941
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:02,851
What are you doing?
It's not hug time.

942
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:05,488
I just thought
you could use one.

943
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,608
Oh...

944
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,214
Mmm.

945
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:15,815
Okay.
Okay, I'll help.

946
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:18,130
But I'm still not singing.

947
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:21,817
Okay, people.
Hair we go!

948
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:27,010
<i>You</i>

949
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:32,373
<i>You gotta let it show</i>

950
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,219
<i>I'm comin'
Yay!</i>

951
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:39,213
<i>I'm comin'</i>

952
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:40,380
<i>All right</i>

953
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:41,535
<i>Out</i>

954
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:48,016
<i>I'm comin'</i>

955
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:50,208
<i>Out</i>

956
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:52,820
<i>I'm comin'</i>

957
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:55,414
<i>Yo! I'm coming out
like the sun after rain</i>

958
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:56,580
<i>Ready to shine</i>

959
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:57,876
<i>No time to be playin'
Feelin' good</i>

960
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,413
<i>Gonna get get what I,
what I want</i>

961
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:00,734
<i>Gonna show every-everybody</i>

962
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:01,900
<i>How I, how I flaunt</i>

963
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,409
<i>Look at me now,
my confidence is soaring</i>

964
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:06,356
<i>Dudes be impressed with
the points I'm scoring like</i>

965
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:07,415
<i>That ain 't boring</i>

966
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:09,236
<i>And it just don't quit
Watch the king drop his jaw</i>

967
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:10,620
<i>When I'm shaking my hips
I'm saying</i>

968
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:11,729
<i>She's coming out</i>

969
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:12,940
<i>She's comin '</i>

970
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:14,897
<i>It's time to take a stand
Hey!</i>

971
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:17,494
<i>And show the world
that I'm comin ' out</i>

972
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:20,014
<i>She's comin ' out</i>

973
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:26,810
No, no, no!
It's all wrong!

974
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,900
I'm the king who's
bringing back Trollstice.

975
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,459
I need a bib to match.

976
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:31,655
Yes, sire.

977
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:32,796
I look like a child
in this one.

978
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:35,493
Oh, sire! I need something elegant,
sophisticated.

979
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:37,770
You know, a man's bib.

980
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:39,658
Oh, he's so beautiful.

981
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:41,412
And so are you.

982
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:44,180
Oh, he'll know that I'm just
a scullery maid. No, no, no!

983
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,653
I got to get out of here.

984
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:48,812
I'll be right here for you,
Bridget. We all will.

985
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:50,340
You'll tell me
what to say, right?

986
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:53,093
Of course, I will.

987
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:54,613
Just wait until we get inside.

988
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:57,809
Ooh, Sire! I believe
I have the perfect bib!

989
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:00,653
It better be!
Trollstice is tomorrow night.

990
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:03,288
I mean, I look good.
But I have to look great.

991
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:04,575
Right.

992
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:08,089
It's got a wing-dingle on it!

993
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:11,048
Oh, Your Majesty! Look at you!
Such a big, big boy.

994
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:12,494
I love it!

995
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:15,490
I think you look fat.

996
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:16,979
What?

997
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:20,096
P-H, phat.
Then strike that pose.

998
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:21,813
P-h, Phat!

999
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:23,168
Ew...

1000
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:25,497
Hot lunch!

1001
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:28,891
Total honesty
from a total babe.

1002
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:32,571
And who might you be?

1003
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:33,934
Uh...

1004
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:35,248
Your name is, um...

1005
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:37,020
Lady!
Glitter?

1006
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:38,613
Sparkles!
Seriously?

1007
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:39,855
My name is

1008
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:41,811
Lady Glittersparkles,
seriously.

1009
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:45,173
Well, my lady Glittersparkles.

1010
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:47,331
Would you care to join me
for an evening...

1011
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:50,008
at Captain Starfunkle's
Roller Rink and Arcade?

1012
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:51,499
Would I!

1013
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:52,660
Would I?

1014
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:56,488
Yes! You'd be delighted.

1015
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:58,690
Oh, indeed, I would.

1016
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:00,691
When are you gonna
ask him about Creek?

1017
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:02,088
We have to warm him up first.

1018
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,700
Don't you know
anything about romance?

1019
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:05,851
Of course!
I'm passionate about it.

1020
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:08,693
Really? Don't you know
anything about sarcasm?

1021
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:11,055
I think I had a sarcasm once.

1022
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:13,290
And I'll take
one of everything, Bibbly.

1023
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:16,372
Things are gonna get messy.

1024
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:21,211
Enjoy your pizza.
Here's your tokens.

1025
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:26,176
Ooh, so fancy.

1026
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:29,013
Good thing
I brought my appetite.

1027
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,572
You are fantastic!

1028
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:47,216
Bridget! Compliment him back!

1029
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:48,529
I like your back.

1030
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:51,055
No! I meant say something
nice about him.

1031
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:52,573
But I do like his back.

1032
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,413
Huh?
Um...

1033
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:56,732
Poppy, help her.

1034
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:58,814
Your eyes...

1035
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:00,620
They're...

1036
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,099
Ugh... Ooh!

1037
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:03,773
Your ears...

1038
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:05,055
Your eyes...

1039
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:06,619
ears...
Nose!

1040
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:07,780
Skin!
Neck!

1041
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:08,935
Skin, neck, ears, nose...

1042
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:10,580
face, back of your head.
Are you okay?

1043
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:12,014
Your teeth

1044
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:13,329
Teeth.

1045
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:15,576
What's going on?
Are you making fun of me?

1046
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:16,855
Your eyes!

1047
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:18,975
They're like...

1048
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:21,210
two pools, so deep...

1049
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:24,936
I fear if I dive in...

1050
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:27,455
I might never come up for air.

1051
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:30,415
I might never come up for air.

1052
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:33,778
And your smile...

1053
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,971
The sun itself
turns jealous...

1054
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:38,734
and refuses to come out
from behind the clouds...

1055
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:42,376
Knowing it cannot shine
half as bright.

1056
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:45,816
I kinda do have a nice smile,
don't I?

1057
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:48,370
Yes, you do.

1058
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:54,369
I can't believe
I'm about to say this...

1059
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:55,933
Guys, she's going rogue!

1060
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,933
But being here
with you today...

1061
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:03,093
makes me realize that
true happiness is possible.

1062
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:05,614
Whoa.

1063
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:06,815
It is!

1064
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:10,609
True happiness is a lot
closer than you think.

1065
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:13,656
It's right here.

1066
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:16,650
Mmm. That's pretty,
I guess.

1067
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:18,412
What do you think now?

1068
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,411
Creek?

1069
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,092
I knew he was alive!

1070
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:23,859
Mr. Dinkles, he's alive!

1071
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:25,853
Oh, snap!

1072
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:29,179
You just talked!

1073
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,655
I've been savoring this little guy.
Help!

1074
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:35,294
Uh...
Mercy!

1075
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,615
Tell me, my lady,

1076
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,770
will I be seeing you
at the Trollstice feast?

1077
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:41,454
Well, duh. I'll be working.

1078
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:42,780
It!

1079
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:45,374
It. Working it. You know...

1080
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:47,372
workin' it.

1081
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,852
Yeah!
You're not kidding, you will.

1082
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:52,136
Because you're gonna be
there as my plus one.

1083
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:54,370
Really?
Assuming you'll say yes?

1084
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:55,814
Yes!
Yes!

1085
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:56,900
Yes!

1086
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,898
Meantimes, maybe we should
find some other way to...

1087
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:01,539
work up an appetite.

1088
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:04,692
Oh, yeah?
What did you have in mind?

1089
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:10,980
Whoo!

1090
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,728
Ha-ha!

1091
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:23,500
Whoo!

1092
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:24,740
Whoo!

1093
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:31,852
Ah! Mmm.

1094
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:33,900
Whoa.

1095
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:37,859
Ah...

1096
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:58,259
Your Majesty.

1097
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:01,898
You seem to be having...

1098
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,019
fun.

1099
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:05,135
Oh, I am!

1100
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:08,292
Meet the lovely
Lady Glittersparkles.

1101
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:09,620
Hmm.

1102
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:15,452
You remind me of someone.

1103
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:20,893
She's, uh,
gonna be my plus one.

1104
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:22,419
Oh, I see.

1105
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:23,900
For a moment there
I was concerned

1106
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:26,892
you were changing the plan.

1107
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:32,255
Well, this won't be a problem
at all, Your Highness.

1108
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:34,570
I'll just get my worthless
scullery maid to get...

1109
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:36,657
another place setting ready
for the lovely...

1110
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:39,971
Lady Glittersparkles.

1111
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:41,796
Put her place
setting next to mine.

1112
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:44,095
I want her right by my side...

1113
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:46,820
Hey! Lady Glittersparkles?

1114
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:49,332
Lady Glittersparkles!

1115
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,576
I'll see you at Trollstice,
yeah?

1116
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:03,136
I miss you already.

1117
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:04,735
Ow!

1118
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:11,852
I think the king
really likes us.

1119
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:13,339
I know, right?

1120
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,809
That was the greatest day
of my life!

1121
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:17,420
Thanks, Poppy.

1122
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,092
Thanks to all of you!

1123
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:21,534
Even you, I guess.

1124
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:25,116
I just never thought something
like that could happen to me.

1125
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:26,778
And it just did!

1126
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:29,170
I'm so excited
I could just scream.

1127
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,860
Oh, I could scream too!
Creek is alive!

1128
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:36,294
Yay!

1129
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:45,209
Branch, what's wrong?

1130
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:47,530
Nothing. I thought
we were celebrating.

1131
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,053
That's your happy shout?

1132
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:50,619
It's been a while.

1133
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:52,516
Well, you're gonna
have plenty of practice,

1134
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:53,893
because we're gonna
save Creek...

1135
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:56,335
and life will be all
cupcakes and rainbows again.

1136
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:57,500
Up top!

1137
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:58,735
Too slow.

1138
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:00,219
- Yes!
- I knew it!

1139
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:01,380
Okay, everybody...

1140
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:04,048
let's go save Creek.

1141
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:06,138
No! No! You can't leave.

1142
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:09,133
Lady Glittersparkles is gonna be
the king's plus one at dinner.

1143
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:10,716
The dinner
where they're serving Troll?

1144
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:12,696
Yeah, I think we're gonna
have to skip that one.

1145
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:15,658
No! No, you have to help me
be Lady Glittersparkles.

1146
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:16,809
I need you.

1147
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:19,255
You don't wanna pretend to be
someone you're not forever!

1148
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:21,490
Then how about
just for tomorrow?

1149
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:23,173
Bridget,
you don't need us anymore.

1150
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:25,570
You and the king
can make each other happy!

1151
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:26,809
That's impossible!

1152
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:28,931
Only eating a Troll
can make you happy.

1153
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:30,692
Everyone knows that!

1154
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,414
I wish I'd never
gone on this stupid date!

1155
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:36,649
Bridget...

1156
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:40,216
Just go! Get out of my room.
Leave me alone.

1157
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:41,300
Please, listen.

1158
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:42,779
Bridget!

1159
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:44,089
We've gotta go.
Bridget...

1160
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:45,773
What's going on
down there?

1161
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:48,613
Bridget, scrub that dish!

1162
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:51,453
The king's bringing
a plus one.

1163
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:53,178
Yes, Chef.

1164
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:03,097
We can do this, Barnabus.

1165
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:06,775
I just have to lose 30 pounds
in the next eight hours.

1166
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:25,574
There it is!

1167
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:27,093
Oh...

1168
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:32,289
I feel good
I feel good

1169
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:35,572
I feel good

1170
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:38,180
Creek, we'll have you
out of there in a second.

1171
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:40,092
Hurry!
It's stuck!

1172
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:42,900
Run!

1173
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:50,778
I feel love

1174
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:56,170
Hey, guys! Over here!

1175
01:00:57,580 --> 01:00:58,620
Everyone, get in!
Let's go.

1176
01:00:58,780 --> 01:00:59,849
Branch, give him to me.
Go!

1177
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:01,499
Just go!

1178
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:03,009
Everybody hold on!

1179
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:08,531
Hold it steady, guys.

1180
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:12,658
Satin, Chenille,
sharp right!

1181
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:13,820
Let's do it!

1182
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:19,973
Guy Diamond, glitter him!

1183
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:22,017
Eat glitter!

1184
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:23,820
Ha-ha.

1185
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:28,217
Look!

1186
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:29,894
Hold on!

1187
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:34,775
Creek!

1188
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,049
Branch!

1189
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:49,060
We got you!

1190
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:03,015
Gotcha!

1191
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:08,413
Huh?

1192
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:09,899
No!

1193
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:12,011
He can't be gone.

1194
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:14,410
I'm sorry, Poppy.
We're too late.

1195
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:15,540
Actually...

1196
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:18,492
your timing is perfect.

1197
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:27,539
Sorry, but I can't have you
leaving before tomorrow's dinner.

1198
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:29,776
A dinner to which
you are all invited.

1199
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:31,613
And when I say all...

1200
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:34,772
I mean every Troll
in Troll Village.

1201
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:37,249
You'll never find them.
Not where they're hiding.

1202
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:41,453
Oh, you're right.
I couldn't find them.

1203
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:44,418
But I could
with someone they know.

1204
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:46,737
Someone they trust.

1205
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:49,300
Someone...

1206
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:51,739
like this guy.

1207
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:53,856
Creek! You're alive!

1208
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:55,095
He's so cool.

1209
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:56,260
Yes!

1210
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:59,378
He's selling us out!

1211
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:00,700
Branch! Wait!

1212
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:02,890
I'm sure there's
a reasonable explanation.

1213
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:04,299
At least give him a chance.

1214
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:05,979
Thank you, Poppy.

1215
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:08,378
I'm selling you out.

1216
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:12,298
No, stop! No, wait!

1217
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:16,811
You better
explain yourself, Creek!

1218
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:20,334
As I was about to
accept my fate...

1219
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:23,333
I had, what I can
only describe as...

1220
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,968
a spiritual awakening.

1221
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:27,649
I don't wanna die!

1222
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:29,415
Don't eat me.

1223
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:33,334
Eat someone else. Anyone else.
Everyone else. But not me!

1224
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,650
But the king
wants to be happy now.

1225
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:38,937
Wait! Wait!
There must be some other way.

1226
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:41,489
I'll do anything.

1227
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:43,809
Hmm...

1228
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:49,333
No! Creek,
please don't do this.

1229
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:50,615
Believe me...

1230
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:55,296
I wish there was some other
me-not-getting-eaten way.

1231
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,172
But there isn't.

1232
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:01,170
And now I have to live with
this for the rest of my life.

1233
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:04,531
At least you get to die
with a clear conscience.

1234
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:06,692
So, in a way...

1235
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:09,211
you could say...

1236
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:11,211
I'm doing this for you.

1237
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:16,689
Boop!

1238
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:28,215
Listen. It's Poppy's cowbell!

1239
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:30,178
My baby did it!

1240
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:32,058
Poppy did it!

1241
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:33,220
Ha-ha.

1242
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:36,659
Creek?

1243
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:44,729
Uh-oh.

1244
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:55,255
Trollstice!
Trollstice! Trollstice!

1245
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:08,776
Now let's prepare
the main course.

1246
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:11,295
The Trolls!

1247
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:24,460
Poppy?

1248
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:28,728
Poppy! Oh, thank goodness
you're all right.

1249
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:30,697
I'm doing great.

1250
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:32,612
I got everybody
I love thrown in a pot.

1251
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:34,298
Thanks for asking.

1252
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:39,214
Poppy?
Are you being...

1253
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:41,892
sarcastic?

1254
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:43,369
Yes!

1255
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:45,620
Oh, my God!

1256
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:47,733
I'm sorry.

1257
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:50,056
I don't know why
I thought I could save you.

1258
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:55,130
All I wanted to do
was keep everyone safe,

1259
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:56,978
like you did, Dad.

1260
01:05:57,140 --> 01:05:58,732
But I couldn't.

1261
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:00,653
Poppy.

1262
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:05,289
I let everyone down.

1263
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:11,131
But, Poppy...

1264
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:13,651
You were right, Branch.

1265
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:17,173
The world isn't all cupcakes
and rainbows.

1266
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:30,774
Poppy.

1267
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:10,695
<i>You with the sad eyes</i>

1268
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:23,216
<i>Don't be discouraged</i>

1269
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:43,413
<i>Oh, I realize</i>

1270
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:47,499
<i>It's hard to take courage</i>

1271
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:51,611
<i>In a world full of people</i>

1272
01:08:51,780 --> 01:08:54,817
<i>You can lose sight of it all</i>

1273
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:57,289
<i>The darkness inside you</i>

1274
01:08:57,460 --> 01:09:00,975
<i>Can make you feel so small</i>

1275
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:28,816
What are you doing?
The king is waiting.

1276
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:30,060
Get those Trolls out there!

1277
01:09:30,180 --> 01:09:31,180
Sorry, Chef.

1278
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:32,693
Oh, you are sorry.

1279
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:44,810
<i>Show me a smile then</i>

1280
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:49,849
<i>Don't be unhappy,
can't remember when</i>

1281
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:54,658
<i>I last saw you laughing</i>

1282
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:57,653
<i>This world makes you crazy</i>

1283
01:09:58,220 --> 01:10:01,371
<i>And you've taken all
you can bear</i>

1284
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:04,179
<i>Just call me up</i>

1285
01:10:04,340 --> 01:10:07,298
<i>'Cause I will
always be there</i>

1286
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:11,499
<i>And I see your true colors</i>

1287
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:14,333
<i>Shining through</i>

1288
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:18,579
<i>I see your true colors</i>

1289
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:22,972
<i>And that's why I love you</i>

1290
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:30,057
<i>So don't be afraid</i>

1291
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:33,098
<i>To let them show</i>

1292
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:36,730
<i>Your true colors</i>

1293
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:41,934
<i>True colors are beautiful</i>

1294
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:49,329
<i>I see your true colors</i>

1295
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:51,570
<i>Shining through
True colors</i>

1296
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:56,218
<i>I see your true colors</i>

1297
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:59,253
<i>That's why I love you</i>

1298
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:02,099
<i>So don't be afraid</i>

1299
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:05,451
<i>To let them show</i>

1300
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:09,135
<i>Your true colors</i>

1301
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:10,619
<i>True colors</i>

1302
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:16,851
<i>Are beautiful</i>

1303
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:22,259
<i>Like a rainbow</i>

1304
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:25,054
<i>Oh, oh, oh...</i>

1305
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:29,133
<i>Like a rainbow</i>

1306
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:51,775
Thank you!

1307
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:54,416
No. Thank you.

1308
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:55,615
For what?

1309
01:11:55,780 --> 01:11:58,499
For showing me
how to be happy.

1310
01:11:58,660 --> 01:12:01,333
Really? You're finally happy?

1311
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:03,095
Now?

1312
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:05,011
I think so.

1313
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:07,694
Happiness is inside of
all of us, right?

1314
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:10,977
Sometimes, you just need
someone to help you find it.

1315
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:16,332
What's gonna happen now,
Princess Poppy?

1316
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:17,609
I don't know.

1317
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:20,853
But I know
we're not giving up.

1318
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:27,860
No.

1319
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:29,771
This is it, Mr. Dinkles.
This is it.

1320
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:38,295
Poppy!

1321
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:39,380
Bridget?

1322
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:40,836
Trolls! Trolls! Trolls!

1323
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:42,532
What are you doing?

1324
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:43,849
I can't let them eat you.

1325
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:45,135
But...
Come on!

1326
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:46,574
You gotta go!

1327
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:48,896
Hurry! Go, go, go!
Get out of here!

1328
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:50,740
No! Bridget,
if you go in there without us,

1329
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:52,173
you know what they'll do.

1330
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:53,340
I know.

1331
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:54,569
But, Bridget...

1332
01:12:54,820 --> 01:12:55,820
It's okay.

1333
01:12:57,340 --> 01:12:59,058
It's okay,
Poppy.

1334
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:03,452
You showed me what it feels
like to be happy.

1335
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:07,770
I never would have known
if it wasn't for you.

1336
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:12,254
And I love you for that.

1337
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:14,538
I love you too, Bridget.

1338
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:17,059
Bridget!

1339
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:21,376
Go on, now.
You have to hurry!

1340
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:22,575
Come with us.

1341
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:24,332
And make it easier
for them to find you?

1342
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:26,889
No way! You have to go. Now!

1343
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:28,254
Bridget!

1344
01:13:43,540 --> 01:13:44,939
Bye, Poppy.

1345
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:54,368
Trolls! Trolls! Trolls!

1346
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:00,700
Wait!

1347
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:04,056
Chef, shouldn't we wait
for Lady Glittersparkles?

1348
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:07,214
Oh, you are absolutely right.

1349
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:10,258
Now, everyone, there will be
no Trolls until...

1350
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:12,615
the king's plus one
has arrived.

1351
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:14,139
Boo!

1352
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:16,617
We've waited long enough!

1353
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:17,849
Unless...

1354
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:19,214
Unless, what?

1355
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:22,133
Well, unless
she doesn't come at all.

1356
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:23,369
But that's crazy talk.

1357
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:25,855
Who wouldn't
wanna be with you?

1358
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:33,820
Yeah.

1359
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:35,814
Maybe we should start.

1360
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:37,857
Trolls! Trolls! Trolls!

1361
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:39,579
Trolls! Trolls! Trolls!

1362
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:44,292
Trolls! Trolls! Trolls!
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

1363
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:46,411
Go! Come on.
Hurry!

1364
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:47,980
Come on. Everybody, let's go.

1365
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:49,738
No Troll left behind!

1366
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:51,858
Watch your step.

1367
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:00,774
Poppy?

1368
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:05,938
Bridget just ruined her life to save ours.
It's not right!

1369
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:08,614
She deserves to be happy
as much as we do.

1370
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:12,013
They all do!

1371
01:15:13,820 --> 01:15:18,336
All right, everybody.
Who's ready to eat Trolls?

1372
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:20,497
King Gristle...

1373
01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:21,979
there is only one thing

1374
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:23,613
that will
ever make you happy...

1375
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:26,613
and only one Bergen
who can provide it.

1376
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:29,531
Bon appetit!

1377
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:33,010
- They're gone!
- Gone?

1378
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:34,335
They're gone?

1379
01:15:34,420 --> 01:15:35,420
Idget...

1380
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:36,615
what did you do?

1381
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:37,855
You ate them!

1382
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:40,688
You greedy, greedy pig.

1383
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:41,975
No! I...

1384
01:15:42,140 --> 01:15:43,420
She ruined Trollstice!

1385
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:46,251
Guards, lock her up!

1386
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:50,093
Let's get her!

1387
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:28,299
Lady Glittersparkles?

1388
01:16:29,940 --> 01:16:31,009
What?

1389
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:36,011
But how? Why?

1390
01:16:36,180 --> 01:16:37,659
Why did you do this?

1391
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:41,417
Because she didn't think you
would want someone like her.

1392
01:16:41,580 --> 01:16:43,013
I mean, hello?

1393
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:45,450
Is it me you're looking for?

1394
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:47,576
I don't think so.

1395
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:50,696
Guards, finish her!

1396
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:52,736
Oh!
No.

1397
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:54,412
Wait!

1398
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:56,377
King Gristle,
when you were with Bridget,

1399
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:58,291
you were feeling something,
weren't you?

1400
01:16:58,460 --> 01:16:59,734
Yeah, I was.

1401
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:01,378
I just thought
it was too much pizza.

1402
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:02,734
Me, too.

1403
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:06,176
That feeling?
That was happiness.

1404
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:07,375
What?

1405
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:09,928
But you have to eat
a Troll to be happy.

1406
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:11,692
Everyone knows that!

1407
01:17:11,820 --> 01:17:12,820
Don't you?

1408
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:15,972
But King Gristle's never eaten
a Troll in his life, right?

1409
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:17,937
No, I haven't.

1410
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:20,410
Yet, here I am.

1411
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:22,739
My belly empty...

1412
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:25,411
and my heart full.

1413
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:29,380
Don't listen to her!

1414
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:31,492
There's only
one way to be happy.

1415
01:17:31,660 --> 01:17:32,729
My way!

1416
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:35,056
No!
With me in charge...

1417
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:39,251
I'll serve you Troll
every day of the year.

1418
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:42,376
With me as queen...

1419
01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:43,655
all of life will be

1420
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:45,696
a never-ending feast
of happiness!

1421
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:47,695
Come on, eat!

1422
01:17:47,860 --> 01:17:49,009
Eat!

1423
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:53,740
No!

1424
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:56,408
Happiness isn't something
you put inside.

1425
01:17:56,580 --> 01:17:58,298
It's already there.

1426
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:01,975
Sometimes you just need
someone to help you find it.

1427
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:03,459
Can I really be happy?

1428
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:05,417
I want to be happy!
And me!

1429
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:06,615
And what about me?

1430
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:10,411
Do you really think
I can be happy?

1431
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:11,676
Of course!

1432
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:14,379
It's inside you!
It's inside of all of us!

1433
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:16,451
And I don't think it.

1434
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:18,259
I feel it!

1435
