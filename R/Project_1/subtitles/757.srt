1
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,160
She's on her way.

2
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,520
Good morning, Viv.

3
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,080
Hello, Willow. Lovely to see you.

4
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,400
Here she comes!|- Is that the new Louis Vuitton?

5
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,840
I might've known|she'd be the first.

6
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,040
Fabulous bag. She's so chic.

7
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,280
Sorry I'm late. |We had to do a little shopping.

8
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,520
Now that's the way to travel. |I'm so jealous.

9
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,990
Faboo!

10
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,600
Louis Vuitton never looked so good.

11
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,160
Mmm. Tell me the stones|in that collar are not real.

12
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,640
Aren't they gorgeous?|Viv said I had to have it.

13
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,720
- Sorry keep you waiting. |- Armand, it's fine.

14
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,080
A brush and a seaweed wrap,|but I need her by noon.

15
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,560
- We're having lunch with my niece. |- She'll be ready.

16
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,600
I know, sweetheart. I'm going to miss|you, too. You take good care of her.

17
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,400
- No waxing, OK?|- OK, no waxing for her.

18
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,760
I hope she gives me a red bow. |I want to look my best today.

19
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,080
- Bimini has a date with Scooter. |- Nice pedigree.

20
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,950
Please! The dog chases parked cars.

21
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,080
- He's crazier than a Labradoodle. |- I give it a week, tops.

22
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,440
Hey! Talk to the paw. |- Good for you, Bimini.

23
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:21,440
It's not easy to find a mate with|papers. Let alone one you could love.

24
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,040
Me, I'd be happy with|one who's not... fixed.

25
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,840
Down, boy.

26
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,160
All right, what's next?

27
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,040
- What do you think?|- Please. She wears Harry Winston.

28
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,680
Viv?

29
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,030
Fabulous. I'll take two. |You should see Chloe.

30
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,160
I'll need at least two days at corporate|in New York to meet with buyers.

31
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,240
- You have a little beret?|- Perfection.

32
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,000
Who needs sleep? It's Italy.

33
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,070
Preppy little beauty.

34
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,520
- This just came in. |- She's allergic to wool. No.

35
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,160
Love that. |- Oh! Fabulous!

36
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,520
- Viv. |- I love it. And do you love it?

37
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,080
You may have it. |I'll get you anything you want.

38
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,200
Yes, I will. No, not you, Patrick.

39
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,680
Hello, Jackie O.

40
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,520
- Love the smell of dirt in the morning. |- Sam, the garden looks gorgeous.

41
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,000
And I love the new designs|for the waterfall that you did.

42
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,880
- Thank you. |- You're welcome.

43
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,840
For everything. For giving me|a chance to prove myself.

44
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,600
Oh, good job, Papi. Very symmetrical.

45
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,000
"Ciao. Ciao," Papi.

46
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,950
Yes, yes. We did it, Papi. |Yes. Yes!

47
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,160
Go on, take a break, Papi. |You're doing great, buddy.

48
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,120
Hello, beautiful.

49
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,280
You're blocking my sun.

50
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,200
^i¶ Mi corazón, you shine|^imuch brighter than the sun

51
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,320
"¶ Why won't you be my one ¶

52
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,120
- What's that smell?|- Which one?

53
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,120
The sweat of my labor|or the mint patch I rolled in for you?

54
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:38,640
- Neither. |- Then it must be the fertilizer.

55
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,000
Gross! You're covered in it.

56
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,200
Of course. I am a landscaper.

57
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,280
Grasshopper, "mi corazón?"

58
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,960
I caught it myself. Very tasty.

59
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,950
Papi, that's so... disgusting.

60
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,880
I see you're tempted. I'll leave it here|in case you change your mind.

61
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,040
|- Excuse me. We have guests.

62
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,280
Guests? You got guests... OK.

63
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,040
You want to go have a drink later?|There's a great puddle by the garage.

64
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,760
OK, never mind.

65
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,040
Aunt Viv! I'm here!

66
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,960
An hour late, as usual.

67
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,520
Aunt Viv, hello!|-

68
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,080
How do you keep a job?|Oh, that's right, you don't.

69
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,040
Where's Aunt Viv?|Where's Aunt Viv? Chloe, go find her.

70
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,160
- Go on. Go find her. |- Who am I, Lassie?

71
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,160
You're so completely useless.

72
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,200
Of course I understand.

73
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,160
It's just that I'm headed to|Europe to promote my new cosmetic line.

74
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,040
No, this is wonderful news. |It's the best news.

75
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,800
Yes, yes. OK. Wonderful. Bye.

76
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,920
- Is everything OK, Aunt Viv?|- I don't know what I'm going to do.

77
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,200
I am getting on a plane at 4:00,|and I gave the staff the week off...

78
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,760
and Chloe's dog nanny just|had her baby three weeks early.

79
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,960
- You're not taking Chloe with you?|- No, no.

80
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,880
Obviously if it was a vacation,|of course, but this is a business trip.

81
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,000
Four cities in ten days.

82
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,040
She's much too delicate for that kind|of travel. Plus she hates Berlin.

83
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,160
What about a kennel?|- Kennel?

84
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,950
No.

85
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,600
No, no. I could never leave her|in the hands of strangers.

86
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,240
Never in a million years.

87
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,920
But you're not a stranger.

88
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,920
- What?|- What?

89
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,720
Here is Chloe's schedule. |Try to stay to it as much as possible.

90
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,600
I could skip the dog park on Wednesday

91
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,320
because Chloe's friend, Stella,|came down with fleas.

92
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,840
I'm about to entrust you with|my greatest treasure.

93
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,120
Take good care.

94
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,080
I love you, sweetheart.

95
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,320
I love you so much. |Mommy loves you so much.

96
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,920
Bye-bye! Have fun, you two!

97
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,480
OK. Bye!|-

98
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,360
Playdate?

99
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,280
Here you go. Good luck.

100
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,200
Don't worry, Chloe. |Viv will be back before you know it.

101
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,200
Rachel doesn't look so bad.

102
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,120
You don't know the half of it.

103
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,960
They all look so cute|in their little outfits.

104
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,280
You didn't have to dress her. |She's so picky.

105
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,240
- You're talking about a Chihuahua. |- She's not any Chihuahua, Angela.

106
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:49,080
She's a bossy, arrogant, manipulative,|Beverly Hills Chihuahua.

107
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,080
She has no direction. She can't keep|a job. She's never on time.

108
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm going to be late to my appointments.

109
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,120
Don't get me started on her schedule.

110
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,440
Shiatsu massages, doggy birthday|parties, couture fittings.

111
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,080
I have to change|her outfit four times a day.

112
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,840
I mean, look at her.

113
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,560
She's so...

114
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,520
...irresponsible. |... spoiled.

115
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,240
Woof. |-

116
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,000
- I need to cool off. |- Dive in, girl.

117
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Whoa!

118
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,520
Hi, "mami. "

119
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,640
Oh!

120
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,040
Who is that hunk|of Chihuahua over there?

121
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,120
Nice. |- "Mi corazón!"

122
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,000
The gardener.

123
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,440
You are more lovely...

124
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,080
- than the dawn. |- Wow.

125
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,440
^iMi corazón!

126
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,620
^iYou are more lovely... |than the dawn!

127
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:40,160
So embarrassing. Maybe he'll go away.

128
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,320
I only...

129
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,200
Excuse me while I bravely defend|your garden against that dangerous bird.

130
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,080
Hey, bird!

131
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,680
That is one hot dog.

132
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,680
Excuse me. |Coming through. Nice legs.

133
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,400
Mud all over me.

134
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,760
Hey, hey! Excuse me!

135
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,680
Excuse me! Excuse me, "señor?"|Gardener guy?

136
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,240
Your dog is "muy" bad. |"Muy, muy, muy" bad. "Mucho" naughty.

137
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,600
Can you get... your...

138
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,520
...doggie-o out of here?

139
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,480
^iPerdóname, por favor,|but my heart must speak.

140
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,520
I only wish to say...

141
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,600
that if you ever need someone|to lick inside your ears...

142
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,520
or chew the hard to reach places...

143
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,600
or share your slumber in the sun...

144
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,320
I would be most honored|to be that special someone.

145
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,040
- Woof. |- Put your tongue back in your mouth.

146
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,680
Oh. I don't think so, Papi.

147
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,840
You mean, not now.

148
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,040
I mean... not ever.

149
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,360
I see. Of course. Well...

150
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,600
This thing.

151
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,360
Papi!

152
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,160
Duty calls! Please have|a most wonderful day.

153
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,040
Cool. Thanks a lot.

154
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,040
Rachel, wake up. |I've got a mani-pedi at 11:00,

155
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,280
and you have to make my waffles.

156
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,360
Get up!|-

157
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,080
Aunt Viv's.

158
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,320
Hi, Angela. |-

159
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,760
What?

160
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,400
You're a genius.

161
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,600
Yes, I can be ready|in 30 minutes. OK, bye!

162
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,160
Pack your swimsuit, Chloe. |We're going on a trip.

163
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,560
A trip? Ooh, where are we going?

164
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,080
Mexico! Yeah!

165
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,000
I love this town!

166
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,920
- Let's check it out. |- Surfer boys, hi!

167
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,360
Hi.

168
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,520
I love this town!

169
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,440
I could totally live here. |Isn't this great?

170
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm starting to get the feeling|there's no Four Seasons here.

171
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,920
Whoo!

172
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,160
- Third floor, baby. |- Woo!

173
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,200
Hello? Somebody forget something?

174
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,040
I'm walking by myself. |- Chloe!

175
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,760
I'm starving. |What's taking them so long?

176
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,640
Wait. What time are|we supposed to meet the guys?

177
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,680
Right now, at that club.

178
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,160
Wait a minute. I forgot|the name of the club.

179
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,000
- Cayuca Club!|- Right. Cayuca!

180
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,760
Be right back.

181
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,040
- Dinner time!|- Finally.

182
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,040
You should dance with Bryan, Rache.

183
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,880
- I'm gonna dance with him. |- He's cute!

184
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,160
You'd better be making me|either prime rib or reservations.

185
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,600
There you go.

186
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,560
You're joking, right?

187
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,480
I am ready to dance all night!

188
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,120
There's only one thing this is good for.

189
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,320
- Try this on for size. |- Come on, let's go!

190
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,320
Chloe!

191
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,120
That's a bad dog!|That's a very bad dog!

192
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,280
Rachel. What did you do to her?

193
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,600
Nothing! She's faking! Let's go.

194
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,080
- You silly girl. |- She's so cute.

195
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,080
- We should take her with us. |- Yes! Take me out for food.

196
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,520
- I'm not taking the dog dancing. |- Cayuca!

197
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,200
Hey! Wait!

198
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,320
Come back here! Oops.

199
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,320
Just add that to the bill.

200
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,320
Hello?

201
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,360
"Hola" and "adiós. "

202
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,040
You want to dance, Rachel? Let's dance.

203
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,280
OK. Guy with a giant knife. Moving on.

204
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,560
If I wasn't starving,|this might actually be fun.

205
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,560
Oh! There you are.

206
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,440
You are in so much troub...

207
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,680
Put me down! Who are you?

208
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,920
Rachel, help me! Somebody, please. |I'm being dognapped!

209
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,920
Rachel!

210
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,960
- So... good night. |- Seriously?

211
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,000
No kiss?

212
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,080
Chloe!

213
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,000
Chloe, come out.

214
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,720
I'm not kidding. I mean it. Stop hiding.

215
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,800
Chloe?|I'm sorry I gave you dog food.

216
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,990
Chloe?

217
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,120
I'll order you room service|for breakfast in the morning!

218
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,400
- Chloe?|- What's up, love bug?

219
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,720
Chloe's missing.

220
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,640
I don't know where she would go. |She doesn't like to walk anywhere,

221
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,760
- let alone run. |- Well...

222
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,200
- What?|- "Las peleas de perros" were in town.

223
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,840
Dogfights. They're criminals. |Always on the move.

224
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,400
How do I find them?

225
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,120
I have heard rumors.

226
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,960
Mexico City?

227
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,880
Then there's nothing more you can do.

228
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,240
You've done everything you can.

229
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,160
Why don't you go|put your suit on and join us?

230
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,960
I'm going to keep looking for Chloe.

231
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,040
And if I can't find her,|I'm going to Mexico City.

232
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,040
Rache...

233
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,600
Chloe!

234
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,000
Where am I?

235
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,360
You're in the dogfights.

236
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,520
Dogfights? What?

237
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,600
This is outrageous.

238
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:57,640
I was born to shop, not fight. |Unless it's at a sales rack.

239
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,600
- Quit whining, "princesa. "|- Chloe Winthrop Ashe does not whine.

240
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,240
|A delusional Chihuahua.

241
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,960
You won't get any sympathy from Delgado,|"señorita. " He's a gladiator.

242
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,520
A gladiator?

243
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,440
You know. A fighter. |Delgado is the best of the best.

244
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,160
Don't listen to Rafa, "chica. " El Diablo's|the meanest dog in the fights.

245
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,080
Word is they fought once before,|and Delgado did not come out on top.

246
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,840
What's he saying?

247
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,720
"Ay, bendito," he always|prays before a fight.

248
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,840
Don't you speak any Spanish, "chica?"

249
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:41,840
The name's Chloe, not "chica. "|And why would I speak Spanish?

250
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,480
- Hello! You're a Chihuahua, "mi hija!"|- So?

251
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:49,040
I'm from Beverly Hills. You know, 90210,|the shopping capital of the world?

252
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,280
She's a "gringa" from California.

253
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,680
That's right. The only reason|I'm here is because I was stolen.

254
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,000
You think I volunteered for this?|- But I'm an heiress.

255
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,120
- A hairless?|- No, an heiress.

256
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,360
- I have a trust fund. |- Look.

257
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,100
If you're worth something,|they'll ransom you.

258
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,760
And if they ransom you,|they won't fight you.

259
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:15,080
- Guess you have nothing to worry about. |- Well, that's a relief.

260
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,440
I am so glad you feel better. |Now can we get a little quiet?

261
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,080
I can't wait until Viv finds out|what Rachel's done.

262
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,720
^i¶ Mi corazón,|"I think of you day and night ¶

263
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,760
Hold your tacos.

264
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,600
These scents are old.

265
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,480
Papi? Time to go home!

266
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,880
Where is she? Where is my Chloe?

267
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,000
Whoa!

268
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,320
What's going on?|

269
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,080
Hey, Papi, come on. Let's go.

270
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,920
- Hi. "Hola. "|- Hi.

271
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,880
I'm Rachel's friend, and... |you're the gardener, right?

272
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,000
- I'm Sam. |- Your garden is "muy bonita. "

273
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,960
And when I get a "casa,"|I'm so calling you to be my gardener...

274
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,960
- because it's... |- Thank you very much.

275
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,600
- Where's Rachel?|- Forget her, dude. Where's Chloe?

276
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,280
And what are you hiding there?

277
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,120
Chloe's lost in Mexico. |Rachel stayed to find her.

278
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,800
The love of my life|is out there in trouble?

279
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,920
She wants me to e-mail|this to her in Mexico City.

280
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,320
So...

281
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,360
^iSeñoras y señores!

282
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,880
You know him, you love him.

283
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,560
^iEl campeón, El Diablo!

284
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,560
Oh. It's about time someone's|upgrading my accommodations.

285
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,990
And now, the challenger.

286
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,880
Weighing in at a whopping six pounds.

287
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,600
I give you Chi-Chihuahua!

288
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,160
Hey!

289
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,320
Thank you.

290
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,640
Thank you. You're too kind, really.

291
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,320
This is so much nicer|than that stinky corral.

292
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,640
Oh! I'm sorry. |I thought I was alone.

293
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,760
- Mister... |- They call me El Diablo.

294
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,320
It's certainly nice to meet you. |Clearly I'm in the wrong place.

295
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,120
So perhaps we could|speak to the concierge or someone.

296
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,200
Stop talking!

297
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,280
You know, I've got a dentist who could|do something about that yellowing.

298
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,990
- What?|- I get the idea that teeth...

299
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:56,320
- are important in your line of work. |- You don't like my smile?

300
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,960
|- Watch it! Say it, don't spray it!

301
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,640
What am I going to do?|- Sounds like he's closing in.

302
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,840
Dog that size?|Won't be much left of her.

303
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,120
"Gringa, gringa. "

304
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,080
She's "adiós. " She's bye-bye.

305
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,040
Poor little hairless.

306
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,320
OK, that's it.

307
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,760
Delgado? What are you doing?

308
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,000
Huh?

309
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,360
- What's going on?|- Where are you going?

310
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,160
- How do you do that?|- Bro, give me the combination!

311
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,120
- Yeah, save us!|- Save us, Delgado!

312
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,720
- Don't leave us!|- Come back!

313
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,240
This is highly inappropriate. |Hey, hey, hey! That's cashmere!

314
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,040
Ow!

315
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,560
- "Vámonos!"|- "Hasta la" bye-bye!

316
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,640
Let go before it... rips.

317
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,920
I know it's rude to leave early,|but I really must be going now.

318
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,160
The show's over for you, "chica. "

319
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,120
You know, "dog eat dog" is|just an expression!

320
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,160
- Not this time, Diablo!|- Delgado!

321
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,840
- Move it!|- OK.

322
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,080
You'll pay for this, Delgado!|I'll find you!

323
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,600
Wait, wait!|Slow down, you guys! Slow down!

324
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,080
- What's wrong?|- I told you, it wasn't my fault!

325
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,280
Where'd the dogs go? Go, go!

326
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,040
I want that Chihuahua!

327
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,560
English, please!|- Move it! Let's go!

328
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,440
- This way! This way!|- OK.

329
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,640
- My bootie!|- Your what?

330
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,000
- My bootie!|- Forget it!

331
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,240
- Forget it?|- Forget it!

332
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,080
- The Chihuahua!|- That's Italian leather, mister!

333
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,360
Look out!

334
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,600
Go! Go!

335
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,200
One at a time!

336
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,240
Hey! Wait a minute!|You won't fit!

337
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,400
I got it!

338
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,720
Oh, no. I lost another bootie.

339
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,600
I am sure I locked those cages, sir.

340
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,160
I want that Chihuahua!

341
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:33,280
Why?

342
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,480
She's worth something.

343
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:45,040
Judging by the diamonds|around her neck, it's a lot.

344
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,120
Look out.

345
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,680
What is all of this?

346
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,480
The Day of the Dead.

347
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,480
This is so beautiful.

348
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,520
It's what humans do|to honor their ancestors.

349
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,360
It keeps them... alive in their hearts.

350
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,160
Helps them remember who they are,|where they came from.

351
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,560
Wow!

352
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,600
- You're my dog!|- Delgado, "gracias," bro.

353
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,280
- I'm out of here!|- I'll see ya, kid.

354
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,760
Wait! Wait... Delgado!

355
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,000
"See ya?" That's it?

356
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,080
Number one rule of the streets,|"princesa. " Every dog for himself.

357
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,040
Now, get lost.

358
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,080
My name is not "Princesa. " It's Chloe.

359
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:47,120
And I am lost. And I want to be found.

360
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,120
Look, "princesa... "|I mean... look, kid.

361
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,080
I got my own problems.

362
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,360
I can't go back to the fights. |I got to get out of town.

363
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,280
- How does Beverly Hills sound?|- Too far.

364
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,240
Come on! If you could|figure out a way back,

365
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,640
you could live with us on our estate.

366
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,440
If you haven't noticed,|I'm a little large for a lapdog.

367
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,520
But you're the perfect size|for a guard dog.

368
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,240
Our old one... Papi, he... ran off.

369
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,120
You had a guard dog named Papi?

370
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,040
- What hotel you staying in?|- You'll do it?

371
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,680
Answer the question|before I change my mind!

372
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,560
I don't know the name, but believe me,|it was no Carthay Hotel.

373
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,400
The Carthay? There's one here. |Would they know you?

374
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,960
They should. We're preferred guests. |We have a gold card.

375
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,680
Why me? Of all the dogs in Mexico.

376
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,400
Why me? All I need,|Chihuahua with booties.

377
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,440
This'll be fun! You'll see.

378
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,520
Here's the GPS.

379
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,160
We're hot.

380
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,600
Diablo, you go get me that Chihuahua.

381
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,880
Go! Go!

382
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,280
- Hold up a second. |- Uh...

383
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,760
What's that sound?

384
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,600
Hmm. Hold your breath. |-

385
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,800
- What did you do that for?|- El Diablo's got your scent.

386
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,080
Of course he does. It's Chanel No. 5.

387
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,160
- Congratulations. |- Now I've lost another bootie...

388
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:44,720
- and I stink. |- I don't smell anything.

389
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,560
Are you kidding? I smell like a wet dog.

390
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,960
You are a wet dog.

391
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,120
- Look... "señorita... "|- Ashe.

392
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:59,600
Ashe. I'm sorry.

393
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,000
We're already trying to stop the fights.

394
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:09,160
And we don't have time to look|for every lost dog in Mexico.

395
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:11,000
This is not just any dog.

396
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,240
This is my Aunt Viv's dog. |Chloe means everything to her.

397
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,680
I'll tell you what.

398
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:23,000
Go back to your hotel, download|that photo you were telling me about

399
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,800
and I will see what I can do.

400
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,440
- "Gracias. "|- You're welcome!

401
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,240
- Hi, Aunt Viv. |- Ciao, Rachel.

402
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,280
Yes, Capri's fantastic.

403
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,480
I was trying the house earlier. |I was worried because nobody was there.

404
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,480
Yeah, we went out for Mexican.

405
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,560
Could I talk to her just a second?

406
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,920
Um... I'll put her on.

407
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,400
Hi, baby! How's my little baby?

408
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,400
I miss you, too! I miss you, too!

409
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,920
OK, here you are,|Your Highness. Carthay Hotel.

410
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,320
I feel like I'm home already!

411
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,120
- Thank you, Delgado. Thank you!|- All in a day's work.

412
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:37,120
But... maybe you should wait out here.

413
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,920
- Yeah, whatever. |- I don't mean it like it sounds,

414
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:44,240
but they can be a little particular|about the dogs they let in.

415
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,080
Knock yourself out.

416
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,200
We'll be eating gourmet food in no time.

417
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,480
"Bienvenidos al" Hotel Carthay. |- Thank you.

418
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,440
Excuse me. Would you be so kind|as to look at my collar?

419
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,640
You'll find my owner's|name and number.

420
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,920
Tshh! Get out!

421
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,880
Hello! Ew!

422
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,040
It touched me!

423
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,000
Get this mutt out of here.

424
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,120
Mutt? How dare you!|- Edgar!

425
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,200
I've been a preferred customer|at this hotel for years!

426
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,320
Don't you dare!

427
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:33,080
- I'm sorry. |- You are making a big mistake. Huge.

428
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,320
Really!

429
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,000
Oh, no.

430
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,160
I'm...

431
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,160
I'm... hideous.

432
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,200
What's taking her so long?

433
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,280
Hmm. Figures.

434
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,160
What did I expect... "de una princesa?"

435
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:32,720
Delgado, it was so humiliating. |You won't believe...

436
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,600
Delgado?

437
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,160
Delgado.

438
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,280
Excuse me. I'm here to see|Detective Ramirez.

439
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,440
Detective Ramirez is already with|someone, "señorita. " Five minutes, please.

440
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,120
Psst. Don't look now,|Hannah Montana, three o'clock.

441
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:26,040
What are you doing here?|I mean, "qué" are you doing here?

442
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,800
Isn't it obvious? To find Chloe.

443
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,280
Angela told me everything.

444
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,880
Why did you pretend|you couldn't speak English?

445
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,990
I didn't. You just assumed.

446
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,120
Thought you'd let me go along|and make a fool of myself?

447
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:39,960
Didn't need any help with that.

448
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,360
What makes you think|I need help from a gardener?

449
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,080
Oh, no, she didn't.

450
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,560
It's not that I have a|problem with that word, but,

451
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,360
actually, I am a landscaper.

452
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,880
And I'm not here for you.

453
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,320
I'm here for Vivian,|because she's like family to me.

454
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:06,560
I e-mailed a description|of the dog's collar to all our stations.

455
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,800
Chloe's collar. It's worth a fortune.

456
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,040
You're welcome.

457
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,160
Maybe a picture of the collar|might be even more helpful.

458
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:16,560
Yeah, a lot. "Gracias. "

459
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,920
So what should we do now?

460
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,400
We? Nothing.

461
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,960
You go back to|your hotel and wait. Please.

462
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,200
He's right. There's nothing you can do.

463
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,320
What? We're Mexi-can, not Mexi-can't!

464
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,640
I'm not going to stop looking. |He only cares about the collar.

465
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,720
I need the dog.

466
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,800
I'm with her, "amigo. "|My Chloe's in trouble.

467
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,080
Hey! Papi! Hey!

468
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:47,160
- Come on, fool. Let's go!|- Papi, where're you going?

469
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,840
I cannot believe Chloe's missing this.

470
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,040
Sebastian! Thank you.

471
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,520
Going to be on the cover|of "Purebred Monthly. "

472
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,480
- Oh. |- Whoo hoo!

473
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,240
This party is off the leash!

474
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,720
Whoa! Party!

475
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,840
So Scooter.

476
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,160
- Come here, Birthday Dog. |- No, Whiskey.

477
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:23,600
No, that really isn't necessary.

478
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,120
OK. Thank you, thank you.

479
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,680
Ooh.

480
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,640
Hey, you guys don't think|Chloe's in trouble, do you?

481
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,800
Paa-lease. I bet Rachel whisked her|off to some faboo place.

482
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,400
If I know Chloe...

483
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,480
she's sitting under a palm tree|being waited on by some hunky husky.

484
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,800
Oh! Thank you!

485
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,760
I must be starving.

486
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:58,000
- Yeah. That's our churro. |- "Sí," our churro.

487
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,720
Excuse me, but... I saw it first!

488
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,240
Better back off, "muchachos. "|-

489
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,120
Looks like we have|one of those Chihuahua warriors!

490
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,660
Now look, I've been dognapped,|lost my favorite cashmere sweater...

491
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:16,120
slept in a box and I'm starting another|in a series of bad hair days.

492
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,800
So don't... push me!

493
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,400
- Let's get out of here, man. |- Sorry... sorry.

494
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,960
That's what I thought. Ha!

495
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,600
It's time to pay the piper,|^iperra pequeña.

496
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,680
Where were we?|- Hang on, kid!

497
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:38,400
Still trying to be the hero!|I'll smell you out, Delgado.

498
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,080
The Aztec Empire's heart|was right here in Chapultepec Park.

499
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:48,440
Once used by the kings|as a royal retreat.

500
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,680
- Move it! Hurry up!|- I am!

501
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,720
- Come on! Two at a time!|- I have four-inch legs.

502
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,120
Come on. This way.

503
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:12,160
Not this way.

504
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,040
- Where to now?|- Now we're trapped.

505
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,680
- Now what?|- I'm thinking, I'm thinking.

506
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,440
Why did you abandon me?

507
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,440
I've already been abandoned once.

508
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,760
You left me, I didn't leave you!

509
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,600
I saw you in there|getting pampered, and eating...

510
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,000
The closest I came to food|was a used churro.

511
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,880
Come on, let's go.

512
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,240
- Where are we going?|- I'm taking you to Puerto Vallarta.

513
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,560
- Somebody there can help us. |- That on the way to Beverly Hills?

514
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,480
Over here. Jump in.

515
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,000
- Delgado?|- What?

516
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,880
Why is El Diablo after me?

517
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,160
Vasquez must have sent him.

518
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:23,280
Who's Vasquez?

519
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,920
He runs the dog fights and anything|else he can make a quick buck at.

520
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,040
The police have been after him|for years, but he's slippery.

521
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,440
How do you know all that?

522
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,400
Were you a criminal or something?

523
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,160
Or something. Get some sleep.

524
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,960
It's a long ride|and tomorrow's a big day.

525
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,520
What did El Diablo mean by,|"Still trying to be the hero?"

526
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,840
Never mind.

527
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:04,640
What the... |What's this? That's Chloe's bootie!

528
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,800
Hey, lady!

529
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,080
What? What is it?|Chloe's bootie. Good job.

530
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,960
She is near. I can feel it.

531
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,200
Hey, wait for me!

532
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,160
He said...

533
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:27,320
he saw a white Chihuahua|with a bunch of dogs run through here.

534
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,520
She was being carried|by a German Shepherd...

535
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,800
- German Shepherd carried my Chloe?|- Let's go!

536
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,800
I'm going to kick some tail. Papi style!

537
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,400
|- Yes?

538
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,120
"Someone else"|^iis looking for that dog.

539
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,400
There is a lot of money riding on|this Chihuahua, do you understand?

540
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,720
They cannot find her before we do.

541
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,440
- "I'm on it. "|- Good.

542
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,560
Come on, baby.

543
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,040
Come on, Diablo.

544
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,120
OK, this is us. We're here. |Shake your last bootie and let's go.

545
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,990
What's your plan?|- OK, here's the deal.

546
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,240
Plant your paws here, keep your muzzle|shut, and wait for me to come back.

547
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:37,000
But... where are you going?|Delgado?

548
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,720
You're very withholding, you know that?

549
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,000
I guess this is my day at the spa.

550
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,200
Ahh.

551
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,080
Much better.

552
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,080
There she is. |Now, you remember the con, right?

553
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,040
I don't really have to eat you, do I?

554
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:16,920
Only swallow my legs. |OK, here we go. Easy on the teeth.

555
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,950
- Act scary. |- OK.

556
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,280
Help! Help, please help me!

557
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:27,560
- Help me, somebody! Help!|- You're choking me.

558
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,640
Keep your tongue to yourself.

559
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,600
Help me! Somebody, please!

560
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,760
This is just like "Animal Planet. "|What do I do?

561
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,640
Something! Anything! Help!

562
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:41,320
Shoo, lizard. Shoo, shoo. |Regurgitate that rat!

563
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,880
Ew.

564
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:48,160
Oh, my gosh. Are you all right? Hello?

565
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,320
Are you an angel? Am I dead?

566
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,990
No. And I'm not an angel.

567
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,080
And yet you're wearing a halo.

568
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:06,000
This? This is my collar|from Harry Winston.

569
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,400
Is that in heaven?|- Well...

570
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,160
Sort of. Beverly Hills.

571
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:12,600
Ahh.

572
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:16,080
Beverly Hills. |You're a long way from home.

573
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,760
Perhaps I can be of assistance. |I am Manuel.

574
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,990
I work on a luxury cruise ship|as a porter...

575
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:28,000
tending to the discriminating needs|of refined, upscale dogs like yourself.

576
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,360
Really? Do you think you|could help me get home?

577
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,920
Well, you saved my life. |It's the very least I can do.

578
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:02,640
Delgado?

579
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,400
- Hey, Tomas. |- It's really you, cuz?

580
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,480
What happened? Where you been?|Nobody's seen you since...

581
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,160
You know, a while.

582
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Look... I'm doing this|little security gig.

583
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:17,040
I'm taking a rich Chihuahua|back to Beverly Hills.

584
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,760
She's got a tag|on her collar.

585
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,600
So take her to a rescue shelter.

586
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,400
- They'll read it and call the owner. |- Not that simple.

587
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:26,880
Vasquez is looking for her,|he's got informants everywhere.

588
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,000
He's even got El Diablo after her.

589
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:33,160
El Diablo. That's why you're doing it?

590
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,200
That "delincuente" is behind me.

591
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,560
It's just a job. Can you get|Officer Mendez to call her tag?

592
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,600
Yeah, OK. Bring it to me.

593
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,440
- I'll see what I can do. |- "Gracias. "

594
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,000
Come on, let's go. |I found someone to read your tag.

595
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:53,200
- Really? So did I.|- Where's your collar?

596
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,040
You're not the only one|who can get things done.

597
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,200
- What?|- I gave my collar to Manuel...

598
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,880
He is taking it to|the ship's captain to read.

599
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,960
Manuel? Who's Manuel?

600
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,400
The kindly pack rat|who's helping me out.

601
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,160
I saved him from|being eaten by an iguana.

602
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,920
An iguana? An iguana!

603
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,320
That is the oldest con in the book!|Iguanas are vegetarians!

604
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,440
I'm sorry. I don't meet|many iguanas on Rodeo Drive.

605
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,320
Without your ID tag...

606
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,360
there's nothing to separate you|from any collarless stray on the street!

607
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,080
But... Well...

608
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,320
Manuel promised me|he'd be right back from the ship.

609
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,560
What ship? That ship?

610
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:34,760
What happened to the|"don't talk to strangers"?

611
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,840
You said nothing about iguanas.

612
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:48,920
then I said, "Are you an|angel?" American dogs are so gullible.

613
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,240
Chico, who is the|greatest con man in Mexico?

614
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:56,000
You are. And now,|can we steal some lunch? I'm hungry.

615
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,600
- Where did you get that?|- Please don't eat me, man!

616
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,800
I got a wife and 300 kids to feed.

617
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,600
- Eat him first!|- Where is the Chihuahua?

618
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:07,760
Chihuahua? I don't know any Chihuahua. |I'm from the Yucatán.

619
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:11,800
Of course if you'd like to meet one,|I could arrange it for the right price.

620
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,950
You're about to be lunch.

621
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,080
That's the right price. |How'd you know?

622
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,200
Do something, Manuel.

623
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,600
You're trying my patience, "chaparrito. "

624
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,280
Stop trying his patience.

625
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,840
- Where is she?|- By the fountain, near the docks.

626
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,920
I didn't know she was a friend of yours. |I was just borrowing it.

627
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,400
Please don't hurt me.

628
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,840
Hmm. Hmm.

629
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:39,120
Ha! That's dog's lucky|I didn't cha-cha on his chest.

630
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,720
You know, Manuel, I don't think|that dog was a friend of hers.

631
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,000
It's not our problem, Chico.

632
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,440
Come on, let's go raid a piñata. |I feel like feeding my sweet tooth.

633
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:53,360
Leave me out of this, Manuel. |Where there's a piñata, there's a stick.

634
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,480
- Uh, Delgado?|- Yeah?

635
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,560
What are we doing here?

636
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:05,120
- This is where we meet the coyote. |- A coyote?

637
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:09,280
A smuggler. They sneak collarless dogs|like us across the border.

638
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,160
You used to be a police dog, didn't you?

639
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:21,000
That's how you know Sergeant Tomas. |That's how you can do all those things.

640
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:24,480
- I don't want to talk about it. |- Did you quit? Did you get fired?

641
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,320
Did you do something wrong?

642
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,120
Yes, I did something wrong, OK?|You satisfied?

643
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,000
Now, just drop it.

644
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,360
OK. OK.

645
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,120
There he is. We're on. Follow me.

646
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,880
- And no more questions. |- OK. OK.

647
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:48,520
But what was it? Was someone hurt?|- Drop it! Just drop it!

648
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,080
You're driving me crazy.

649
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:55,120
You're not exactly the most charming|traveling companion either.

650
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,720
- Good, because we're parting ways. |- What?

651
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,640
Wait, wait! What are you doing?

652
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,320
This train will take you to Tijuana.

653
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,560
- But... |- But nothing.

654
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,560
The coyote will take you|over the border.

655
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,080
- "Buenos Días. "|- "Wha... "

656
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,160
Make yourself at home.

657
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,240
Best of luck.

658
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,880
But... you promised.

659
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,400
Delgado...

660
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,520
Don't turn around. Don't turn around.

661
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,440
Don't... What am I doing?

662
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,400
- Delgado!|- Chloe!

663
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:04,880
- Delgado!|- Chloe!

664
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,280
Come on. Jump!

665
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:10,320
It's a fast train!

666
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,200
You can do it! Jump!

667
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,560
That hurt.

668
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,280
OK, good.

669
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,920
- I could use a little help. |- I'll pull you up.

670
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,400
Don't help. Don't help. |-

671
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:39,200
What can I say? A promise is a promise.

672
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,280
Sure thing, Delgado.

673
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,600
Sam! How do you say|"lost" in Spanish?

674
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,160
Chloe.

675
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,280
Wait, he's got something.

676
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,400
Papi! Papi!

677
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:12,800
You! That scent. |Where did you get that scent?

678
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,400
Maybe you haven't noticed,

679
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,920
but I'm currently napping|in a sewage pipe.

680
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,680
You mean the moldy taco?

681
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,000
No, fool. The perfume. It's Chloe's.

682
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,720
She's an American Chihuahua.

683
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,400
Her ears are as pink as seashells...

684
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,240
and her nose is like a raspberry.

685
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:35,000
- You serious, bro?|- Eh? A berry?

686
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,880
Is she kind of uppity?|Wears matching clothes?

687
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
- You know her? Where is she?|- Last we saw her...

688
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,680
- she was with Delgado on the run. |- Yeah.

689
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,960
- Mm-hm. |- Delgado? Who is this Delgado?

690
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,560
I want to hear more. Come with me.

691
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:59,040
Looks like he found a couple of friends.

692
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:02,000
Just what we need, stray dogs.

693
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:07,720
Papi was a stray dog. |I saved him from the pound.

694
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,000
Hey, buddy.

695
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,880
He inspires me every day. |What inspires you, Rachel?

696
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,480
Get back to you on that.

697
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,520
|- Hey.

698
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:26,160
Look at that. How you doing? Hello.

699
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:30,120
I guess he is kind of cute. |We could take them with us,

700
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:32,360
but you have to give them a bath,|they stink.

701
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,920
I can handle that.

702
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,600
- You stink! Oh!|- You just need a bath.

703
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:39,960
Oh, I love this!

704
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:43,160
I think I'm in love with the "gringa. "

705
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,800
- I think he likes it. |- I think he likes you.

706
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,880
Where you going? Wait for me!

707
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,160
Oh, yeah. "Mira," I'm clean. |I'm clean. I never knew clean.

708
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,680
I know clean now.

709
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,680
I have never had|my teeth brushed before.

710
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,720
It's... minty.

711
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,520
It's weird.

712
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,400
Papi, this is great!

713
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:22,040
- We should call room service. |- Let's order a movie.

714
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,000
Have we found a home, Papi?

715
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:29,000
I don't know, but they'll make sure|you're safe.

716
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,880
Sam did it for me.

717
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,880
See you tomorrow.

718
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,080
- Come on. |- No, they can stay with me.

719
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,360
I take responsibility.

720
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,440
Cool.

721
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,280
Papi, what do you see, "compa?"

722
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,280
It's a big place, my little friend.

723
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:50,080
I may be small, but I am fighting...

724
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,720
for something... bigger than all of it.

725
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,440
^iMi Corazón.

726
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,720
Excuse me. Where are you from?

727
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:25,560
I'm from Beverly Hills. |- Where is that?

728
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:30,360
Well... it feels like|a long way from here.

729
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,320
"Señorita," what is that?

730
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,120
It's a bootie. I lost the others.

731
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,320
All the dogs in Beverly Hills|wear them to protect their feet.

732
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,680
It must be very dirty there.

733
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:47,160
No. Actually, it's probably|the cleanest place I know.

734
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,880
Then that's pretty silly|to wear a bootie.

735
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,320
Pedro, be polite.

736
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,520
You know something, Pedro?

737
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,240
You're right.

738
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,280
|- Rachel.

739
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:38,560
Rachel.

740
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:41,040
Come on, Sleeping Beauty, let's go.

741
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,960
Detective Ramirez called.

742
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:46,200
A white Chihuahua and a German|Shepherd were seen in Puerto Vallarta.

743
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:49,400
They're not sure if it was her,|she wasn't wearing her collar.

744
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,840
What? Someone stole Chloe's collar?

745
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,840
I'm going to go|all kinds of Mexican on him.

746
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,720
Chico, I have this pain|in the pit of my stomach.

747
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:04,600
- Must have been the Pop Rocks. |- Or it could be... guilt.

748
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,200
We should have never|stolen that "chica's" collar.

749
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,880
Now she'll never get home.

750
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,920
Let's get out of here!

751
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,280
Make a left, make a left.

752
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,360
Aisle four, tortillas on the floor.

753
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:44,120
- I feel naked. |- Every man for himself!

754
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,400
- My head!|- Go through his legs!

755
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,960
This way. Come on!

756
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,080
Back the other way!

757
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:56,960
Get off me!

758
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:02,240
Hey, Chico! We're home free!

759
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,040
Back up, back up!

760
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,000
That's what you get!

761
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,360
Hey! He's got my diamonds!

762
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,120
- Our diamonds. |- Whatever.

763
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:43,320
Wake up! The conductor's coming!|Hide! "Rápido," hide!

764
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,600
What's going on?

765
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,360
- Delgado, what's happening?|- We got trouble.

766
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,360
Hide behind the crate. |I'll distract him.

767
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,480
Don't come out,|no matter what happens.

768
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:58,680
But, Delgado...

769
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,720
Don't come out,|no matter what happens.

770
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,040
- What are you gonna do?|- Something crazy.

771
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,480
Well, that used to be easier.

772
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,480
Just my luck.

773
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,880
Delgado!

774
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,480
- Oh, my gosh. |- Oh, my back.

775
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:41,440
- Did you see that?|- Yes.

776
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:46,640
I just jumped off a train!|By myself! And it was moving.

777
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,040
I told you to stay onboard.

778
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:53,520
But we're in this together. |I couldn't leave you here.

779
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,560
I've never had a friend like you.

780
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,640
You should have stayed, kid. |Look around.

781
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,040
You should have stayed.

782
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:11,080
I told the local police|I found the collar on a rat.

783
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,200
But they didn't believe me.

784
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,440
I went to turn the diamonds in,|and they tried to arrest me.

785
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:19,120
Sorry for the confusion, "señor. "

786
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:21,440
The rat, he's clever.

787
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,440
"Oye," this "hombre" needs help.

788
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,600
I set traps to keep him out,|but he always gets in!

789
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,000
Sneaky, sneaky mouse.

790
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,400
You know what you need?

791
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,200
|- A guard dog.

792
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,040
- He's a stray. |- Yeah, he's a stray...

793
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,280
but he's a really good dog.

794
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,000
Thanks for|returning Chloe's collar.

795
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:51,040
Congratulations, "amigo. " You have a home.

796
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:54,120
"Gracias," Rafa. |It will happen for you, too.

797
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,920
Stay brown, brother.

798
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,080
Come on. |Ain't nothing to it but to do it.

799
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,600
- "Adiós"|- "Adiós," Chucho.

800
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,160
Hey, don't chew the furniture.

801
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,320
Good luck finding your dog. |- Thank you.

802
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,480
I just got off|with the Puerto Vallarta police.

803
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:12,360
There was some dog trouble|on the northbound train this morning.

804
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:14,200
A German Shepherd jumped off.

805
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:16,560
Chloe.

806
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,040
- Thank you. |- Call me if you find out anything.

807
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:23,560
Follow the tracks north. |- Through the Sonoran Desert.

808
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,160
This will be great.

809
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,280
She's getting away with my diamonds.

810
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:30,600
I think that that's like... |karma, man.

811
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:34,680
See, you steal it,|and eventually it is stolen from you.

812
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,240
And I steal it back.

813
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,080
- How you going to do that?|- Quiet!

814
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:01,040
So, Bimini says that|she's going out with Scooter...

815
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:03,320
who I happen to know|is completely crazy.

816
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,120
Please, make it stop.

817
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:08,440
I can't say that to her. |I have to be supportive, right?

818
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:12,440
Wait a minute. Haven't we|passed this tree before?

819
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:17,000
No, you're mistaken. |We've been walking for hours.

820
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:20,080
- But I tinkled there. |- You what?

821
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,160
You tinkled?

822
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,480
Can't you tell?

823
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:31,240
Oh, my... You can't smell, can you?

824
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,000
- No. |- What happened?

825
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,240
It's OK, you can tell me.

826
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,880
I didn't... quit the police force.

827
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:47,320
They let me go because|I could no longer follow a scent.

828
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,240
Now we're out here walking in circles.

829
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,480
I'm sorry, kid.

830
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,280
- What's that?|- Mountain lions!

831
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:00,640
- I'm scared, Delgado. |- I know.

832
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:04,040
We better get moving. |We got to get out of the open.

833
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:05,760
- OK.|- Let's go. Double time.

834
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:21,760
Delgado, what happened to you?

835
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,840
Why can't you smell anything?

836
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,200
Well...

837
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:36,880
My partner and I... |we were on a major bust.

838
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:39,800
^iI was on point.

839
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:44,840
^iBefore I knew it I was blind-sided. |^iThen it all went bad.

840
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:53,160
^iWhile I was down,|^imy partner got hurt.

841
01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:00,600
^iHe was never the same after that. |^iAnd neither was I.

842
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:07,120
I should have sensed him coming.

843
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:10,240
Next day I woke up|and couldn't smell a thing.

844
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:12,200
Were you hurt?

845
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:14,880
No. They say it's all in my head.

846
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,160
In my head.

847
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,360
They found us!

848
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:22,880
I'll hold them off as long as I can|while you run. Understand?

849
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,920
They're just cats. |You could take them.

850
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:29,880
We need a miracle. Run when I say run!

851
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,480
Come on! Take them!|-

852
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:33,920
Yeah, you can do it!

853
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:36,920
Don't be afraid!

854
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:40,880
Go, Delgado! Go, Delgado!

855
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:46,000
- Run, kid! Run, now!|- OK, OK.

856
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:47,600
- Run and hide!|- Here. I'm here.

857
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:49,360
This is not hiding.

858
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,720
Say hello to my little friends.

859
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:25,800
Whoa! That's some bark you guys got.

860
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:29,240
I am Montezuma!|Come with us if you want to live.

861
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:31,520
Yeah, I want to live.

862
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:33,920
Now I've seen it all.

863
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:42,200
Can you help us get back|to civilization, Montezuma?

864
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:43,800
Of course.

865
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:47,120
But it is too dangerous|to travel these canyons after dark.

866
01:02:47,170 --> 01:02:50,040
You will spend the night here with us.

867
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:51,720
Where are we?

868
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:56,200
You are in Chihuahua. |Birthplace of our mighty breed.

869
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,960
I was born in Beverly Hills.

870
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:03,040
"Sí," but your ancestors came from here.

871
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,200
The Aztec people left long ago,|but we remain.

872
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:12,560
Wow.

873
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,400
Did you hear what he said, Delgado?

874
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:33,240
- I come from a mighty breed. |- Yeah, mighty annoying.

875
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:37,040
You're just mad because|we were saved by little dogs.

876
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,400
Very little dogs.

877
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:43,040
Tonight we celebrate your arrival.

878
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,040
Thank you, Montezuma.

879
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:48,720
Please, call me Monte.

880
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,640
|- "Ay yi yi. "

881
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:00,800
Wow! All this for me, Monte?

882
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,200
Yes, Chloe.

883
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:06,240
When a Chihuahua comes home,|it is cause for celebration.

884
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:08,950
Even a Beverly Hills Chihuahua?

885
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:14,160
Of course. No matter where|you come from, you are one of us.

886
01:04:14,210 --> 01:04:16,950
Tiny but mighty.

887
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,400
Mighty? But I'm just... a lapdog.

888
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:23,320
A lapdog? No.

889
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,120
Do not insult yourself. Do not insult|the Chihuahua race.

890
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:31,200
" No más. "|- No más?

891
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:35,080
"Sí," it means "no more. "

892
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:39,720
We Chihuahuas are not toys|or fashion accessories.

893
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,040
^i No más.

894
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:45,840
We were not bred to wear silly hats|and ride in purses!

895
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:47,080
"No más. "

896
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:51,000
We will no longer|be spoken to with baby talk.

897
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:55,040
We have been called "teacup"|and "tiny toy" for too long.

898
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:56,400
"No más!"

899
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:59,080
Names like Fifi, Foo-Foo...

900
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:02,120
Pookie, Pumpkin, or Squirt.

901
01:05:02,170 --> 01:05:03,400
"No más!"

902
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:08,560
Yes, we Chihuahuas shake, but not for|the amusement of humans.

903
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:13,720
We shake because we know the power|of our inner strength. Our bark.

904
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:14,840
"No más!"

905
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:19,080
Yes, we are tiny, but we are mighty!

906
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:22,990
"No más! No más! No más!"

907
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:28,240
Join with us, Chloe. |Embrace "no más. " Find your bark.

908
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:30,840
My bark?

909
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:34,320
"Sí!" That which makes you mighty.

910
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,000
That which makes you... you.

911
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:41,640
We are Chihuahuas, hear us roar.

912
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,280
That was embarrassing.

913
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:56,680
Don't worry, little one. Your bark will|come when you need it most.

914
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:30,920
Last one in the house is a chew toy!

915
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:34,280
They have room.

916
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,040
Come on. Little more.

917
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:38,520
You got it now. Now pull. |- I got it, I got it.

918
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:41,480
- Sweet smell of success. |- I'm smelling something else.

919
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,280
There's the bag. There's the bag that's|got my diamonds. Hey, watch your nose!

920
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,960
I don't feel right about this.

921
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:52,920
Look, my neck flap is swelling up.

922
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:57,280
Stop with the guilt. |Iguanas are supposed to be cold-blooded.

923
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:01,560
You know I was born in captivity. |I grew up under a heat lamp.

924
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:03,640
Snap out of it. We got a job to do.

925
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:07,280
Ah-hah! You're the pack rat|who stole the collar!

926
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:09,960
See? You're so busted, Manuel.

927
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:14,040
Hey, dude, you got me mixed up with|another rat. You know we all look alike.

928
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:16,400
- No, no. It's him. He did it. |- What?

929
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:19,000
Now the love of my life|is out there in trouble.

930
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,640
- Not because of us. |- No?

931
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,880
- We were trying to... save her. |- Yeah.

932
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
From the demon dog that's hunting her.

933
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:28,000
Tell me about this demon dog.

934
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:59,360
Chloe, you can always stay here with us.

935
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,880
This place is amazing, Monte.

936
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:07,960
But there's someone at home who's|probably worried and missing me...

937
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:10,000
and I miss him.

938
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:11,990
Your "corazón?"

939
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:15,600
"Mi corazón. " What does that mean?

940
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,320
My heart.

941
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:21,040
I never even gave him a chance.

942
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:24,950
We Chihuahuas come|in many shapes and colors...

943
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:30,160
but when you look not with your eyes,|but with your soul,

944
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:32,760
there we're all the same.

945
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:36,800
Listen... back there with the lions...

946
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:40,520
...uh... uh... thanks.

947
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:44,880
But of course. We are Chihuahuas.

948
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:51,760
Ah! Civilization at last. |We made it, Delgado.

949
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:54,280
- Delgado!|- Just keep paddling!

950
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:56,760
Whoa!|

951
01:08:56,840 --> 01:09:00,800
- That was fun!|- Yeah, you're a real aquatic goddess.

952
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:04,040
- Delgado, look!|- What?

953
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:06,560
Is that you? Nice toga.

954
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:10,000
I can't believe Rachel's looking for me.

955
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:11,680
Let's get some help.

956
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,200
- Chloe. |- "Sí. "

957
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:41,680
We always kept a dog|when my husband was alive.

958
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:48,320
He'd make a great companion. |You guys are perfect for each other.

959
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,320
Somebody's got a lady friend.

960
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,200
I have a home.

961
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:57,200
We're on our way. Hey, Rachel,|that was Ramirez. They found Chloe.

962
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,080
Whoa. Awkward.

963
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:13,920
We should go. |Ramirez is going to meet us there.

964
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:16,120
I told you,|everything's going to be fine.

965
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:32,480
This is the place.

966
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:37,520
Chloe!

967
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:44,320
Hello?

968
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:49,000
OK, how about here?|You American dogs are so picky.

969
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:54,800
OK, go. What?

970
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:00,440
Ah. Excuse me, "señorita. "|Please, please, go.

971
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:08,120
I've seen that "gringo" before.

972
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:14,680
"Oye," that van. My Chloe's been there.

973
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,950
Right on, Mighty Dog. Power to the Papi.

974
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,440
Now go get her!|- Go get your "princesa. "

975
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,800
"¡Mi corazón!"|- So romantic.

976
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:26,880
Man, I thought we'd|never get rid of him.

977
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:29,520
- Come on. |- Now I'll finally get my diamonds.

978
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,840
For the love of a banana,|hurry. Ow!

979
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:43,320
^iSeñora?

980
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,880
Oh, no. No!

981
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:52,560
Chloe!

982
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:57,560
Turn me loose!|- What did he say?

983
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:00,160
- Don't worry, we're going to find her. |- What?

984
01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:01,360
Oh!

985
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:03,760
I'm going to look for her.

986
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:06,520
Kid!

987
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,440
Kid! Where are you? Chloe!

988
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:17,480
Where are you taking me?

989
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,840
Good job, Diablo. Good job.

990
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,480
You've been a lot of trouble, huh?|I hope you're worth it.

991
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:49,080
I need to call the owners,|so get the dog in the van.

992
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:50,280
Yes, sir.

993
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,440
Surprise!

994
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:02,760
Don't mess with a Chihuahua!

995
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:07,840
Papi! What are you doing here!

996
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:10,160
Rescuing you. Run!

997
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:12,440
- Come on. |- I'm coming.

998
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:15,880
Go! Diablo, go!

999
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:20,320
Get that Chihuahua!|- Which one?

1000
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,600
- The mean one!|- Papi!

1001
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:24,560
- We're trapped!|- I will protect you, "mi corazón. "

1002
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:31,640
Hold on, Chloe!

1003
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:33,640
Come on, little brat.

1004
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:41,640
Ow!

1005
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:44,040
Oh, my back. I need an aspirin.

1006
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:46,200
- Doesn't that hurt?|- You see a tooth around?

1007
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:48,240
You two! What are you doing here?

1008
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:49,680
It's not what you think.

1009
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:52,840
Look... we're not trying|to steal this collar.

1010
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:54,840
- Right. |- Maybe we are.

1011
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:57,880
Look, what my partner's|trying to say is, if you hurry,

1012
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:00,080
- you can pick up her scent using this. |- Yeah.

1013
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:03,040
- I can't. |- What?

1014
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:06,120
I make this noble gesture,|you're not even going to try?

1015
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:09,040
What's the point of having that|thing on the end of your face?

1016
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:13,080
- I can't!|- She needs you, man.

1017
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:16,880
- What part don't you understand?|- She needs you, man!

1018
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:19,040
You can do it! Smell.

1019
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:24,400
- That's it. |- You can do it, Delgado. Come on.

1020
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:27,440
Smell.

1021
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:31,200
I'm getting something. Pack rat.

1022
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:34,080
Old nachos.

1023
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:38,440
Chanel No. 5.

1024
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,320
He's got it!

1025
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:42,440
I have a Chihuahua to save.

1026
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:46,950
- He's got my collar!|- Yeah, he's got it.

1027
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,320
You did a good thing, Manuel. |You know you did a good thing.

1028
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:54,040
|- You're blushing. You're blushing.

1029
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,920
That's Chloe's collar.

1030
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:05,080
He wants to lead us|to the Chihuahua. Let's go.

1031
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:17,040
Be careful. |The whole structure is crumbling.

1032
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:26,720
Rafferty,|there's no sign of the dog.

1033
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,520
Hey, tough guy,|you're lucky I'm locked in.

1034
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,000
Rafferty, come in.

1035
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:33,400
You look confused.

1036
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:37,040
Hey, man, where you going?|To find the rest of your tail?

1037
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:38,680
Rafferty, come in.

1038
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:45,040
I know you're here, "chica. "|I can smell you.

1039
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,080
Rafferty, come in, come in.

1040
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:52,320
- "Rafferty. "|- Sorry, you're breaking up, boss.

1041
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:59,120
I'm going to get you now, you rat.

1042
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:04,360
Hello. One down.

1043
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:09,880
Rafferty, what's going on?|Talk to me. What's going on?

1044
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:11,960
- Chloe, you're okay. |- Shhh.

1045
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:14,400
Come in. I cannot hear you. Come on.

1046
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:19,680
- Who you been hanging around with?|- Diablo, let's get out...

1047
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:22,360
Get them. Get them!|- Run!

1048
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:24,040
Follow me!|- We can do it!

1049
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:27,400
Whoa, you heard the man. |Come on, get me.

1050
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:28,840
Too slow, gotta go!

1051
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:34,760
Come here. Come here!

1052
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:40,480
You better watch out, dog. |I'm going to beat you like a piñata!

1053
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,440
They don't call me|Papi Loco for nothing!

1054
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:45,200
Come on, little rat. Come on!

1055
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:47,360
- Whoa!|- Papi!

1056
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:50,240
Say goodbye to your "corazón. "

1057
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:53,760
"No... más. "

1058
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:56,920
"No más. "

1059
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
It's over.

1060
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:00,200
- Chloe!|- "No más!"

1061
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:06,000
Wow! That's my bark.

1062
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,040
I barked!

1063
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:22,840
I barked!

1064
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,000
Two down.

1065
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:30,360
He's all yours, Officer.

1066
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:33,640
"Señor" Vasquez.

1067
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:35,280
- Did you see that?|- Wow.

1068
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,360
I barked!

1069
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:39,960
"Ai, Mami!" Nice set of pipes!

1070
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:42,080
|- Run!

1071
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:44,480
It's time to finish what I started.

1072
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,720
You don't scare me anymore!

1073
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,640
Then why are you shaking?

1074
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:50,400
Because I am a Chihuahua!

1075
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:53,480
Diablo!

1076
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:56,040
Big mistake.

1077
01:17:56,090 --> 01:17:57,800
Leave him alone!

1078
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:01,400
Chloe, what are you doing?|- You owe me a cashmere sweater.

1079
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,680
Hang on, Chloe!|- Kid, hang on.

1080
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:06,040
How dare you!|- Chloe, watch out!

1081
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,780
It's over, Diablo! It is over!

1082
01:18:13,830 --> 01:18:16,440
You took everything from me.

1083
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:19,400
Now, we're even. |-

1084
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:20,600
Chloe?

1085
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,120
Mi corazón?

1086
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:30,720
Kid?

1087
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:34,640
She's... gone.

1088
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:37,880
Wake up, "mi corazón. "

1089
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
It's me. Your Papi.

1090
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:44,760
Speak to me.

1091
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:48,920
Fill my ears with your beautiful voice.

1092
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:54,440
Without you, the sun|will have no warmth...

1093
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:56,880
the flowers, no beauty.

1094
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,800
Chloe, my tail will have no wag.

1095
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:07,880
Come back to Beverly Hills with me,|and I will tend your garden forever.

1096
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:13,000
Your love is the rain|that falls upon my earth.

1097
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:17,000
Don't stop now. It's just getting good.

1098
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:19,120
^iAi Chihuahua!

1099
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:22,640
Papi, that was beautiful.

1100
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:25,160
Chloe, you're back. You're back.

1101
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:26,480
Chloe?

1102
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:27,960
She's back!

1103
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,160
You're OK.

1104
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:35,240
Chloe, where have you been?

1105
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:40,680
Rachel, you missed all the fun.

1106
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:44,040
You are one tough Chihuahua.

1107
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:47,120
Tiny but mighty.

1108
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:48,680
Hi, Chloe.

1109
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:53,200
Hi. Hi.

1110
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:15,680
So you're the... guard dog.

1111
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:19,480
No, man. I'm a landscaper.

1112
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:22,480
Oops. |- Right.

1113
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,920
Well, "adiós," kid.

1114
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:27,760
Oh, uh... Delgado.

1115
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:32,040
You know,|Vivian could still use a guard dog.

1116
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:36,120
Thanks for the offer,|but someone has to go after El Diablo.

1117
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:41,040
Besides, "princesa," I think you|can take care of things yourself now.

1118
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:43,600
I'll miss you.

1119
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:48,000
Yeah, I'll miss you, too, kid. |But this isn't goodbye.

1120
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:51,040
I'm sure we'll be|seeing each other again.

1121
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,800
Don't turn around. Don't turn around.

1122
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:06,200
Maybe you could use|a little extra help on the force.

1123
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,480
Where do you think|you are going, officer?

1124
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:26,760
Ready to get back on the job?

1125
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:30,240
Officer!

1126
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,800
Yeah. Good boy. Good boy.

1127
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:45,880
Chloe! Papi! Let's go home.

1128
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,280
We gotta get home before Aunt Viv does.

1129
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:51,480
Hey, come here.

1130
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:55,160
Goodbye, my friends.

1131
01:21:56,640 --> 01:22:00,600
"Adiós, amigo. "|- " Adiós," kid.

1132
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:02,760
"Muchas gracias," Delgado.

1133
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:08,960
Thank you, Chloe. |I've never had a friend like you.

1134
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:16,840
Great, she's not home yet. |She'll be here any minute.

1135
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:21,120
- Can you get the bags?|- Yeah, I'll get the bags.

1136
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:23,560
- I'll put her in the tub. |- Go, go, go.

1137
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:24,640
Hurry up!

1138
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,400
Come on. We're going to make it.

1139
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:30,680
Oh-oh. Think fast, "amigo. "

1140
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:38,960
Hi! How are you? Welcome.

1141
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:43,240
- Welcome. Hi. |- What a surprise. Hello.

1142
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:46,160
I took photographs|of the most wonderful gardens.

1143
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:49,320
You're not going to believe. |First, I want to go see Chloe.

1144
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:53,880
- Actually, I need you to see something. |- That's the best you can do?

1145
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:56,920
- Something you're gonna love. |- Should I bite her leg?

1146
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,760
By the way, you look exhausted. |You've been working too hard.

1147
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:04,240
Chloe? Chloe.

1148
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:06,800
- Sam, put my bags over there, please?|- Yes.

1149
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:10,480
Chloe? Rachel?

1150
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:13,680
- Hi, Aunt Viv. |- Hi.

1151
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:15,520
- Hi. |- Hi.

1152
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,400
Your hair is all wet.

1153
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,960
I was in a bath.

1154
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:25,760
- Oh. Where's my Chloe?|- There she is.

1155
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,240
Hi, sweetheart.

1156
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:33,160
Hi. Come here. |Hi, sweetheart.

1157
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:37,840
My baby girl. My sweet angel.

1158
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:39,880
I missed you so much. I did.

1159
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:41,200
Yes, I did.

1160
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:44,880
What's that smell? What's that...

1161
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:49,440
It's sort of... urban and...

1162
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:53,720
kind of earthy... and it's fabulous.

1163
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:55,840
That's Mexico No. 5.

1164
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:02,040
I can't believe I'm running over|a pond in my best dress.

1165
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:06,080
So does this mean you're no longer a|prissy Beverly Hills Chihuahua?

1166
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:10,360
Beverly Hills, "sí. " Prissy, "no más. "

1167
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:15,040
How do you say "What are you doing|on Friday night" in Spanish?

1168
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:25,950
Me? Nothing. And you?

1169
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,680
- "Nada. "|- "Bueno," let's...

1170
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:32,280
After the way I treated you,

1171
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:35,600
I can't believe you came after me.

1172
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:37,400
How could I not?

1173
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:47,120
I think I'm... going to cry.

1174
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:54,240
Oh, Chloe.

1175
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:57,640
Papi likes.

1176
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:05,840
