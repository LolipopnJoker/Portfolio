4
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,994
I do hope
that Mr. Wick

5
00:03:00,996 --> 00:03:02,863
finds his way to safety.

6
00:03:02,865 --> 00:03:05,031
He knew the rules,
he broke them.

7
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:07,501
And killed a man
on company grounds, Charon.

8
00:03:07,503 --> 00:03:09,603
Do you expect him
to make it out?

9
00:03:09,605 --> 00:03:11,471
$14 million bounty
on his head.

10
00:03:11,473 --> 00:03:15,074
And every interested party in
this city wants a piece of it.

11
00:03:15,076 --> 00:03:17,646
I'd say the odds
are about even.

12
00:03:35,664 --> 00:03:38,063
You think the hospital's
there to help, man?

13
00:03:38,065 --> 00:03:39,232
No way!

14
00:03:39,234 --> 00:03:42,536
They'll kill you just as soon
as they'll make you better!

15
00:03:42,538 --> 00:03:44,571
But I know better, man.

16
00:03:44,573 --> 00:03:46,409
I know better.
I know what I'm...

17
00:03:54,516 --> 00:03:55,848
Tick tock, Mr. Wick.

18
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,386
Tick tock.

19
00:03:57,853 --> 00:03:59,585
Tick tock.

20
00:03:59,587 --> 00:04:02,889
Tick tock. Tick...

21
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:05,027

You got it.

00:04:42,597 --> 00:04:43,633
Change of plan.

25
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:48,034
To the Continental.

26
00:04:48,036 --> 00:04:50,807
Can you see that he's received
by the concierge?

27
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:53,542
Yes, sir, Mr. Wick.

know the difference?

You sure this is what

It's a lot of money.

Know what?

91
00:13:07,635 --> 00:13:10,005
I told you
where the medicine was.

92
00:13:26,453 --> 00:13:28,553
- Where?
- Here.

93
00:13:28,555 --> 00:13:29,755

00:13:35,597 --> 00:13:37,466

97
00:13:41,435 --> 00:13:43,438
Yeah. All right.

98
00:13:44,805 --> 00:13:46,305

99
00:13:46,307 --> 00:13:48,476

103
00:16:00,425 --> 00:16:01,700
Open the door.

104
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,188

106
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:25,500

We are closed.

111
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,398

112
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,695
And the belt.

113
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,192

00:25:57,036 --> 00:26:01,442
Jardani.
Why have you come home?

119
00:26:07,081 --> 00:26:09,514
You present this to me
like an answer.

120
00:26:09,516 --> 00:26:11,885
I still have my ticket.

121
00:26:13,353 --> 00:26:16,388
After all the chaos you've
caused for the last few weeks,

122
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:18,890
you think
your ticket is valid?

123
00:26:18,892 --> 00:26:21,059
You forget
that the Ruska Roma

124
00:26:21,061 --> 00:26:22,961
is bound by the High Table,

125
00:26:22,963 --> 00:26:26,231
and the High Table
stands above all?

126
00:26:26,233 --> 00:26:28,436
They could kill me
just for talking to you.

127
00:26:30,103 --> 00:26:35,075
You honor me by bringing death
to my front door.

128
00:26:36,944 --> 00:26:41,116
Oh, Jardani,
what has become of you?

129
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:46,736
I am Jardani Jovonovich.

130
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,033
I am a child of the Belarus.

131
00:26:51,034 --> 00:26:54,900
An orphan of your tribe.

132
00:26:54,901 --> 00:26:58,220
You are bound to help me.

133
00:26:59,332 --> 00:27:01,399
You are bound...

134
00:27:01,401 --> 00:27:03,938
And I am owed.

135
00:27:08,374 --> 00:27:10,044
Rooney, enough!

136
00:27:18,936 --> 00:27:20,171
Follow me.

137
00:27:41,441 --> 00:27:44,443
"You are owed."
You are owed nothing, Jardani.

138
00:27:44,445 --> 00:27:46,645
You know, when my pupils
first come here,

139
00:27:46,647 --> 00:27:48,413
they wish for one thing.

140
00:27:48,415 --> 00:27:50,983
A life free of suffering.

141
00:27:50,985 --> 00:27:53,584
I try to dissuade them
from these childish notions,

142
00:27:53,586 --> 00:27:55,856
but as you know,

143
00:27:56,623 --> 00:27:58,125
art is pain.

144
00:28:01,527 --> 00:28:03,530
Life is suffering.

145
00:28:08,468 --> 00:28:10,938
Somehow,
you managed to get out.

146
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:14,208
But here you are,
back where you began.

147
00:28:15,309 --> 00:28:17,378
All of this, for what?

148
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,629
For a dog?

149
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,700
It wasn't just a dog.

150
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,200
Bringing back old memories?

151
00:28:54,247 --> 00:28:55,513
Pirouette.

152
00:28:57,217 --> 00:28:59,650
Pirouette, pirouette.

153
00:29:02,456 --> 00:29:03,536
Sit.

154
00:29:17,236 --> 00:29:22,075
Even if I wanted to,
I can't help you, Jardani.

155
00:29:23,043 --> 00:29:25,280
The High Table
wants your life.

156
00:29:26,112 --> 00:29:29,013
How can you fight the wind?

157
00:29:29,015 --> 00:29:30,581
How can you smash
the mountains?

158
00:29:30,583 --> 00:29:33,251
How can you bury the ocean?

159
00:29:33,253 --> 00:29:35,987
How can you escape
from the light?

160
00:29:35,989 --> 00:29:38,557
Of course,
you can go to the dark.

161
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,561
But they're in the dark, too.

162
00:29:43,229 --> 00:29:48,201
So tell me, Jardani.
What do you really want?

163
00:29:50,771 --> 00:29:52,140
Passage.

164
00:29:53,506 --> 00:29:54,976
Where did you want to go?

165
00:29:56,642 --> 00:29:58,512
Casablanca.

166
00:30:00,447 --> 00:30:03,517
The path to paradise
begins in hell.

167
00:30:09,023 --> 00:30:10,455
So be it.

168
00:30:10,457 --> 00:30:14,262
You hand me your ticket,
I will tear it.

169
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:17,532
If that's what
you really desire.

170
00:30:57,103 --> 00:31:00,507
With this, Jardani,
your ticket is torn.

171
00:31:10,249 --> 00:31:12,252
You can never come home again.

172
00:31:14,388 --> 00:31:15,790
Take him to the lifeboat.

173
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:18,658
<i>Do svidanya.</i>

174
00:31:21,594 --> 00:31:23,463
<i>Do svidanya.</i>

175
00:31:54,361 --> 00:31:57,465
Welcome to the Continental.
How may I help you?

176
00:32:15,782 --> 00:32:20,554
Sir. There is an Adjudicator
here to see you.

177
00:32:22,389 --> 00:32:23,491
Very well, sir.

178
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,696
The manager is in the lounge.

179
00:32:33,566 --> 00:32:37,468
I presume you're
here to discuss John Wick.

180
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:39,905
If that's so,
we can make this short.

181
00:32:39,907 --> 00:32:43,574
I told him to walk away,
he declined to do so.

182
00:32:43,576 --> 00:32:45,112
And that's the all of it.

183
00:32:45,912 --> 00:32:47,445
Mr. Wick broke the rules.

184
00:32:47,447 --> 00:32:49,714
Oh, yes.

185
00:32:49,716 --> 00:32:51,849
And I haven't got the
slightest idea where he is...

186
00:32:51,851 --> 00:32:53,217
You're mistaken.

187
00:32:53,219 --> 00:32:54,919
I'm not here for Mr. Wick.

188
00:32:54,921 --> 00:32:57,589
I'm here because Mr. Wick
broke the rules in this hotel.

189
00:32:57,591 --> 00:32:58,924
- Hmm.
- The blood was spilt

190
00:32:58,926 --> 00:33:01,392
on the grounds of
the Continental. Was it not?

191
00:33:01,394 --> 00:33:02,561
Oh, yes.

192
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,829
As a matter of fact,
the body gets colder

193
00:33:04,831 --> 00:33:06,764
within these very walls.

194
00:33:06,766 --> 00:33:09,169
I'd like to see it.

195
00:33:36,862 --> 00:33:39,798
Santino D'Antonio.

196
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,933
A newly instated member
of the High Table,

197
00:33:41,935 --> 00:33:42,868
slain by Mr. Wick

198
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:46,174
while seeking sanctuary
in the Continental.

199
00:33:50,343 --> 00:33:53,878
With a .45 ACP,
it appears.

200
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,814
I had no control
over Mr. Wick's actions.

201
00:33:56,816 --> 00:33:59,686
And yet, he lives
because you deemed it so, yes?

202
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:01,519
Yes.

203
00:34:01,521 --> 00:34:03,888
You have known Mr. Wick
for a great many years.

204
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:06,194
It might even be fair
to call you friends, yes?

205
00:34:07,427 --> 00:34:09,561
Instead of stopping him,
instead of killing him,

206
00:34:09,563 --> 00:34:11,495
you stood by
and let him walk away

207
00:34:11,497 --> 00:34:13,898
after he shot Santino
D'Antonio in front of you.

208
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,934
I made him Excommunicado.

209
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:18,903
But not before you gave
him an hour to escape.

210
00:34:18,905 --> 00:34:20,604
He broke the rules
in my hotel.

211
00:34:20,606 --> 00:34:23,274
This is exactly the
problem, your hotel.

212
00:34:23,276 --> 00:34:25,644
Where is your fealty?

213
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,812
I've been of service
for over 40 years.

214
00:34:27,814 --> 00:34:29,981
Under the Table.
Serving the Table.

215
00:34:29,983 --> 00:34:31,816
Everything is under the Table.

216
00:34:31,818 --> 00:34:33,550
I understand
that you have your loyalties,

217
00:34:33,552 --> 00:34:34,885
but this cannot be overlooked.

218
00:34:34,887 --> 00:34:38,555
Let me be clear.
I am here to adjudge you.

219
00:34:38,557 --> 00:34:40,397
You have one week
to get your affairs in order.

220
00:34:41,727 --> 00:34:42,894
Excuse me?

221
00:34:42,896 --> 00:34:45,733
At such time,
your successor will be named.

222
00:34:47,534 --> 00:34:49,066
There are rules,

223
00:34:49,068 --> 00:34:50,801
they are the only things
that separate us...

224
00:34:50,803 --> 00:34:53,338
- From the animals.
- Yes.

225
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,008
You have seven days.

226
00:34:58,811 --> 00:35:02,046
In the meantime, if you need any
assistance with your transition,

227
00:35:02,048 --> 00:35:04,916
you may look for me
in room 217.

228
00:35:04,918 --> 00:35:07,954
Enjoy your stay
at the Continental.

229
00:35:21,034 --> 00:35:23,637
There's an Adjudicator
here to see you.

230
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:40,885
Welcome to my Mission Control.

231
00:35:40,887 --> 00:35:44,421
Brain stem of my operation.
The information super flyway.

232
00:35:44,423 --> 00:35:46,691
From whence I control
the word on the street,

233
00:35:46,693 --> 00:35:47,892
the way of the world.

234
00:35:47,894 --> 00:35:49,426
With pigeons.

235
00:35:49,428 --> 00:35:53,401
Yes. You see rats with wings,
but I see the Internet.

236
00:35:54,668 --> 00:35:58,602
No IP addresses.
No digital footprint.

237
00:35:58,604 --> 00:36:02,407
Can't track it, can't hack it,
can't trace it.

238
00:36:02,409 --> 00:36:05,008
Can you get disease from it?

239
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:07,514
Well, I wouldn't recommend
that you eat one.

240
00:36:08,447 --> 00:36:10,582
What the hell do you want?

241
00:36:10,584 --> 00:36:12,550
I wanted to see
where it didn't happen.

242
00:36:12,552 --> 00:36:14,151
Where what didn't happen?

243
00:36:14,153 --> 00:36:15,922
Where you didn't kill
John Wick.

244
00:36:17,023 --> 00:36:18,122
I've always been
under the impression

245
00:36:18,124 --> 00:36:21,526
that contracts and
executing them was optional.

246
00:36:21,528 --> 00:36:23,531
I have no problem
with John Wick.

247
00:36:29,735 --> 00:36:33,405
And yet, you gave John
a seven-round Kimber 1911,

248
00:36:33,407 --> 00:36:34,939
knowing that
he intended to use it

249
00:36:34,941 --> 00:36:36,811
to stand against the Table.
Yes?

250
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,983
This Kimber 1911,
to be exact.

251
00:36:51,525 --> 00:36:53,124
You gave John Wick
seven bullets,

252
00:36:53,126 --> 00:36:55,959
the High Table
is giving you seven days.

253
00:36:55,961 --> 00:36:58,463
Seven days for what, exactly?

254
00:36:58,465 --> 00:36:59,731
To settle your affairs

255
00:36:59,733 --> 00:37:02,066
and find a new home
for your birds.

256
00:37:02,068 --> 00:37:04,638
In seven days,
you abdicate your throne.

257
00:37:16,916 --> 00:37:18,082
Oh, my dear.

258
00:37:18,084 --> 00:37:20,984
Tell me, do you know what
the Bowery is, Adjudicator?

259
00:37:20,986 --> 00:37:23,687
Do you know what happens
when I wave my hand?

260
00:37:23,689 --> 00:37:27,057
No, there will be no replacement
for me on the throne.

261
00:37:27,059 --> 00:37:29,727
Because I am the throne, baby.

262
00:37:29,729 --> 00:37:31,866
I am the Bowery!

263
00:37:33,133 --> 00:37:35,466
I am all that you deign
not to look at

264
00:37:35,468 --> 00:37:36,834
when you walk
down the street at night.

265
00:37:36,836 --> 00:37:40,707
The Bowery is mine.
Mine alone.

266
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,575
Do not make the mistake
of thinking

267
00:37:43,577 --> 00:37:46,945
you exist outside
the rules, no men do.

268
00:37:46,947 --> 00:37:48,782
You have seven days.

269
00:39:28,814 --> 00:39:30,184
Enough!

270
00:39:35,789 --> 00:39:38,756
I'm afraid our friend here
is off limits.

271
00:39:38,758 --> 00:39:41,725
But he's Excommunicado.

272
00:39:41,727 --> 00:39:44,264
It seems the manager
has granted him amnesty.

273
00:39:45,798 --> 00:39:47,198
Mr. Jonathan,

274
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,037
would you be so kind
as to come with me?

275
00:40:10,122 --> 00:40:13,291
Welcome to Casablanca,
Mr. Wick.

276
00:40:13,293 --> 00:40:15,296
Thanks.

277
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:21,365
Mr. Jonathan,

278
00:40:21,367 --> 00:40:23,267
it has been a long time
since our fine city

279
00:40:23,269 --> 00:40:25,072
has been graced
with your presence.

280
00:40:25,738 --> 00:40:26,970
I need to talk to...

281
00:40:26,972 --> 00:40:29,173
Yes, Ms. Al-Azwar,
she's expecting you.

282
00:40:36,215 --> 00:40:40,017
My, my, welcome
to the Moroccan Continental.

283
00:40:40,019 --> 00:40:41,921
I hope you'll find it
to your taste.

284
00:40:43,856 --> 00:40:45,122
Right this way.

285
00:40:45,124 --> 00:40:47,994
Ms. Al-Azwar,
she waits for no man.

286
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:56,803
Best of luck, Mr. Jonathan.
Best of luck.

287
00:41:31,438 --> 00:41:33,236
You a dog person, John?

288
00:41:33,238 --> 00:41:35,275
Sofia?

289
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,747
Sofia!

290
00:41:42,749 --> 00:41:45,149
You can't kill the bearer
of your marker.

291
00:41:45,151 --> 00:41:48,222
I didn't kill you.
I just shot you.

292
00:41:49,222 --> 00:41:50,390
Nice suit.

293
00:41:53,026 --> 00:41:54,758
Good to see you, too.

294
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,160
I should shoot you
in the head right now.

295
00:41:57,162 --> 00:41:58,698
I know.

296
00:42:03,936 --> 00:42:05,905
Don't you do it.

297
00:42:07,173 --> 00:42:09,841
You're Excommunicado, John.

298
00:42:09,843 --> 00:42:14,314
And that marker
doesn't mean shit.

299
00:42:19,418 --> 00:42:21,421
This is your blood.

300
00:42:22,454 --> 00:42:24,789
Your bond.

301
00:42:24,791 --> 00:42:29,363
When you needed help,
I was there.

302
00:42:37,336 --> 00:42:38,405
Sit.

303
00:42:42,342 --> 00:42:44,912
I was talking to you, John.

304
00:42:49,282 --> 00:42:54,017
You do realize that
I'm management now, right?

305
00:42:54,019 --> 00:42:55,952
I'm not service anymore, John.

306
00:42:55,954 --> 00:42:59,524
So I don't go around
shooting people in the head.

307
00:42:59,526 --> 00:43:02,160
I'm not asking you
to kill anyone.

308
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:04,495
I just need you
to get me to him.

309
00:43:04,497 --> 00:43:07,234
- To who?
- Your old boss.

310
00:43:09,235 --> 00:43:10,834
You want to kill Berrada.

311
00:43:10,836 --> 00:43:12,870
I'm not gonna kill him.
I just need to talk.

312
00:43:12,872 --> 00:43:15,309
What could he
possibly give to you?

313
00:43:17,943 --> 00:43:19,410
Guidance.

314
00:43:19,412 --> 00:43:24,282
Look, I made a deal when
I agreed to run this hotel.

315
00:43:24,284 --> 00:43:25,515
And that deal said

316
00:43:25,517 --> 00:43:28,419
that I had to follow
the rules of the Table.

317
00:43:28,421 --> 00:43:31,856
If you're not gonna kill him,
he is gonna kill you,

318
00:43:31,858 --> 00:43:35,392
and then probably me, too,
for walking you up in there.

319
00:43:35,394 --> 00:43:39,132
If I make one mistake,
one enemy...

320
00:43:40,432 --> 00:43:44,003
Maybe somebody goes
looking for my daughter.

321
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:48,407
And I know what you did,
John, to get her out.

322
00:43:49,843 --> 00:43:54,014
But that's not a chance
I can take. Sorry.

323
00:43:56,115 --> 00:43:58,318
Do you wanna know
where she is?

324
00:43:59,218 --> 00:44:02,320
No. I don't ever wanna know.

325
00:44:02,322 --> 00:44:05,224
Because I don't trust
that I won't go find her.

326
00:44:06,492 --> 00:44:10,595
A part of me longs for her.

327
00:44:10,597 --> 00:44:14,631
And I have to kill that part
of myself every day,

328
00:44:14,633 --> 00:44:16,302
just to keep her safe.

329
00:44:19,539 --> 00:44:26,611
Because sometimes you have
to kill what you love.

330
00:44:26,613 --> 00:44:29,412
That's why I gave you that
marker in the first place.

331
00:44:29,414 --> 00:44:31,314
That's why
I'm sitting here right now

332
00:44:31,316 --> 00:44:33,519
and that's why I'm fucked!

333
00:44:39,124 --> 00:44:41,260
- Consequences.
- Yeah.

334
00:44:43,162 --> 00:44:45,032
Consequences.

335
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:49,202
I'm just asking you to try.

336
00:44:50,269 --> 00:44:51,972
Either way, you and me,

337
00:44:52,505 --> 00:44:54,106
we'll be even.

338
00:45:05,184 --> 00:45:06,419
No.

339
00:45:07,586 --> 00:45:13,259
After this,
we are less than even.

340
00:45:17,262 --> 00:45:19,165
We leave in 10 minutes.

341
00:46:16,088 --> 00:46:17,356
How can I help you?

342
00:46:29,702 --> 00:46:32,205
I wasn't expecting
the High Table so soon.

343
00:46:34,573 --> 00:46:36,573
There is a task.

344
00:46:36,575 --> 00:46:38,709
It involves someone
who broke the rules

345
00:46:38,711 --> 00:46:40,113
and stood against the Table.

346
00:46:41,713 --> 00:46:44,280
John Wick, you mean.

347
00:46:44,282 --> 00:46:46,249
My students
have not been idle.

348
00:46:46,251 --> 00:46:49,486
John Wick and all
who've helped him.

349
00:46:49,488 --> 00:46:51,588
You've heard the stories
about him, of course.

350
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:54,325
Killed scores of men this
past week alone because of...

351
00:46:54,327 --> 00:46:56,662
A dog, a car.

352
00:46:57,597 --> 00:46:58,732
I'm familiar.

353
00:47:02,235 --> 00:47:03,736
And I'm interested.

354
00:47:05,204 --> 00:47:06,340
Very.

355
00:47:12,811 --> 00:47:15,748
Blowfish. Very fatal.

356
00:47:20,619 --> 00:47:21,721
No soy.

357
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:34,101
I have served,
I will be of service.

358
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:16,802
Stop!

359
00:49:23,441 --> 00:49:24,510
Out!

360
00:49:31,217 --> 00:49:34,551
The High Table and the Ruska
Roma have an understanding.

361
00:49:34,553 --> 00:49:37,620
Yes, and you helped John Wick.

362
00:49:37,622 --> 00:49:38,555
He had a ticket.

363
00:49:38,557 --> 00:49:41,425
But a ticket does not stand
above the Table.

364
00:49:41,427 --> 00:49:44,331
Your penance
will be paid in blood.

365
00:49:44,829 --> 00:49:45,831
Now...

366
00:49:48,733 --> 00:49:53,305
Hold out your helping hands
and pledge your fealty.

367
00:50:01,479 --> 00:50:06,753
I have served,
I will be of service.

368
00:50:29,642 --> 00:50:31,645
We're not going in
like the old days.

369
00:50:32,577 --> 00:50:35,012
It's just a conversation.

370
00:50:35,014 --> 00:50:38,885
Nothing's ever just
a conversation with you, John.

371
00:50:42,755 --> 00:50:44,291
Let's go.

372
00:51:08,447 --> 00:51:10,280
Sofia.

373
00:51:10,282 --> 00:51:12,916
Always so nice to see you.

374
00:51:12,918 --> 00:51:16,689
And the dogs, of course, how marvelous.
May I pet one?

375
00:51:17,689 --> 00:51:18,821
Certainly.

376
00:51:22,894 --> 00:51:24,764
Fantastic.

377
00:51:25,564 --> 00:51:28,332
Jonathan Wick.

378
00:51:28,334 --> 00:51:31,404
I had heard you had
made your way to our shores.

379
00:51:37,043 --> 00:51:38,876
Come along now.

380
00:51:38,878 --> 00:51:40,847
I am certain
we have much to discuss.

381
00:51:45,517 --> 00:51:49,889
I must admit, I am curious.
What brings you to my domain?

382
00:51:51,523 --> 00:51:52,756
Tell me.

383
00:51:52,758 --> 00:51:54,694
Do you come here to kill me?

384
00:51:56,961 --> 00:51:58,264
No.

385
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:11,644
Mr. Wick, do you know where
the word "assassin" comes from?

386
00:52:13,378 --> 00:52:16,682
People argue. "Assassin."

387
00:52:18,017 --> 00:52:21,821
<i>Hashasheen,</i>
followers of Hassan-i...

388
00:52:23,088 --> 00:52:25,891
Eaters of hashish.

389
00:52:27,425 --> 00:52:28,761
No, thank you.

390
00:52:30,363 --> 00:52:33,696
But others contend
it comes from <i>asasiyyun.</i>

391
00:52:33,698 --> 00:52:36,367
Meaning, "men who are faithful

392
00:52:36,369 --> 00:52:37,970
"and who abide
by their beliefs."

393
00:52:39,905 --> 00:52:42,472
You see that coin?

394
00:52:42,474 --> 00:52:45,908
The first coin ever minted
in this facility.

395
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:49,445
Next to it, the first marker.

396
00:52:49,447 --> 00:52:51,914
Not easy to track down,
believe me.

397
00:52:51,916 --> 00:52:53,450
Now, this coin, of course,

398
00:52:53,452 --> 00:52:56,620
it does not represent
monetary value.

399
00:52:56,622 --> 00:52:59,756
It represents
the commerce of relationships,

400
00:52:59,758 --> 00:53:03,028
a social contract in which
you agree to partake.

401
00:53:04,162 --> 00:53:05,898
Order and rules.

402
00:53:06,898 --> 00:53:08,865
You have broken the rules.

403
00:53:08,867 --> 00:53:12,035
The High Table
has marked you for death.

404
00:53:12,037 --> 00:53:14,070
Why would I allow you
to leave here alive,

405
00:53:14,072 --> 00:53:18,043
when your life has been
by your own actions, forfeit?

406
00:53:23,182 --> 00:53:25,051
I seek to make amends.

407
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:28,452
To pay for what I've done.

408
00:53:28,454 --> 00:53:31,990
I seek a meeting with the one
who sits above the Table.

409
00:53:36,561 --> 00:53:40,463
This dog,
I do so love it.

410
00:53:40,465 --> 00:53:43,402
Tell me, does it shed
a great deal?

411
00:53:46,037 --> 00:53:48,171
Occasionally.

412
00:53:48,173 --> 00:53:51,608
When I leave, you can tell
the Elder I'm coming.

413
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:52,943
And if he wants me dead...

414
00:53:52,945 --> 00:53:56,548
Then he will see to it that
your bones bleach under the sun.

415
00:53:57,550 --> 00:53:59,149
I see.

416
00:53:59,151 --> 00:54:01,488
And I would have provided him
with a choice.

417
00:54:08,827 --> 00:54:09,996
I am sorry, Mr. Wick.

418
00:54:11,697 --> 00:54:13,900
I cannot tell you
where to find the Elder.

419
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:18,801
You fail to understand.

420
00:54:18,803 --> 00:54:20,870
The Elder
is not a man you find.

421
00:54:20,872 --> 00:54:23,207
He can only choose
to find you.

422
00:54:23,209 --> 00:54:25,209
You wish to speak with him?

423
00:54:25,211 --> 00:54:28,745
Go to the edge of the
desert, look up.

424
00:54:28,747 --> 00:54:30,180
Canis Minor,

425
00:54:30,182 --> 00:54:33,684
the dog that followed Orion
through the sky.

426
00:54:33,686 --> 00:54:35,751
You follow the brightest star.

427
00:54:35,753 --> 00:54:38,187
Walk until
you are almost dead.

428
00:54:38,189 --> 00:54:40,957
Then, keep walking.

429
00:54:40,959 --> 00:54:43,026
When you are
on your last breath,

430
00:54:43,028 --> 00:54:47,000
he will find you...
Or he will not.

431
00:54:48,901 --> 00:54:50,537
I am grateful.

432
00:54:53,037 --> 00:54:54,541
Thank you, sir.

433
00:54:56,976 --> 00:54:59,845
Perhaps you were
not listening before.

434
00:55:03,115 --> 00:55:05,051
The social contract.

435
00:55:06,519 --> 00:55:07,954
The commerce of relationships.

436
00:55:09,255 --> 00:55:11,622
You have received
a great gift.

437
00:55:11,624 --> 00:55:12,859
I have hosted your friend.

438
00:55:13,959 --> 00:55:15,829
What do you offer in return?

439
00:55:20,099 --> 00:55:22,802
So soft and yet so fierce.

440
00:55:23,869 --> 00:55:25,872
I love it, this dog.

441
00:55:27,539 --> 00:55:28,738
I will keep it.

442
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:29,972
Excuse me?

443
00:55:29,974 --> 00:55:31,807
This will be my gift.

444
00:55:31,809 --> 00:55:34,311
This will be how
you show me your fealty.

445
00:55:34,313 --> 00:55:35,745
No.

446
00:55:35,747 --> 00:55:37,981
Surely it's the least
you can do.

447
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:39,952
No, you cannot keep my dog.

448
00:55:41,052 --> 00:55:42,588
Very well.

449
00:55:43,689 --> 00:55:45,024
Very well.

450
00:55:47,293 --> 00:55:48,892
Then I will kill it.

451
00:55:53,999 --> 00:55:55,966
I'm sorry, Sofia.

452
00:55:55,968 --> 00:55:58,104
This was for you to learn.

453
00:56:06,778 --> 00:56:07,880
Don't.

454
00:56:49,622 --> 00:56:51,758
Sofia. Don't.

455
00:56:56,695 --> 00:56:58,631
He shot my dog.

456
00:56:59,898 --> 00:57:01,298
I get it.

457
00:57:03,334 --> 00:57:05,804
We gotta go. Now.

458
01:03:41,432 --> 01:03:42,968
Here you go.

459
01:03:47,439 --> 01:03:50,240
You're gonna die, John.

460
01:03:50,242 --> 01:03:53,343
Whether out here
in this desert,

461
01:03:53,345 --> 01:03:56,048
or somewhere else
down the road.

462
01:03:57,615 --> 01:03:59,418
But you are gonna die.

463
01:04:14,698 --> 01:04:16,468
Consequences.

464
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:22,008
Consequences.

465
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:50,369
Better get going.

466
01:04:59,644 --> 01:05:01,113
Sofia.

467
01:07:41,972 --> 01:07:43,842
Okay.

468
01:07:49,046 --> 01:07:50,815
You made your point.

469
01:07:52,416 --> 01:07:54,285
You have earned my fealty.

470
01:07:55,352 --> 01:07:56,619
Matter of fact...

471
01:07:56,621 --> 01:07:58,521
I'm gonna shove so
much fealty up your ass

472
01:07:58,523 --> 01:08:00,390
it's gonna come
spilling out of your mouth.

473
01:08:00,392 --> 01:08:02,557
You had your chance.

474
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:05,595
Well, since you see it
that way,

475
01:08:05,597 --> 01:08:07,729
I guess it's time I told you

476
01:08:07,731 --> 01:08:11,733
to climb down off your High
Table and go fuck yourself.

477
01:08:11,735 --> 01:08:13,736
Duly noted.

478
01:08:13,738 --> 01:08:15,537
You gave John Wick
seven bullets,

479
01:08:15,539 --> 01:08:19,409
your penance will be paid
with seven cuts.

480
01:08:19,411 --> 01:08:21,914
Well, sometimes you gotta
cut a motherfucker.

481
01:08:25,750 --> 01:08:28,020
Avert your eyes,
my sweet.

482
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:31,857
The king is dead.

483
01:08:36,795 --> 01:08:38,731
Long live the king.

484
01:09:32,650 --> 01:09:33,818
Drink.

485
01:09:35,519 --> 01:09:39,590
Don't worry, your weapon
is still there. Please drink.

486
01:09:49,933 --> 01:09:54,035
My son, how have you
come to be so lost?

487
01:09:54,037 --> 01:09:55,506
Not lost.

488
01:09:56,573 --> 01:09:58,039
Looking for you.

489
01:09:58,041 --> 01:10:00,611
You think
I speak of your location?

490
01:10:02,013 --> 01:10:04,046
Never seen a man fight so hard

491
01:10:04,048 --> 01:10:06,050
to end up
back where he started.

492
01:10:13,857 --> 01:10:15,891
So tell me, Jonathan.

493
01:10:15,893 --> 01:10:17,862
Why do you wish to live?

494
01:10:18,595 --> 01:10:21,866
My wife, Helen.

495
01:10:24,201 --> 01:10:29,439
To remember her.
To remember us.

496
01:10:29,441 --> 01:10:32,044
So you seek to live
for the memory of love?

497
01:10:33,777 --> 01:10:35,981
At least a chance to earn it.

498
01:10:37,648 --> 01:10:41,918
I can give you one last chance
to earn a life.

499
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:43,989
However, it might not be
the life that you wish.

500
01:10:45,756 --> 01:10:47,623
Complete a task for us,

501
01:10:47,625 --> 01:10:49,758
and your Excommunicado
will be reversed.

502
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:51,961
The open contract closed,

503
01:10:51,963 --> 01:10:54,029
you would be permitted
to continue to live.

504
01:10:54,031 --> 01:10:57,132
Not free under the Table,
but bound to it.

505
01:10:57,134 --> 01:11:00,138
Doing what you do best
for the rest of your days.

506
01:11:04,608 --> 01:11:06,010
The choice is yours.

507
01:11:08,112 --> 01:11:10,546
Die here and now.

508
01:11:10,548 --> 01:11:13,518
Or continue to live
and remember through death.

509
01:11:30,902 --> 01:11:32,901
What must be done?

510
01:11:32,903 --> 01:11:36,004
The cost of your life
will be the death of others.

511
01:11:36,006 --> 01:11:38,710
The first of which will be
the man they call Winston.

512
01:11:39,811 --> 01:11:40,943
What?

513
01:11:40,945 --> 01:11:43,745
He has forgotten his fealty.

514
01:11:43,747 --> 01:11:46,215
Neither the open contract
nor the Excommunicado

515
01:11:46,217 --> 01:11:48,887
will be lifted
until you complete your task.

516
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:51,520
So if you wish to live,

517
01:11:51,522 --> 01:11:54,257
and if you wish to remember,

518
01:11:54,259 --> 01:11:56,094
this is the choice
you must make.

519
01:12:13,044 --> 01:12:15,046
I will serve.

520
01:12:17,115 --> 01:12:20,181
I will be of service.

521
01:12:20,183 --> 01:12:22,284
Very well, my son.

522
01:12:22,286 --> 01:12:24,287
Cast aside your weakness

523
01:12:24,289 --> 01:12:27,159
and reaffirm your fealty
to the table.

524
01:12:33,298 --> 01:12:34,765
Mr. John Wick.

525
01:12:35,751 --> 01:12:38,800
I want to see. Show me.

526
01:13:22,679 --> 01:13:24,015
Thank you.

527
01:13:25,316 --> 01:13:29,153
I accept this offering
and your fealty.

528
01:13:46,403 --> 01:13:49,305
I wish you good luck
on your path.

529
01:13:49,307 --> 01:13:52,110
Zahir will help you prepare
for your departure.

530
01:13:53,878 --> 01:13:55,046
And Mr. Wick.

531
01:14:00,001 --> 01:14:03,369
Welcome back.

532
01:14:34,751 --> 01:14:38,053
<i>JFK Express
now arriving on platform nine.</i>

533
01:14:38,055 --> 01:14:40,992
<i>JFK Express now arriving
on platform nine.</i>

534
01:16:03,907 --> 01:16:05,407
Stick together, kids.

535
01:16:05,409 --> 01:16:06,842
Make sure
you're holding the hand

536
01:16:06,844 --> 01:16:09,948
of the person
in front and behind you.

537
01:16:12,116 --> 01:16:15,420
You see? That's why
you're special, John Wick.

538
01:16:18,790 --> 01:16:20,459
I wouldn't have stopped.

539
01:16:21,959 --> 01:16:23,461
It's good to have you back.

540
01:16:30,367 --> 01:16:32,204
How was your trip?

541
01:16:34,938 --> 01:16:36,941
Going to the Continental?

542
01:16:43,046 --> 01:16:44,879
He with you?

543
01:16:44,881 --> 01:16:47,152
He was.

544
01:16:57,295 --> 01:16:58,961
Nice trick.

545
01:20:06,450 --> 01:20:09,153
Sir! Put your weapon down.

546
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:13,388
He's Excommunicado.

547
01:20:13,390 --> 01:20:15,660
Unless you wish
to become the same,

548
01:20:16,626 --> 01:20:20,162
I suggest you lower your gun.

549
01:20:26,137 --> 01:20:28,173
I'd like to see the manager.

550
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:32,641
Of course.

551
01:20:32,643 --> 01:20:35,347
If you would be so kind
as to follow me.

552
01:20:48,392 --> 01:20:50,159
Please take a seat.

553
01:20:50,161 --> 01:20:52,330
I will let him know
you have arrived.

554
01:21:27,098 --> 01:21:28,629
I gotta tell you,

555
01:21:28,631 --> 01:21:31,733
I've been looking forward to
meeting you for a long time.

556
01:21:31,735 --> 01:21:34,772
I'm a huge fan. John Wick.

557
01:21:37,174 --> 01:21:40,178
And so far,
you haven't disappointed.

558
01:21:43,546 --> 01:21:45,713
Is that the dog?

559
01:21:45,715 --> 01:21:48,150
He likes you.

560
01:21:48,152 --> 01:21:52,390
Me? I'm more of
a cat person myself.

561
01:21:52,822 --> 01:21:54,526
Hey, dog.

562
01:21:57,527 --> 01:22:01,696
We're the same, you know.
Both given the same gift.

563
01:22:01,698 --> 01:22:03,865
We're not the same.

564
01:22:03,867 --> 01:22:05,402
Yes, we are.

565
01:22:06,237 --> 01:22:08,870
No, we're not.

566
01:22:08,872 --> 01:22:11,440
The manager
is ready for you now.

567
01:22:11,442 --> 01:22:13,211
In the administrative lounge,
sir.

568
01:22:23,538 --> 01:22:26,500
We're both masters of death.

569
01:22:27,758 --> 01:22:29,358
Mr. Wick.

570
01:22:31,461 --> 01:22:32,496
Sit.

571
01:22:33,830 --> 01:22:35,299
Stay.

572
01:22:36,599 --> 01:22:37,701
Good dog.

573
01:23:33,790 --> 01:23:36,260
Tread carefully, Jonathan.

574
01:23:44,634 --> 01:23:48,302
We only use this room
on special occasions.

575
01:23:48,304 --> 01:23:52,373
When you simply have to see
what your opponent is holding

576
01:23:52,375 --> 01:23:53,842
under the table.

577
01:23:55,778 --> 01:23:57,915
How was your journey here?
Eventful?

578
01:23:59,015 --> 01:24:00,449
Yeah.

579
01:24:00,451 --> 01:24:02,618
Well, of course.

580
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:06,890
They sent men to kill you,
and now you to kill me.

581
01:24:08,025 --> 01:24:10,258
Isn't that why you're here?

582
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:14,765
I have served,
I will be of service.

583
01:24:16,767 --> 01:24:19,801
But you're having doubts.

584
01:24:19,803 --> 01:24:23,571
Just don't make the mistake of
pretending this is personal.

585
01:24:23,573 --> 01:24:25,543
If you feel you must,

586
01:24:27,945 --> 01:24:30,314
put a bullet through my heart.

587
01:24:36,820 --> 01:24:39,453
The High Table has asked me
to step down.

588
01:24:39,455 --> 01:24:40,824
The hour?

589
01:24:41,558 --> 01:24:42,591
The hour.

590
01:24:42,593 --> 01:24:44,996
You should have killed me
in the Continental.

591
01:24:46,362 --> 01:24:48,696
Maybe I should have.

592
01:24:48,698 --> 01:24:51,365
Rules and consequences.

593
01:24:51,367 --> 01:24:52,833
Hmm.

594
01:24:52,835 --> 01:24:54,435
It seems like everyone
is suffering

595
01:24:54,437 --> 01:24:56,805
from the consequences
of their actions.

596
01:24:56,807 --> 01:24:59,244
And you're not stepping down?

597
01:25:01,045 --> 01:25:02,580
No.

598
01:25:03,546 --> 01:25:05,513
I don't think I am.

599
01:25:05,515 --> 01:25:07,548
So it's war?

600
01:25:07,550 --> 01:25:09,687
You're going to war
with the High Table?

601
01:25:10,487 --> 01:25:11,819
Skirmish.

602
01:25:11,821 --> 01:25:12,921
Unless you decide to shoot me.

603
01:25:12,923 --> 01:25:16,728
But, then, I'd rather die
at the hand of a friend

604
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:19,961
than that of an enemy.

605
01:25:19,963 --> 01:25:22,733
No, I've made my choice.
It's up to you to make yours.

606
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:26,702
What choice?

607
01:25:26,704 --> 01:25:29,570
You shoot me,
you sell your soul.

608
01:25:29,572 --> 01:25:33,742
But I'll be alive.
And I can remember her.

609
01:25:33,744 --> 01:25:36,578
Until you die as a servant
of the High Table.

610
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:41,083
Now, you did the impossible,
you stopped, you got out.

611
01:25:41,085 --> 01:25:44,618
You only came back because
Helen was taken away from you.

612
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:48,592
The real question is,
who do you wish to die as?

613
01:25:48,991 --> 01:25:50,825
The Baba Yaga?

614
01:25:50,827 --> 01:25:52,961
The last thing
many men ever see?

615
01:25:52,963 --> 01:25:57,966
Or as a man who loved
and was loved by his wife?

616
01:25:57,968 --> 01:26:00,671
Who do you wish
to die as, Jonathan?

617
01:26:32,870 --> 01:26:35,803
Mr. Wick,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

618
01:26:35,805 --> 01:26:37,508
I am an Adjudicator.

619
01:26:38,942 --> 01:26:40,745
Have you decided to step down?

620
01:26:43,446 --> 01:26:46,148
I think not.

621
01:26:46,150 --> 01:26:49,420
And you? Will you be putting
a bullet in his head?

622
01:26:52,723 --> 01:26:55,827
No, I don't think I will.

623
01:27:03,634 --> 01:27:04,869
Very well.

624
01:27:13,110 --> 01:27:14,876
Administration.

625
01:27:14,878 --> 01:27:16,880
<i>I'd like to
change a designation.</i>

626
01:27:17,747 --> 01:27:18,913
Verification?

627
01:27:18,915 --> 01:27:22,150
<i>Adjudication 1-0-1-1-9-7-9.</i>

628
01:27:22,152 --> 01:27:24,218
The Continental Hotel,
New York.

629
01:27:24,220 --> 01:27:26,154
<i>New designation?</i>

630
01:27:26,156 --> 01:27:27,692
Deconsecrated.

631
01:27:30,561 --> 01:27:31,562
Processing.

632
01:27:33,964 --> 01:27:35,084
<i>Administrator.</i>

633
01:27:36,133 --> 01:27:40,705
<i>File. The New York
Continental Hotel.</i>

634
01:27:51,113 --> 01:27:55,620
The New York Continental Hotel
has been deconsecrated. Goodbye.

635
01:28:02,893 --> 01:28:05,526
Gentlemen, this institution
is now deconsecrated.

636
01:28:05,528 --> 01:28:08,195
Business may now be conducted
on Continental grounds.

637
01:28:08,197 --> 01:28:10,498
Since you are refusing
to step down

638
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:14,935
and you are refusing a direct
order, your lives are now forfeit.

639
01:28:14,937 --> 01:28:17,071
High Table emissaries will be
joining you presently

640
01:28:17,073 --> 01:28:19,777
to see the removal of
your souls from the property.

641
01:28:20,978 --> 01:28:22,980
Good evening, gentlemen.

642
01:28:27,049 --> 01:28:30,454
This haven is safe no more.

643
01:28:33,122 --> 01:28:35,893
Are services
still off limits to me?

644
01:28:36,727 --> 01:28:38,025
Under the circumstances,

645
01:28:38,027 --> 01:28:40,095
your privileges
are reinstated immediately.

646
01:28:40,097 --> 01:28:41,599
What do you need?

647
01:28:42,098 --> 01:28:45,535
Guns. Lots of guns.

648
01:29:03,719 --> 01:29:05,722
Let's make a withdrawal.

649
01:29:29,812 --> 01:29:31,212
Remember, sir.

650
01:29:31,214 --> 01:29:33,782
These will be
High Table forces.

651
01:29:33,784 --> 01:29:36,152
We may have to consider
our choices carefully.

652
01:29:36,853 --> 01:29:38,086
Why?

653
01:29:38,088 --> 01:29:39,823
Much has changed
during your time away.

654
01:29:40,656 --> 01:29:41,756
Like what?

655
01:29:41,758 --> 01:29:44,695
Well, let us say they have
made armor improvements.

656
01:29:52,702 --> 01:29:56,637
May I suggest
the 2011 Combat Master

657
01:29:56,639 --> 01:29:58,875
in combination with
the nine millimeter major.

658
01:30:10,353 --> 01:30:12,153
<i>Attention, all guests.</i>

659
01:30:12,155 --> 01:30:15,757
<i>The Continental Hotel
is closing for fumigation.</i>

660
01:30:15,759 --> 01:30:17,391
<i>We apologize
for the inconvenience.</i>

661
01:30:17,393 --> 01:30:19,563
<i>Please make your way
to the nearest exit.</i>

662
01:30:24,166 --> 01:30:27,002
<i>Attention, all guests.
The Continental Hotel...</i>

663
01:30:27,004 --> 01:30:30,704
It seems circumstances
have changed in your favor.

664
01:30:30,706 --> 01:30:32,239
Your transaction
may now be conducted

665
01:30:32,241 --> 01:30:33,945
on Continental grounds.

666
01:30:39,782 --> 01:30:42,984
We'll be sending some of our
finest for additional support.

667
01:30:42,986 --> 01:30:45,956
Cool. Very cool.

668
01:30:50,826 --> 01:30:55,763
125 grain,
1,425 feet per second.

669
01:30:55,765 --> 01:30:57,668
Serious business.

670
01:31:00,870 --> 01:31:02,236
Thank you.

671
01:31:02,238 --> 01:31:03,907
Let us begin.

672
01:32:50,213 --> 01:32:53,084
Charon, would you help set
the mood for our new guests?

673
01:32:53,983 --> 01:32:55,486
Of course, sir.

674
01:33:16,872 --> 01:33:19,541
I know you'll do
the Continental proud.

675
01:33:19,543 --> 01:33:21,211
I'll see you soon, sir.

676
01:33:24,214 --> 01:33:27,882
And you, Jonathan,
do what you do best.

677
01:33:27,884 --> 01:33:29,053
What's that?

678
01:33:29,585 --> 01:33:31,187
Hunt.

679
01:33:44,518 --> 01:33:46,686
If you want peace...

680
01:33:49,687 --> 01:33:51,600
Prepare for war.

681
01:37:04,634 --> 01:37:08,072
Winston! Winston!

682
01:37:12,174 --> 01:37:14,609
I need more firepower.

683
01:37:37,332 --> 01:37:39,300
Armor improvements.

684
01:37:39,302 --> 01:37:42,339
12-gauge steel slugs.
Armor-piercing.

685
01:41:06,526 --> 01:41:08,800
No one kills you but me.

686
01:41:09,745 --> 01:41:11,814
Only by my sword, John.

687
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:26,427
<i>I know you
believe you can keep this up.</i>

688
01:41:26,429 --> 01:41:27,627
<i>But I assure you...</i>

689
01:45:29,622 --> 01:45:33,858
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Wick.

690
01:45:34,859 --> 01:45:37,000
It's an honor to fight with you, Mr. Wick.

691
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:10,000
He is getting slow.

692
01:46:10,001 --> 01:46:12,500
He is been retired for 5 years.

693
01:46:12,501 --> 01:46:15,900
But he is still... John Wick.

694
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:19,700
We will see.

695
01:49:01,100 --> 01:49:03,202
Be seeing you.

696
01:49:32,848 --> 01:49:35,385
John, you're incredible.

697
01:49:36,317 --> 01:49:37,387
Exhausted,

698
01:49:37,987 --> 01:49:39,919
outnumbered...

699
01:49:39,921 --> 01:49:41,223
Obviously in pain.

700
01:49:42,424 --> 01:49:45,124
And you still beat
all of my students.

701
01:49:45,126 --> 01:49:47,030
If I didn't
have to kill you,

702
01:49:47,562 --> 01:49:50,065
we'd be pals.

703
01:49:50,532 --> 01:49:52,168
Let's do this.

704
01:50:19,929 --> 01:50:22,432
See? We're the same.

705
01:54:09,223 --> 01:54:11,792
I would like to suggest
a parley.

706
01:54:11,794 --> 01:54:13,526
A parley would be good.

707
01:54:13,528 --> 01:54:14,997
<i>Very well.</i>

708
01:54:26,140 --> 01:54:27,677
Are we in play, sir?

709
01:54:29,411 --> 01:54:30,680
Oh, very much so.

710
01:54:50,299 --> 01:54:51,801
Hey, John.

711
01:54:54,236 --> 01:54:56,572
That was
a pretty good fight, huh?

712
01:55:00,442 --> 01:55:01,644
Yeah.

713
01:55:31,272 --> 01:55:33,239
Yeah.

714
01:55:33,241 --> 01:55:36,709
Don't worry about me, John.

715
01:55:36,711 --> 01:55:38,814
I just gotta catch my breath.

716
01:55:40,715 --> 01:55:42,451
I'll catch up to you, John.

717
01:55:47,656 --> 01:55:49,592
No, you won't.

718
01:56:00,302 --> 01:56:01,368
You gentlemen, of course,

719
01:56:01,370 --> 01:56:03,636
realize that was
the first wave.

720
01:56:03,638 --> 01:56:06,239
Merely an amuse-bouche.

721
01:56:06,241 --> 01:56:07,774
We can keep this up
as long as you'd like,

722
01:56:07,776 --> 01:56:09,575
but it only ends one way.

723
01:56:09,577 --> 01:56:12,244
Are you sure a protracted war
is the best way forward?

724
01:56:12,246 --> 01:56:14,513
There won't be anything
"protracted" about it.

725
01:56:14,515 --> 01:56:15,748
Oh, you can take
the Continental,

726
01:56:15,750 --> 01:56:16,784
I have no doubt about that.

727
01:56:16,786 --> 01:56:19,452
But keeping it, that's
a different matter entirely.

728
01:56:19,454 --> 01:56:22,592
My allegiances run
way beyond this building.

729
01:56:23,491 --> 01:56:25,193
We are High Table.

730
01:56:25,693 --> 01:56:27,129
And we

731
01:56:28,263 --> 01:56:29,866
are New York City.

732
01:56:30,898 --> 01:56:32,602
Are we negotiating?

733
01:56:34,635 --> 01:56:35,670
Hmm.

734
01:56:36,405 --> 01:56:37,740
I believe we are.

735
01:56:43,545 --> 01:56:44,547
Parley?

736
01:56:45,479 --> 01:56:46,749
Parley.

737
01:56:50,352 --> 01:56:52,455
What do you propose we do?

738
01:56:56,592 --> 01:56:58,527
Let me keep my power.

739
01:56:58,994 --> 01:57:00,295
Under the Table.

740
01:57:03,264 --> 01:57:04,797
I have served

741
01:57:04,799 --> 01:57:07,734
and been a beacon
of order and stability

742
01:57:07,736 --> 01:57:09,868
to our industry
for over 40 years.

743
01:57:09,870 --> 01:57:12,471
Now, I humbly acknowledge
I overstepped

744
01:57:12,473 --> 01:57:15,378
and re-pledge my fealty
to the High Table.

745
01:57:17,713 --> 01:57:19,314
Winston.

746
01:57:24,853 --> 01:57:26,586
You were
merely showing strength

747
01:57:26,588 --> 01:57:29,192
so we would let you
keep the Continental.

748
01:57:32,661 --> 01:57:35,598
The High Table
accepts your fealty.

749
01:57:36,865 --> 01:57:38,334
But what about him?

750
01:57:40,469 --> 01:57:43,906
What are we going to do
about John Wick?

751
01:57:49,478 --> 01:57:51,247
Oh, he has to die.

752
01:57:52,680 --> 01:57:54,614
- Sorry, Jonathan.
- Winston!

753
01:57:54,616 --> 01:57:55,882
Don't see any other way.

754
01:58:07,763 --> 01:58:09,596
Very well, gentlemen.

755
01:58:09,598 --> 01:58:12,802
The Continental will now
be reconsecrated.

756
01:58:13,768 --> 01:58:15,637
Good day to you both.

757
01:58:19,674 --> 01:58:21,376
Well played, sir.

758
01:58:56,678 --> 01:58:59,678
How long do you estimate
until we reopen?

759
01:58:59,680 --> 01:59:01,450
Oh, should be no time at all.

760
01:59:05,454 --> 01:59:07,354
Mr. Wick is gone.

761
01:59:07,356 --> 01:59:09,055
A true tragedy.

762
01:59:09,057 --> 01:59:10,623
You misunderstand.

763
01:59:10,625 --> 01:59:13,626
I mean that he is no longer
on the street.

764
01:59:13,628 --> 01:59:14,793
That seems improbable.

765
01:59:14,795 --> 01:59:16,128
And yet, true.

766
01:59:17,598 --> 01:59:20,566
<i>I trust you understand the
repercussions if he survives.</i>

767
01:59:20,568 --> 01:59:22,836
<i>Both from above and below.</i>

768
01:59:22,838 --> 01:59:24,570
The last thing
either one of us needs

769
01:59:24,572 --> 01:59:26,808
is Mr. Wick paying us
a visit in the night.

770
01:59:29,745 --> 01:59:31,744
<i>For both our sakes,
I'll hope you see to it</i>

771
01:59:31,746 --> 01:59:34,012
that this situation
is taken care of, yes?

772
01:59:34,014 --> 01:59:37,719
Absolutely.
How far can he get?

773
01:59:49,531 --> 01:59:50,866
Baba Yaga.

774
02:00:03,644 --> 02:00:04,746
Mmm.

775
02:00:22,164 --> 02:00:24,696
How you doing, John?

776
02:00:24,698 --> 02:00:27,436
You look as bad as I feel.

777
02:00:29,137 --> 02:00:32,004
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny.

778
02:00:32,006 --> 02:00:34,477
Raise a hand
if you can hear me, John.

779
02:00:37,077 --> 02:00:40,012
Oh, shit.
They took a finger.

780
02:00:40,014 --> 02:00:42,617
Ain't that a bitch?

781
02:00:48,055 --> 02:00:52,057
Oh, John fucking Wick.

782
02:00:52,059 --> 02:00:54,761
So, the old boy
keeps his hotel

783
02:00:54,763 --> 02:00:56,162
and you take the fall.

784
02:00:56,164 --> 02:00:57,297
Can't say I blame him.

785
02:00:57,299 --> 02:00:59,802
I would've done the same thing
if I was in his shoes.

786
02:01:00,735 --> 02:01:03,505
But this High Table shit...

787
02:01:06,508 --> 02:01:08,110
Seven cuts.

788
02:01:11,745 --> 02:01:14,482
Under the Table
is where shit gets done.

789
02:01:16,183 --> 02:01:19,218
And they're about to find out,
if you cut a king,

790
02:01:19,220 --> 02:01:21,624
you better cut him
to the quick.

791
02:01:26,126 --> 02:01:27,629
So...

792
02:01:30,130 --> 02:01:31,901
Let me ask you, John.

793
02:01:32,567 --> 02:01:33,602
How do you feel?

794
02:01:36,103 --> 02:01:40,543
'Cause I am really pissed off.

795
02:01:41,175 --> 02:01:43,141
You pissed, John?

796
02:01:43,143 --> 02:01:44,610
Hmm?

797
02:01:44,612 --> 02:01:45,713
Are you?

798
02:01:55,557 --> 02:01:57,159
Yeah.

799
02:01:59,836 --> 02:02:04,836
