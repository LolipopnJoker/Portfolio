1
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,890
Come on. Get your coat.
We gotta go.

2
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,896
-You have everything?
-Yeah.

3
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,107
Hurry up, sweetie. We're late.

4
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,614
Ty. Today, papí.

5
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:41,743
You're killing me, Ty.
Right now, you're killing Mommy.

6
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:44,288
-Okay, let's go.
-It's not my fault, Mom.

7
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,419
All right. You want to do
your speech for me?

8
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,921
Ty! Hello? That's better.

9
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,257
You don't have to listen
to that 24 hours a day.

10
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,259
Wait. It's Simon and Garfunkel.

11
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,596
That's why I tell you to tie your shoes.
I know. I'm sorry. Oh, my God.

12
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,974
-You can't just turn them off, Mom.
-I understand, baby. Come on.

13
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,735
-Careful of the puddle.
-Why'd they break up?

14
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,987
-Who?
-Simon and Garfunkel.

15
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:20,949
You got me.
You can Google it at school.

16
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,126
Let's go.

17
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,925
Will I get in trouble
if I didn't give my speech?

18
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,635
Because I'm not really feeling it.

19
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:42,846
What do you mean? You've been
working all summer on that speech.

20
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,432
-I can't wait to hear it.
-It's boring.

21
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,144
Not to me or to abuela
or to your dad.

22
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,438
I thought we were meeting him after.

23
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:55,943
No way. He's coming, and then you
guys are going camping. Remember?

24
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,820
He's gonna be late,
and then everyone will see.

25
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:04,952
Look, he knows what time it starts.
Don't worry, he'll be there.

26
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,249
-Hey, look at me.
-What?

27
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,960
-You got something on your face there.
-Where?

28
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:15,629
-Right there.
-Ma! Mom! Mom, no! Stop!

29
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,881
There it is. I got it!

30
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:26,974
-Hey, guys. How's it going?
-Hey, Ty.

31
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:30,644
What's up?
The speech thing is at 4:00.

32
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,689
I know. Come here.
You got something on your face.

33
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,482
-Mom!
-What?

34
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:40,028
-Please.
-I'm sorry. Mr. Cool Guy.

35
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,156
I love you.

36
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,620
Have a good day.

37
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,594
-Morning, Marisa.
-What's up, Cora? How my diamonds?

38
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:49,723
-They're hanging with your rubies.
-I like the sound of that.

39
00:05:56,814 --> 00:06:00,233
-Just made it, Marisa.
-I always do.

40
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:21,505
-Good morning, Marisa.
-What's up, Keef?

41
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:25,759
How's the weather?
Sunshine. That's nice.

42
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,469
Anything good on?

43
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:35,018
He opened the door for the paper.
The wife just pushed him out.

44
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:38,563
That nasty butt first thing
in the morning, I'd kick him out too.

45
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,275
Oh, my God. Wait a minute. He's
one of mine, the lactose intolerant.

46
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,236
I like how you name the people.

47
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,364
What do you call me
behind my back, I wonder.

48
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:53,703
Yeah. Can I get a robe to the
Charles Suite ASAP? Thank you.

49
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,832
I call you God because you see
everything and you still smile.

50
00:06:56,999 --> 00:07:02,129
-I'm cool with that. I surely am.
-I'll see you later, Keef.

51
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:08,844
A Beresford maid is expedient.
A Beresford maid is thorough.

52
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,012
A Beresford maid serves with a smile.

53
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,391
And above all, a Beresford maid
strives to be invisible.

54
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,936
Maybe we can disappear
one day altogether.

55
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,899
You know what I just heard?

56
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:26,111
Christina? History after the 1st.

57
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,822
Christina kitchen or
Christina assistant manager?

58
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,991
Assistant manager.
You know what that means?

59
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,577
Somebody else is gonna be
busting my ass on the 2nd.

60
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:36,204
Wrong. It means we're gonna
need an assistant manager.

61
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:41,376
-Yo, Barb, we still on for happy hour?
-Ten hours and counting.

62
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,794
Hey, Marisa, you here?

63
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,130
Can I finish getting dressed,
please? Thank you.

64
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,716
You're the one who keeps
talking about being a manager.

65
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:51,178
All I'm saying is, it could be you.

66
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,138
They're not gonna make
a maid a manager.

67
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,600
Why not? Today's a new day.
Anything's possible.

68
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,560
You know what I'm saying?

69
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,364
Friday morning, people!
Lots to do. Heads up.

70
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:16,870
Mr. Bextrum has an announcement
to make. Mr. Bextrum.

71
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:21,082
Christina Howard's promotion created
a vacancy that we've decided to fill...

72
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,044
...with in-house personnel.

73
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,506
-Perhaps one of our butlers.
-Excuse me, Mr. Bextrum, sir?

74
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:32,093
-Yes, Miss Kehoe?
-Can a maid apply?

75
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:36,431
Technically, if an employee's been
here for three consecutive years...

76
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,101
...he or, indeed, she,
is qualified to apply.

77
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:44,814
So yes. Sure. Absolutely.
Why not? Anything is possible.

78
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:48,026
You hear that?
The man said anything's possible.

79
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,403
Yeah, I guess he did.

80
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,114
On to new business.

81
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:58,662
Mr. Radcliff is checking out of 709.
Mr. Greenwald is checking in.

82
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:02,290
He's back on the wagon,
so let's clear out the minibar.

83
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,794
Kanga CFO, Mr. Fukimoro,
is checking into 814.

84
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:10,090
Stock Evian, shampoo the rugs
and extra slippers for his guests.

85
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,968
Marisa, heads up
on the Madison Suite.

86
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,678
Housekeeping.

87
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,055
Mrs. Sage is arriving
with the children...

88
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,517
...preferably after Mr. Sage's
girlfriend departs.

89
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,811
You son of a bitch!

90
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,689
Let's make sure it's
a smooth transition.

91
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:28,733
The Guedj sisters are back.
We'll track them on surveillance...

92
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,821
...but do keep an eye on all
bathrobes, cutlery and light fixtures.

93
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,741
Sotheby's director, Caroline Lane,
has switched from the Four Seasons.

94
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,618
She requested a park view...

95
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:42,497
...and favors purple orchids
and lavender scents.

96
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,667
Assemblyman Chris Marshall
arrives today.

97
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,294
He's gearing up his campaign...

98
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:50,005
...so his suite will be doubling
as a conference centre...

99
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:53,842
...with the liquor and coffee bars
turning over every four hours.

100
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:58,430
And he's bringing his large dog,
so we'll need proper accouterments.

101
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:02,392
And finally, Mr. Newman is back
in the Sherman Suite.

102
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,396
Careful, ladies, he's a full Monty.

103
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:13,194
-I had no idea anyone was here.
-Don't worry about it, Mr. Monty.

104
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,030
No big deal.

105
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:19,200
-And I do mean no big deal.
-No big deal.

106
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,959
Lavender!

107
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,504
-You're very creative, Marisa.
-Thank you, ma'am.

108
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:36,051
Since you have to leave at 3:00,
go find Lionel and have him sign off.

109
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:42,807
-Sir, I need you to sign off on the--
-Damn!

110
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:46,394
Oh, good Lord. Here, let me.

111
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:49,147
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

112
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,691
Oh, God. Your hand's bleeding.

113
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,571
Here. Squeeze tight.

114
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:05,580
Damn. He's checked in.

115
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,625
Quote, "Sentimental favorite
Chris Marshall...

116
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:09,876
...blah, blah, blah...

117
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,754
...son of late Senator
Graham Marshall, blah, blah...

118
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:16,091
...is expected to run for his father's
seat in the next election."

119
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,802
-End quote.
-Let me see that. Let me see it, Jerry.

120
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,929
You don't need to see it. No.

121
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,140
-Give it here.
-Fine. But I hadn't finished it yet.

122
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,227
"Sentimental favorite
and playboy politico...

123
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,730
...Assemblyman Chris Marshall...."
Guess you missed a few words, Jer.

124
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,482
What, "playboy"?
That's a compliment.

125
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,486
"Who called off his engagement
to über babe Daniella Van Graas...

126
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,906
...arrives in town solo."
Respectful, huh?

127
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:44,244
Well, listen, you know, you're
a public figure. It's news. So what?

128
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,663
We were never engaged.
Whose side are you on?

129
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,457
Yours. That's why sometimes
you have to listen to me.

130
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,918
-Every now and again it might be nice.
-Here.

131
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,878
Welcome to the Beresford,
Mr. Marshall.

132
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,130
-Hello.
-My name is Lionel.

133
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:56,631
-Lionel?
-I'm the floor butler.

134
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,008
If there's anything you need,
please call me.

135
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:03,012
Thank you. This is Jerry,
and this is Dan, and the dog is Rufus.

136
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,265
Thank you, Lionel.
Nice to meet you. Thanks.

137
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:08,852
We'll call you if we need you. Chris,
will you look at me, please? Chris?

138
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,730
-Can you look at me for a minute?
-What? I am looking at you.

139
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,190
We're going to Maddox's thing
on Monday night.

140
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,442
No, Jerry, we're not.

141
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:18,695
See, this is when I wish your
old man were here to back me up.

142
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,488
-What?
-I said, I wish your old man...

143
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,575
-...were here to back me up.
-My father had no use for that man.

144
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,911
Your father knew how
to use that man.

145
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,122
-Where are you going?
-What?

146
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,333
-That depends. Where are you going?
-Bathroom. Alone.

147
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,586
-Yeah. Fine. Go. Great. Yeah. Sure.
-Thank you.

148
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,880
Call me if you need anything.

149
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,053
Oh, my God. I'm sorry, sir.

150
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,185
Thank you.

151
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,700
Sir.

152
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,662
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I'm so clumsy.

153
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,332
-Happens to all of us. Here.
-Thank you.

154
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,501
-Let me help you.
-Thank you.

155
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,671
-Where do those go?
-Caroline Lane. Park Suite.

156
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,217
She just checked in with a request
for immediate unpack and press.

157
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:25,386
Here. Blood and Dolce:

158
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:30,767
Thank you. Thank you.

159
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,395
I mean, there are limits.

160
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:40,235
You're so bad. You really are, Rach.

161
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,071
Yes, just hold on a second.

162
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:46,032
Thank you. Anything, I mean,
it's up and down.

163
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,244
One day, we're looking at rings,
and the next day, we're breaking up.

164
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:52,121
Yeah. No way.

165
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,123
So I...

166
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:59,963
...had my assistant accidentally forward
my calendar for the week to his e-mail.

167
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:05,677
Of course, I added a few extra lunch
dates and dinner parties with my ex.

168
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,137
Fantastic, right?

169
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:12,100
Eric will be furious.

170
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:15,311
-That needs pressing.
-Okay.

171
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:19,065
But let's not forget Eric trades
commodities for a living.

172
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:23,778
A little competition right now
might increase my market value.

173
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,992
Listen, my darling, I'm going
to be late. I'll call you later, okay?

174
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,661
Excuse me. Sorry.

175
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:35,665
Could you just hold up those two
outfits that Dolce sent over earlier?

176
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,127
These two?

177
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:44,257
Well, I just simply can't tell
without the stockings.

178
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:48,469
Could I ask you an enormous favor?

179
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:53,683
I mean, I know this isn't your job,
and I'd never normally ask, but I'm so....

180
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:57,061
-It's okay.
-You're such a doll.

181
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,273
Would you run down to Madison
and get me three pairs of pantyhose?

182
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:04,110
-The concierge usually does that.
-Yes, but it will get lost in translation.

183
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,654
Please. You look like
you're someone...

184
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,824
...who knows the difference
between taupe and caramel.

185
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:14,162
-Okay.
-Thanks.

186
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,832
Here. Thank you so much.

187
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,084
-Okay.
-Oh, and sorry.

188
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:23,254
Can you send someone else
to finish the unpacking, please?

189
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,506
-Right away.
-Thanks.

190
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,342
Bye.

191
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:30,094
Attention! Somebody's coming!

192
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:35,224
-You think it's gonna rain?
-Maybe. It's possible.

193
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,768
-Hi, where's the fire?
-Nowhere.

194
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,020
I just got sent on an errand.
I'm already late.

195
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,481
-Get these pressed for me?
-Sure, in my spare time.

196
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,483
By the way, two poodles
raiding your cart.

197
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:44,859
-What?
-Can't be late for Ty!

198
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:56,287
Mary Anne, if you don't wear
that dress, I'm gonna come over.

199
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,791
I'm gonna go in your closet.
I'm gonna put it on for you.

200
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,377
Wait. Hold on a sec.

201
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,879
Excuse me, miss?
Where are you going?

202
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,382
-In back to see if Carrie's here.
-Carrie's not here.

203
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,217
So could you just step away?

204
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,593
Away.

205
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,721
Away. Away from there.
Thank you.

206
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:17,392
Hi. Sorry. Okay, so you go first.

207
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,812
No, you! No, you.

208
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,605
Get out.

209
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:26,234
-Get out.
-Excuse me, just a moment.

210
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,528
You know what? I have customers,
so go on quick.

211
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,906
Yeah. Then what?

212
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,574
No, he didn't.

213
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,910
-No, he didn't.
-Can I just ask you one question?

214
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:40,957
You know what, ma'am?
You have to wait. Okay?

215
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,752
What? No, a maid.

216
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,546
-I don't know.
-Yo.

217
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,840
-You can't be back here.
-Leezette?

218
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,591
What are you doing?

219
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,261
Being that we're sisters
in the service business...

220
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,595
...and I'm in a rush...

221
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,390
...I'd say you start serving
your low-end customers...

222
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,475
...because that's
the reason you're here.

223
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,437
Unless we're not good enough
for you to service.

224
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:05,064
In which case,
I'm sure your manager is.

225
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,442
What do you say, ladies?
Am I right or am I right?

226
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,902
-You're right.
-Oh, yes.

227
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,450
-Sorry, Mom.
-Baby, where were you?

228
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:16,743
Keef, do me a favor.

229
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,661
These go to the goddess
in the Park Suite.

230
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:22,123
-I got you. Don't forget the bags.
-Thank you.

231
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,583
Are you ready?

232
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:26,753
-I'm not gonna have time to change.
-Sure you do. We'll be a little late.

233
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,672
No, Ma, we cannot be late, okay?

234
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,466
-Come on.
-I was on time.

235
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,761
Are they here yet?

236
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,238
-Hello?
-Marisa?

237
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,492
Yeah. Marcus. Yeah.

238
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,243
No, I can't hear you.

239
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,413
-When's Ty's speech again?
-I'll get it.

240
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,832
In 20 minutes, at 4:00.

241
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,543
-And you cannot be late.
-Well....

242
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,295
Marcus!

243
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,216
-You're just breaking up. What?
-I can't be there. I'm in Miami.

244
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:16,094
-Please tell me you're kidding.
-I'm in Miami with Mugsy.

245
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,513
Don't do this to me, Marcus.

246
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,724
Don't let him get away with it.
Be strong, Marisa.

247
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,185
What am I supposed
to tell him this time?

248
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,145
-This weekend is the holiday.
-I know.

249
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,523
-He's counting on it.
-He'll get over it.

250
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,026
-I'll take him at Christmas, okay?
-Tell somebody who believes you.

251
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,195
I gotta go.

252
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,865
That shit.

253
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:41,536
This fell out of your bag. Is it yours?

254
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,414
Yeah, thanks.

255
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,876
Management, huh?

256
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,045
Que fancy.

257
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,633
What?

258
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:57,927
I'm not saying a word.

259
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:01,097
Can you not say a word
somewhere else?

260
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:06,561
And our next speaker
will be Ty Ventura.

261
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,880
Richard Milhous Nixon...

262
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:39,802
...was a man
of many contradictions.

263
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:44,640
Even though
he is remembered in history...

264
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:48,269
...as the only president
to ever resign...

265
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:56,652
...his foreign policies
and his relations with China...

266
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:01,115
...opened up the Western door
to Eastern--

267
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:05,286
I mean, Eastern door
to Western ties.

268
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,288
That's enough.

269
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:12,126
Born a Quaker,
he was nevertheless....

270
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:16,881
He was responsible for bombing...

271
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,968
...for the violent bombing of....

272
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:26,974
Richard Nixon was born in....

273
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,168
Hey, baby.

274
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:01,008
They were all laughing at me,
and then I lost my words.

275
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:04,220
You know, it happens
sometimes, honey.

276
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,640
I never want to do that again, okay?

277
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,687
You're going to do better next time.

278
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,522
No.

279
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,152
All right, we'll talk about it later...

280
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,199
...because I got something for you.
The new Nixon tapes.

281
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:32,081
Come on, you know
you wanna open it.

282
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,169
Mom.

283
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,756
Oh, papí.

284
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,383
I'm sorry.

285
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,055
Where's Dad?

286
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,643
He had a construction job
in Poughkeepsie.

287
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,730
It was paying time and a half,
and he had to do it, baby.

288
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,482
It's okay.

289
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:02,653
So you'll hang out with me
at the hotel this weekend, okay?

290
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,416
A married guy was buying
clothes for his girlfriend.

291
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,752
I know. He gave me
his number yesterday.

292
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,920
-What's up, Frannie, Michelle?
-Good morning.

293
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:23,257
-Hey, Ty, how are you?
-What's up, Ty?

294
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,678
Lily?

295
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,805
We're here.

296
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:34,060
Hey, are you going to keep me
company today, Ty?

297
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,103
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

298
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:41,525
Now, he's got books and puzzles
and all kinds of fun stuff. Right, baby?

299
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:47,281
-I'm on 22 if you need me, okay?
-Okay.

300
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,117
So I'll see you at lunchtime.

301
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,454
You all right?

302
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:56,665
I'm cool.

303
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:03,464
You know, I am really sorry
about all this.

304
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,676
It's not your fault.

305
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,432
-See you later. Thank you.
-Sure.

306
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:18,979
What's with the face?

307
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:22,483
He's a kid. He has
a whole hotel to play with.

308
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,985
-We come here every day.
-He'll have a ball.

309
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,320
You said it.

310
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:30,282
-You need to loosen up.
-I'm not interested.

311
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,159
-Why are you stealing my tissues?
-I need them.

312
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:36,997
While you're there, get me soap,
shower caps, some Kiehl's.

313
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:41,669
We need some fun in our lives.
Be spontaneous, kick up our skirts.

314
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,005
-The expression is "heels."
-Maybe for you.

315
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:47,133
-I'm with you, girl.
-You only live once.

316
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,718
-You know. Come on.
-No.

317
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,389
Live it, girl.

318
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:56,684
I'm living.

319
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,980
Come on, help me clean the
Park Suite. You're not doing nothing.

320
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,944
Oh, sorry. Aren't you
the maid I had yesterday?

321
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:10,030
-Yes, ma'am.
-Oh, fantastic. I need another favor.

322
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:11,949
I'm late for lunch,
otherwise I'd do it.

323
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:16,078
Would you run down to the boutique
and return the outfits in the closet?

324
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,873
-Sure, I'll take care of it.
-Thank you. You're the best.

325
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,583
Okay.

326
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,877
-Who's she?
-She's the goddess.

327
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:25,880
She's staying in the Park Suite.
You two have a lot in common.

328
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:28,507
Yeah? Then why am I the one
wearing the uniform?

329
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:31,093
What I meant was
that she also has a boyfriend...

330
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:34,180
...who she's been with for a while,
who still has not popped--

331
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:36,974
Her cherry?
Because then we'd be identical.

332
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:41,061
-What are you looking at?
-I meant the question.

333
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,564
My God, is your mind always...

334
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,941
...on the pepperoni?

335
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:48,360
That's right, baby.

336
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:01,916
All right, here's the difference
between me and the goddess.

337
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,585
She's playing games
to trick him into wanting her--

338
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,505
-And you're what?
-I'm working hard for the money.

339
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:11,550
Speaking of which, you hand
in your application? Management?

340
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,219
Yeah.

341
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,097
What are you doing?

342
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:21,602
-Dolce, nice.
-No, no, come on, get out of there.

343
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,772
I'm just taking a little peek.
They're going back anyway.

344
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,565
You're gonna get us in trouble.

345
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,984
Hello, ladies.

346
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,945
Leave that stuff alone. Come on.

347
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:33,155
You're supposed to be
helping me out in here.

348
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,616
Feel this material.

349
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,702
I mean, it's like butter.

350
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,123
Oh, my God.

351
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:46,210
This stuff is $5000.

352
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:50,005
For one white outfit?
How do you keep it clean?

353
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,340
Scotchgard.

354
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,467
Oh, yeah.
They're a 6, you're a 6.

355
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,803
What are you doing?
What are you doing?!

356
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,972
And shoes too.

357
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:00,474
Shoes. Size 9. Perfect.

358
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,309
-I'm a 7 1/2.
-Which means you're an 8.

359
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:05,479
Just put on some gym socks,
you're good to go.

360
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:08,774
That's it. Put this stuff back.
What are you doing?

361
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,317
Not until you try it on.

362
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:12,486
I can't try on her clothes!

363
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:17,116
They're not hers. They're not Dolce's.
Technically, they've been abandoned.

364
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,285
Let's not let them hear us.

365
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:20,452
Who, the clothes?

366
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,079
Marisa Ave Maria Ventura...

367
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:26,333
...when will you or I ever get
to try on a $5000 anything?

368
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:32,339
Come on, feel how
the other half feels, huh?

369
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,802
Hey, Lily, what are you doing?

370
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:40,681
Hey. I'm sewing on a button.

371
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,267
What's the cook making for lunch?

372
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:47,146
Saturday, you'll have
mac and cheese.

373
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,695
Where you going?

374
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,947
Around. I'll be right back.

375
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:00,409
-Stay close, okay?
-Okay.

376
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:01,952
Rufus.

377
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,538
Rufus, come here.
Come here. Sit.

378
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,040
-Where are you going?
-For a walk.

379
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:08,792
No, there's a League of Women Voters
lunch downstairs.

380
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,045
-We should do a drive-by.
-A quick pit stop?

381
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,713
Yeah, in and out.
Leave them laughing.

382
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,382
-Hey, Jer, quick question. Be honest.
-Sure thing.

383
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,509
Do I look as stupid
as you think I am?

384
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:20,387
No. I mean, you're not stupid.
What are you talking about?

385
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:22,264
-Come on.
-Where are you going? No.

386
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:24,391
You have a problem
with the ladies' lunch?

387
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,102
I have a problem trying to upstage
Victor Delgado. Remember him?

388
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:31,315
The guy running against me for Senate,
scheduled to speak downstairs?

389
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,067
He's not speaking until 1:30.

390
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:43,535
I know this offends your sense
of fairness, but I'd like to win.

391
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,704
-You don't give up.
-No, of course not.

392
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:48,916
That's why you hired me.
Look, you go to the luncheon, okay?

393
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:52,544
You go to Maddox's thing on Monday.
"Hello," "goodbye," you're home free.

394
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,922
Define "free."

395
00:27:56,424 --> 00:28:00,302
Look, they have people who will
walk your dog for you.

396
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,389
-I mean, I know that's a crazy idea.
-I want to walk my own dog.

397
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:05,557
Relax. You're starting
to lose your hair.

398
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:09,269
He's friendly.

399
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,939
-His name is Rufus.
-Hey, Rufus.

400
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,316
So, what are you listening to?

401
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:20,781
-The Best of Bread.
-Best of Bread? Interesting.

402
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,783
What's your name?

403
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:26,829
-Ty.
-Nice to meet you, Ty. I'm Chris.

404
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:28,914
I'm bald and no one in particular.

405
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,249
I know who you are.

406
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,127
Yeah? What do you know?

407
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:36,338
I know that you're
the state assemblyman.

408
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,882
I know you're thinking
of running for senator.

409
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,428
I know your voting record and
your stand on environmental causes.

410
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,138
Great.

411
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:47,474
-Look, I hate to interrupt, but--
-Are you Republican?

412
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,269
Yes.

413
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,603
Why?

414
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:53,564
Richard Nixon was Republican.

415
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:54,982
So what?

416
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,984
-He lied.
-So, what does that mean?

417
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,652
Nothing.

418
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:01,363
Who told you to ask
these questions?

419
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:02,948
Nobody.

420
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,826
What press are you affiliated with?

421
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:07,369
I'm 10.

422
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,288
Your parents?
Democrat or Republican?

423
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:11,999
-What's the difference these days?
-I love this kid.

424
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,042
Well, what's not to love?

425
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:16,670
-Where you going?
-I'm gonna walk Rufus.

426
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:20,507
What, are you writing a book?
In 10 minutes, okay?

427
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,634
-One pee.
-If Mom says okay, can I come?

428
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:24,762
-What?
-If my mom says okay, can I come?

429
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:28,140
-Sure. Where's your mom?
-Back on 22. Park Suite.

430
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,309
No, you know what, Chris?
You're in a hurry.

431
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:33,812
-He doesn't have time.
-No, he's in a hurry. I'm fine.

432
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,189
-You take him.
-What?

433
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:37,357
I'll go up with you.
I forgot his ball anyway.

434
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:39,860
I don't want to-- Wait!

435
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,657
Hold on!

436
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:52,247
Hi, honey. It's Ty!

437
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,458
What are you doing up here?

438
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,667
Where's Mom?

439
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,215
It's for you, ma'am.

440
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:03,050
What are you talking about?
Ty, don't you--?

441
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:06,553
Hey, Ma, this is Chris. He's got
a giant grey dog named Rufus.

442
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:10,432
And if you say okay,
I'm gonna go walk with him, okay?

443
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,559
-Hello.
-Hi.

444
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:16,772
Let's not forget. I'm a kid and I need
fresh air. Please, can I go, Mom?

445
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,857
I'm Chris Marshall.

446
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,734
Caroline...

447
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:22,903
...you want your coat?

448
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,864
-What?
-The weather can be so tricky here.

449
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:27,908
Weren't you saying
what a beautiful day it was?

450
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,743
Oh, you're going out?

451
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,788
Weren't you saying how you
wanted to stretch your legs?

452
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,249
Well, if your husband
wouldn't mind....

453
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,709
She doesn't have a husband.

454
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:40,295
-I don't have a husband.
-I insist, then.

455
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:42,297
-Come with us, if you're free.
-Yeah.

456
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:44,424
-Come on, Mom.
-Here we go.

457
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:46,385
I can't.

458
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:50,264
-Put these on.
-The shoes are too big.

459
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:52,766
Have a good time. Have fun.

460
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:57,312
-Come on, Ty, let's go find Rufus.
-Come on, Mom.

461
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,107
Mr. Marshall, John Bextrum,
hotel manager.

462
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,441
This is fun.

463
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:04,278
-So be cool, okay?
-Okay.

464
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:06,405
What's this?

465
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,615
If that slips out again,
tuck it in for me.

466
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:11,285
And the night before.
You're not answering your pager.

467
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:13,579
-Really? I never got the message.
-Really?

468
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:15,038
You said you'd take us to Niketown.

469
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,624
Well, here, I'll go down with you.

470
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,466
Beautiful ensemble.

471
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,635
How does she keep it clean?

472
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:30,012
Scotchgard?

473
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,472
You think that's the new girlfriend?

474
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:33,849
For tonight.

475
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,478
Ladies, would you like to join us?

476
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,230
Pig!

477
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,149
Au revoir.

478
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,817
Bye-Bye.

479
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,652
Bye.

480
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,701
Come on, Rufus, just pee
because I have stuff to do.

481
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:56,538
-Pee! Lift your leg.
-Jerry Siegel, is that you?

482
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,665
Hey, Maddox, how are you?
Small world.

483
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,083
You know Victor Delgado.

484
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,920
Victor, Jerry Siegel,
Chris Marshall's right-hand.

485
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:06,632
-You groom also?
-That's good.

486
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,677
I was showing Victor our new
building on 57th. Wanna join us?

487
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:12,721
No, I can't. I'm jammed.
I've got--

488
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,140
-I can see that.
-Well, I mean--

489
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,392
Don't forget to scoop.

490
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:23,023
Kill! Kill! Rufus! Kill!

491
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:26,193
Let's go. You're gonna
have to hold it. Come on!

492
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,238
Okay, I'll handle it.
Walk to the park.

493
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:33,200
I'll get Rufus and Jerry,
and we'll catch up. Go ahead.

494
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:36,370
Guys, there's nothing here.
Just an old friend and her son.

495
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:39,289
-She got a name?
-Yeah, "Unidentified Old Friend."

496
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,793
You give me this,
I'll give you 15 minutes...

497
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,795
...inside the benefit,
Monday night.

498
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,380
You'll get us in at the Met?

499
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:47,923
-You got it.
-Open bar?

500
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,884
-Don't push it.
-Thank you.

501
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,887
Come on, Rufus.

502
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,014
Did you have fun
with mean, old Jerry?

503
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,225
A great time!
It was perfect timing.

504
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:02,104
Both Delgado and Maddox
saw me walking your goddamn dog.

505
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:05,232
See, you should get out more.
Come on, Rufus.

506
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,901
He's gonna be there.
He's gonna be there at 1:30.

507
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:11,321
I want you there at 1:00, okay?
All right? Okay?

508
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,782
Bye. I'm going to shower.

509
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:17,828
I just borrowed them.
Pretty hot, though, huh?

510
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,122
-Wait up!
-Don't say anything. Just act--

511
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:25,293
I couldn't do it.
All those photographers all the time.

512
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:27,921
You don't know what you can do
until you have to.

513
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,924
There's not a lot of choice.
You get used to it.

514
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:33,218
-Can I take him?
-Sure. Go ahead.

515
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,095
-Be careful. He's strong.
-Come on.

516
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,848
-Be careful and stay close.
-I will.

517
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:40,892
Hang on!

518
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:48,025
Thanks for this.
He's been a little down lately.

519
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:51,737
Then yesterday, he gave a speech
at school, and he messed it up.

520
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:52,988
It was bad.

521
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:56,658
Speeches can be tricky.
What happened?

522
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:59,327
I don't know.
He just froze and ran off-stage.

523
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:02,998
Now he has this thing about speaking
in public. He's all freaked out.

524
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:06,126
I always get nervous
before I go on.

525
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:09,463
-Really?
-Yeah.

526
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:13,633
Well, not always.
Just sometimes.

527
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,927
-Mr. Marshall?
-Look at the dogs.

528
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:19,639
What a surprise, a dog walker.
Let me guess. Jerry sent you.

529
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,808
Yeah, to get Rufus.

530
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,393
-Is that Rufus?
-That's him.

531
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:24,978
He's beautiful.

532
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,813
-Can I?
-Sure.

533
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,440
-Hey, buddy!
-Can I have him?

534
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,650
-Okay.
-Thank you.

535
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:33,403
-Ma, can I go play?
-Yeah, go ahead.

536
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,572
This is for you.

537
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,992
-Thank you.
-Bye. Let's go.

538
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,413
It's from my nanny.

539
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:45,415
Do you want to sit down?

540
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,502
-Sure.
-Over here.

541
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:57,344
Cool, I won't get dirty.

542
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:01,765
Oh, Lord! I almost sat on your face.
Right there.

543
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:17,155
Ty seems like a terrific kid.

544
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:20,450
Thanks. I'm kind of crazy
about him.

545
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:25,205
I've never met a 10-year-old
Nixon aficionado.

546
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:29,543
Yeah, I know. Last year,
they studied the '70s at school...

547
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:32,587
...and he's become obsessed
with the politics, the music.

548
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,798
He was reading
the Kissinger biography.

549
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,716
-You're kidding!
-No.

550
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:41,138
I'm waiting for him to discover another
decade. Until then, I'm learning a lot.

551
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:44,391
Well, I think it's great.

552
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:47,519
-You do?
-I do.

553
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:52,357
Guess what? I threw a stick
in the air, and Rufus caught it!

554
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:55,902
-Really?
-Yeah. I'm gonna go do it again.

555
00:35:56,362 --> 00:36:00,282
So how long are you
in town for?

556
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,952
I'm not sure.

557
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,912
You always stay at the Beresford?

558
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:11,084
Sometimes I feel like I live there.

559
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,753
So, what brings you here?

560
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:17,841
-Work.
-What do you do?

561
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:23,805
-Oh, my God! 11:00, by the tree.
-What?

562
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,974
Check it, 11:00.

563
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,809
That's Eddie Yatter.

564
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:31,021
-What does he want?
-He's paparazzi. I can't shake him.

565
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,607
He works for Blanton Maddox...

566
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:36,693
...whose goal lately is
to catch me with another woman...

567
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:41,698
...so his sleazy tabloid can say
that I've broken up with--

568
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,367
Your supermodel fiancée?

569
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,119
Oh, God! Ty!

570
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,413
-What?
-Come on!

571
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,125
-I just realized that you--
-Excuse me?

572
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,794
-Sorry, it's just that my face is--
-What?

573
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:57,589
-What's wrong with your face?
-It's stuck to your--

574
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,299
What's that?

575
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:04,137
-Oh, God. Oh, God! Get it off.
-Here, let me. It's okay.

576
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:07,641
Oh, my God! Did I get
anything on it? Is it okay?

577
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,517
It's perfect.

578
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,855
-So....
-Okay.

579
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,316
Don't believe everything you read.

580
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:19,319
-Any of it true?
-No.

581
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:24,407
Well, we were seeing each other.
Now we're seeing less of each other.

582
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,701
It's complicated.

583
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:30,413
I want to show you something.
Follow me.

584
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:38,046
Oh, God.

585
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:42,759
-Let me help you.
-I got it. It's fine. I'm good.

586
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,929
Don't worry about me.

587
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,181
Look at that.

588
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,728
It's like two different worlds.

589
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:57,232
-Interesting perspective, huh?
-Yeah.

590
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,277
And I'd like to point out
it's paparazzi-free.

591
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:05,240
You know when I come here most
is when I have to make a speech...

592
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:06,741
...and I get nervous.

593
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:08,285
-You get nervous?
-Sure.

594
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,452
See that?

595
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,706
Sometimes when I have
to stand up in front of people...

596
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:16,751
...my heart kind of races,
and I can't remember my words.

597
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:20,380
-Same here. I know.
-Really? Same with you?

598
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,758
Wow. Well, in my business,
it's not a good thing.

599
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,803
-What do you do?
-What do I do?

600
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,222
I want to show you something.

601
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:33,977
I hold on to this.

602
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,938
A paper clip?
Was that a paper clip?

603
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:38,857
It was.
I had to find something...

604
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,526
...to draw the nervous energy
away from my heart.

605
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,403
Like a....

606
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,740
-Like a lightning rod?
-Like a lightning rod. Exactly.

607
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,950
All the energy
goes into the paper clip.

608
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:51,244
And then what's left is....

609
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:52,912
Your speech.

610
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,915
Yeah, a smooth,
and I'd like to think...

611
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:58,752
...very compelling speech.

612
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,589
Some of the best speakers
in history...

613
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,633
...a paper clip.

614
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:08,386
Let me see, Henry Kissinger.

615
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:11,056
He wasn't known
for his speaking abilities.

616
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,683
No, he wasn't, was he?

617
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:19,397
Well, imagine what he would've
been like without the:

618
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:23,276
-He would've really sucked.
-He would've what?

619
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,111
-Really sucked.
-Right.

620
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,032
So maybe you'll try again?

621
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,870
Hey, Ma,
can we go see the penguins?

622
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:39,209
-Let's go see penguins.
-Five minutes.

623
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,797
-You're a bad influence.
-I am?

624
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,465
Hurry up!

625
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,640
Look at this guy go.

626
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,852
They're so funny.

627
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:01,523
They look like little, fat,
short guys with tuxedos.

628
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:05,026
Speaking of fat guys in tuxedos,
there's this thing Monday night.

629
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:09,781
It's a black-tie.
It's a $2500-a-plate dinner.

630
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:14,077
-Oh, my God. $2500 per plate?
-$2500 a plate.

631
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:17,664
-I hope you get to keep the plate.
-You can if you want.

632
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:19,666
What is it for?

633
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:23,002
For the inner-city literacy campaign,
something I support.

634
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:26,172
It's a big benefit that Maddox
throws every year.

635
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:30,677
It's not quite as boring as it sounds.
I don't know, are you interested?

636
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:36,015
Wait a minute. Isn't that the guy who
hired Yatter to get pictures of you?

637
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,600
Yes, it is.

638
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,853
I don't get it.
Why would you go?

639
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:44,524
I go because-- I go--
It's exposure.

640
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:48,069
Won't everyone know you're there
just to expose yourself?

641
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:51,364
Well, I kind of
have to expose myself.

642
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:54,701
-When you put it that way--
-I didn't. You put it that way.

643
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:57,495
I don't care how much
you pay for dinner.

644
00:40:57,663 --> 00:41:00,874
You shouldn't serve yourself up,
no matter what the cause.

645
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:03,626
So why don't you tell me
what you really think.

646
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:06,379
You really want me
to tell you what I think?

647
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:11,217
If Mr. Wanton Maddox, or whatever
his name is, really wants to help...

648
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:14,888
...why doesn't he give the $2500
per plate to the inner-city schools?

649
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:17,974
And eat a little bit lighter that night,
you know?

650
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:22,020
So why don't you come with me
and tell him yourself.

651
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:24,689
Monday...

652
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:26,900
...I'm busy. Sorry.

653
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:31,613
You're busy, you can't?
What? Can you change it?

654
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,907
It's complicated.

655
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:38,495
Which reminds me, I gotta get
out of here. Come on, we gotta go.

656
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:42,123
-We gotta go. We're gonna be late.
-Do we have to?

657
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,419
-I gotta get back.
-Caroline.

658
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:50,798
This can't be it. Come on,
we haven't seen the snakes.

659
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:53,009
Except for Yatter.

660
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:58,056
It was nice meeting you,
Chris Marshall.

661
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,064
We're late. We gotta go.
Come on.

662
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,982
Here, Ty....

663
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:12,070
-Don't use them all on one speech.
-I won't.

664
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:16,699
-Keep up the good voting record.
-I'll do my best.

665
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:24,832
"It's complicated."
What kind of answer is that?

666
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,292
Honest.

667
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:30,129
The only thing complicated between
me and him would be my bra strap.

668
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:34,092
Look, what am I supposed to do?
Make his bed with me in it?

669
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,343
Get real!

670
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:38,471
-He thinks I'm a guest here.
-All right. All right.

671
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:41,140
But just tell me what he was like.

672
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:44,477
Sexy eyes.

673
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,646
And nice lips.

674
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:49,816
What about the hands?
Were they big?

675
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:58,825
-They were perfect.
-Perfect works.

676
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,743
-Marisa!
-Who? What?

677
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:04,330
-Marisa Ventura, are you back there?
-Oh, my God, it's Paula!

678
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,885
What are you doing?

679
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:20,805
I just....
I spilled something on my apron...

680
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:24,183
...so I was cleaning it,
and she was helping me tie it.

681
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:27,020
Mr. Bextrum wants to see you
in his office right now.

682
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,486
Oh, shit!

683
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:42,452
Look who's here.
Let's review the last hour, okay?

684
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,456
Delgado killed while you were
out walking that goddamn dog.

685
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,751
-You got a pen that works?
-Sure. Here you go.

686
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:52,879
-Anything else I can do for you?
-No, that's good, thanks.

687
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,548
Get this note to the woman
in the Park Suite.

688
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:58,301
Her name is Caroline.

689
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,470
-Can you handle that for me?
-Certainly.

690
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,556
-Thank you.
-Who's Caroline in the Park Suite?

691
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:06,225
Someone I met.
You wanted me to have an escort...

692
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:08,728
...for that Maddox literacy thing
on Monday night.

693
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:12,982
But I was thinking more of a blind,
ex-illiterate senior citizen who learned...

694
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:16,653
-...to read while fighting Nazis.
-I thought your mother was in Florida.

695
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:20,239
Just make sure she's not married,
on medication...

696
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:22,450
...or a Democrat.
Did you check, or--?

697
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:23,618
Rufus.

698
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:27,038
Sure, okay, great.
Can I talk to you for a second?

699
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:30,583
I want you to find out who
Caroline is in the Park Suite.

700
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,919
Don't write it down.
Just remember it.

701
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,504
Thanks. Good job.

702
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,766
Come in, Miss Ventura.

703
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:53,439
I assume you know the reason
you've been called here.

704
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:55,858
I think so. Yes, sir.

705
00:44:56,819 --> 00:45:01,114
Do you know what the foundation
of a great hotel is?

706
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,785
Location?

707
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,288
Loyalty and trust.

708
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:13,042
Would you say those are qualities
that you possess?

709
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,752
I would. Yes, sir.

710
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,757
Miss Burns agrees.

711
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:22,051
And she's urged me
to consider you.

712
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:25,054
We had no idea you were
interested in management...

713
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:28,224
...until Miss Kehoe brought us
your application.

714
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:32,645
By the way, you forgot
your social security number...

715
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,189
...and your mother's maiden name.

716
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:39,736
If you just fill them in
and sign right there. Perfect.

717
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:44,157
Normally, you'd go into the program
and train for a year as a butler, but--

718
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:47,744
-Given the circumstances--
-Due to overbooking, understaffing...

719
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:50,163
...we decided to accelerate
your application.

720
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:53,541
And move you into management
after the six-week training.

721
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:56,127
With the proviso that you
pass the practical exam...

722
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:59,088
...and fulfill each requirement
for every station.

723
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:02,008
So you see, Miss Ventura,
sometimes...

724
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:06,763
...when life shuts one door,
it opens a window.

725
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,348
So jump.

726
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:16,022
Steph, where are you?
I know you're in here.

727
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:20,276
-Don't tell me you're busted.
-No, you are.

728
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:23,029
You know what?
You had no right!

729
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,530
What are you talking about?

730
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,866
You filled out
an application for me?

731
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:30,870
-They're considering you.
-Do you know what you've done?

732
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:33,873
-I did you a favor.
-No. If you wanna do me a favor...

733
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,501
...then mind your own business
once in a while.

734
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:39,921
For two years, you've yapped
about getting out of uniform...

735
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:41,631
...and what ideas you got.

736
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:45,218
This morning, I'm having coffee
with Rosalie from personnel...

737
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:47,762
...and I ask her.
I go, "Marisa got a shot?"

738
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,848
She goes, "Marisa who?"
I go, "Marisa Ventura. She's applied."

739
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:54,185
She goes, "If she applied,
I'd slip it to the top of the pile."

740
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:57,814
So I just act real nonchalantlike
and I go, "Are you sure?"

741
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,650
So she goes, she double-checks,
and she tells me:

742
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:05,363
"Marisa Ventura ain't never applied
for no management program ever."

743
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:08,407
Imagine my shock and dismay.

744
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:10,451
My own partner,
lying to me like that.

745
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:14,330
Then I figured maybe you were
too chickenshit, so I did it myself.

746
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,082
If they took you,
you'd be happy.

747
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:19,669
And if they didn't, you wouldn't know
the difference. So sue me!

748
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:22,880
These are the golden years.
We gotta prove our mothers wrong.

749
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:25,049
Don't waste them.

750
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:42,191
What we did today was wrong.

751
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:45,278
But you didn't really lie.
Not technically.

752
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:47,405
Now you're starting
to sound like Nixon.

753
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:49,615
Letting someone believe
something's true when it's not...

754
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:51,576
...is just as much
a lie as a lie is.

755
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:55,454
I let him think I was staying in the
suite, not cleaning it. I'm the maid.

756
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:59,500
I hate to break it to you,
but I don't think he's after your money.

757
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:02,879
I can't believe you just said that!

758
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:07,466
Just get my keys in my pocket,
please. This is hot.

759
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:33,701
Good job.

760
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:38,080
All right, sweetie.
Behave yourself, okay?

761
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:41,000
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

762
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:46,213
Can I borrow this?

763
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:48,174
-Of course.
-Thank you.

764
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:49,884
Baby, bye.

765
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:52,011
And remember,
all security IDs...

766
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,847
...will need to be rephotographed
starting next week.

767
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:57,475
I think that's all.
Thank you very much.

768
00:48:57,643 --> 00:49:00,561
Barbara, Clarice,
come with me, please.

769
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:10,196
-Have you seen this?
-No. What?

770
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,198
Well, let me show you.

771
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,908
Give me this.

772
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:17,119
Yeah. So?

773
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:20,790
What do you mean, "so"? What if
somebody from the hotel sees it?

774
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,709
I hate to break the bubble.
You can't tell it's you.

775
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:27,046
-Don't worry about it.
-It's the front page of the paper today.

776
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:31,050
Stop. You do one spontaneous thing,
you think you're going to hell.

777
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:33,302
Do you understand
this could be bad?

778
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:36,597
Don't be such a Catholic. Please.
Come on.

779
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,188
Good morning.
Nice to see you.

780
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:46,440
-Can I steal him away for a second?
-Sure.

781
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:49,443
-Let me steal you away.
-Excuse me.

782
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,405
-I want to talk to you.
-What's the problem?

783
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:55,491
This! Do you know
what this is gonna cost me?

784
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:58,828
An entire day of doing nothing
but covering your ass.

785
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:02,081
I'm getting calls from The London
Times, The Washington Post...

786
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:05,418
...the Chicago Sun, asking
about her identity, her background...

787
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:08,421
...who the kid is. A kid!

788
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:13,592
Just when I get them to focus on your
assets, they're focusing on hers.

789
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,969
Thanks.

790
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:19,098
Yeah, well, they're fantastic assets,
don't you think?

791
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:31,277
Squeezing the circle
tighter and tighter and tighter...

792
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:34,655
...and release.
Let's try that again.

793
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:39,285
And squeeze the circle
tighter, tighter...

794
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:43,122
-...and relax.
-Sorry, I'll come back.

795
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:46,333
That's okay.
You can work around us.

796
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:49,712
We could use some more towels,
por favor. Rapido.

797
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,090
Squeezing the circle tighter...

798
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:56,135
...and tighter and tighter.

799
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:58,554
Radiating from the pelvis.

800
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:01,807
Good. Breathe.

801
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:03,768
Exhale.

802
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:05,561
Are you all right?

803
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:10,191
Twinkles, is it Eric?
I knew it.

804
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,862
He hasn't called once.

805
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,782
Not my cell, not the service,
not the hotel.

806
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:23,746
So last night I called him, and--
Rach, he was with....

807
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:27,083
I can't. It's like cheap wine.

808
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:30,503
-Shall we do some band work, ladies?
-Go on, I'm listening.

809
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:33,464
-I heard her in the background.
-The cheap wine?

810
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:37,093
His ex, in midlaugh.

811
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,677
Butler service, Miss Lane.

812
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:43,182
I have a message
from Mr. Christopher Marshall.

813
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,518
Christopher Marshall?

814
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:48,104
As in, Christopher Marshall?

815
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:52,358
He's staying in the York Suite
and was wondering...

816
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:54,860
...if you had a response
to the luncheon invitation...

817
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:57,530
...I placed in your room yesterday.

818
00:51:57,697 --> 00:52:00,407
-We're through. Thank you.
-In my room?

819
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:02,785
-I have to charge the full hour.
-Yesterday.

820
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,036
-Fine.
-For lunch?

821
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:05,704
-For two.
-Get out!

822
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:07,706
-Where?
-In his suite.

823
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,376
This is a miracle.

824
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:15,381
-Shall I give him an answer?
-Yes. Tell him yes. What time?

825
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:18,175
-1 p.m.
-She'll be there. Thank you.

826
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:19,885
When did this go down?

827
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:23,180
We met at this thing
in Southampton last summer.

828
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:26,100
I thought we had a moment.

829
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:28,352
"Can you steal away an hour,
please?"

830
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:32,731
-You think he saw you in the hall?
-Who cares? What should I wear?

831
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:34,900
You look good in anything.

832
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:37,194
But I didn't bring a thing!

833
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:38,571
Let's see.

834
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:45,703
Maria, thank goodness.
I need a favor. It's urgent.

835
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:49,206
Could you get those outfits
you returned for me yesterday?

836
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:52,209
There's this divine
Dolce cashmere coat. It's just--

837
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:56,881
Actually, they're still in the closet.
I thought you might want a second look.

838
00:52:57,424 --> 00:53:00,467
You are so good.
Thank God!

839
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:04,013
-You should be a personal assistant.
-She's a maid.

840
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:09,101
-So are they, with better titles.
-Actually, I'm up for a position.

841
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,061
What do you think?

842
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:13,606
Dolce coat, Gucci pants...

843
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:16,609
...or Ralph Lauren skirt,
Manolo pumps?

844
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:18,986
They're both divine!
Let's see.

845
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:21,947
How about the pants, open sandals,
see-through blouse...

846
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:24,742
...colored bra and carry
the Dolce coat for effect.

847
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:28,704
-Maria?
-She barely speaks English.

848
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,791
-What?
-Excuse me?

849
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:35,878
Maria, what do you think?

850
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:38,964
What about the beaded skirt
with that beige...

851
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:41,508
...crocheted halter
you have in the closet?

852
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:44,053
You know, casual sexy.
No stockings.

853
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,805
Definitely eighty-six the coat.
It sends the wrong message.

854
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:48,641
Like you're going someplace.

855
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:52,770
Besides, that whole see-through
blouse, colored-bra thing...

856
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:58,025
...reads a little desperate, older gal,
trying too hard. Don't you think?

857
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:02,196
You want to make him work for it.

858
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:05,324
Who does she think she is
to talk to me like that?

859
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,159
Thank you, Maria.

860
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:11,497
I have two words for you,
Rachel Hoffberg: Eric who?

861
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:15,751
Excuse me. Sorry.

862
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:19,922
Yes, that's it.

863
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:23,759
All handles parallel
with the right elbow.

864
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:31,558
Review your protocols
for table setting and wine service.

865
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:34,979
We're serving lunch
at the York Suite today.

866
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,576
Butler service, Mr. Marshall.

867
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:51,036
Come on in.

868
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:54,039
Rufus, it's okay.
Thank you.

869
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:35,039
Water glasses 3 inches east
of the wine goblets.

870
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:37,833
-Make a perfect triangle.
-Yes, sir.

871
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:50,637
Hold on, I'm coming.

872
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:58,437
You're an animal lover too!
So am I.

873
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:02,274
I just can't get enough of them.

874
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:07,321
What a wonderful idea.
Lunch à deux. Lovely!

875
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:12,451
I just knew that we made
a connection at the...

876
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:15,120
...Feathered Friends Tournament.

877
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,084
Look!

878
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:24,963
How sweet of you to remember.

879
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:30,010
But I hope you didn't think
I needed reminding.

880
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:35,307
Teddy Parrish sends you his best.

881
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:36,642
Oh, Teddy.

882
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:39,019
Right. Yeah.

883
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:40,729
How is Teddy?

884
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:43,565
Drinking again,
but you didn't hear it from me.

885
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:45,651
Excuse me,
I gotta check on something.

886
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,569
Of course.

887
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:54,368
Who is that over there?

888
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:56,954
Caroline Lane.

889
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:00,958
No. No, it's not her.

890
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:02,668
-It's not her?
-No.

891
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:06,213
The Maddox thing.

892
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:10,175
-Are you going?
-Of course.

893
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:13,971
You know who I can't figure out
where I know them from?

894
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:16,098
The woman visiting you
the other day...

895
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:20,185
...kind of Mediterranean,
with a little boy about 10.

896
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:24,022
Rachel Hoffberg, Mediterranean?
She's from Westport.

897
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:28,694
She's premenopausal,
but don't tell her I said so.

898
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:32,823
You're staying in the Park Suite,
right, Caroline?

899
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:35,993
Yes. Yes, I am.

900
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:38,495
Good.

901
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:41,874
Well, it's the damnedest thing.

902
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:55,596
This salmon is perfect.

903
00:57:55,889 --> 00:58:00,225
Your whole presentation today
has been excellent. Well done.

904
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:01,935
Thank you.

905
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:04,563
Make sure you tuck it in tightly.

906
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:08,567
She's about 5'6", dark hair,
really beautiful, has a kid named Ty.

907
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,569
What the hell happened?

908
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:13,947
-I'm sorry, sir.
-Don't be sorry. Just find her.

909
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:16,700
Chris, I loved your quote
in The Times.

910
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,702
Please!

911
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:34,092
We're all here to try to land
the Rothford Estate. It's worth zillions.

912
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:38,013
And Sotheby's are counting on me
to lock the whole thing up.

913
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:40,390
-Thank you so much.
-Really?

914
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:42,476
Rufus, come here.

915
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:43,977
Thank you.

916
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,395
Sit. Sit.

917
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:49,024
Maria, could I have a little water,
please?

918
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:52,277
-Good boy.
-Such a sweet dog.

919
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:53,445
Allow me.

920
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,949
-That will be all.
-You know Nettie Rothford.

921
00:58:57,116 --> 00:58:58,367
Sure.

922
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:00,452
She and I virtually grew up together.

923
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:04,164
Her place was bang
next to Daddy's on the Vineyard.

924
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:11,630
-Right there.
-Good evening.

925
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:14,132
Another interesting day now,
huh, Marisa?

926
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:17,803
-I don't know. Was it?
-You tell me.

927
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,596
Nice lunch?

928
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:22,933
All right, what's up, mystery man?

929
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:25,894
How many times you watched
the monitors with me?

930
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:29,815
How many times we enjoyed
the comings and goings?

931
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:30,983
Thousands.

932
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:35,028
You know what?
You over there, nosy body.

933
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:38,782
You know I'm beholden
to report employees misbehaving.

934
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:45,330
And there's only one thing
could make me shut my mouth.

935
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:53,839
You dirty old man.

936
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:59,344
You're in trouble.
What are you laughing at?

937
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:03,015
About the silver soap dishes....

938
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:05,017
Rach, darling, I'll just be a sec.

939
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:08,312
-Hi, I'm Caroline Lane--
-In the Park Suite, yes.

940
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:11,732
-I called about a ticket to the--
-Benefit. Monday night.

941
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:16,528
We were able to procure you a single
at a table adjacent to Mr. Marshall's.

942
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:19,239
Fantastic! And how much will that be?

943
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:21,575
-Three thousand dollars.
-What?

944
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:24,286
The rates are raised
when a couple is split.

945
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,496
Singles are always harder to place.

946
01:00:26,664 --> 01:00:30,834
Well, I mean what is it?
Is it on the Internet I'm an ex-couple?

947
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:33,545
I mean, does the whole hotel know?

948
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:37,883
Is there a Biblical sign on my forehead?
"Unmarried, unclean"?

949
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:42,095
Do I bear the scarlet letter? I'm....

950
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:43,263
I'm....

951
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:46,391
I'm just....
Sorry. I....

952
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,435
I'm better now.

953
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:51,021
Just charge it to my room.

954
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:52,481
Yes, ma'am.

955
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:55,567
Come on, Rach. Ghastly man!

956
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:58,236
I am terrified to ask
what that was about.

957
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:00,614
I think, being dumped.

958
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:03,909
-Can I get your autograph?
-Amber? Is that your name?

959
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:06,286
-Amber's your name.
-How you doing?

960
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:10,374
Get in the car! Get in the car!

961
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:15,128
-Did she see us?
-Yeah. No. You're fine. All's clear.

962
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:17,339
-It's fine.
-How did this happen?

963
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:19,675
I think she's very attractive.

964
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:22,928
I had her checked out.
She comes from a family with money...

965
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:25,597
...politically neutral and
has no naked pictures.

966
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:27,849
That woman wasn't
the woman I wanted.

967
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:31,061
I don't know what to say.
I talked to the hotel manager.

968
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:34,898
That's the only Caroline Lane
staying in the Park Suite.

969
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:37,401
Wait. There she is.

970
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:39,736
That's her. Cordell, pull over.

971
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:47,160
-Hey, wait! Ty! Caroline!
-Hey, Chris!

972
01:01:47,328 --> 01:01:49,871
-Hey. How's it going, Ty?
-Okay.

973
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,373
-How you doing?
-Good.

974
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:55,544
You want to hear something strange?
I invited you to lunch, and you came...

975
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:56,962
...only it wasn't you.

976
01:01:57,463 --> 01:01:59,506
So, what happened?

977
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:04,261
-I don't know what you mean.
-Are you still staying at the Beresford?

978
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:08,432
No, we actually moved uptown.
You know, uptown.

979
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:11,309
Hop in. We're going
to the Tremont Housing Projects.

980
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:14,521
-We can drop you at the Upper East?
-Yeah, Mom!

981
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:19,192
No. Remember, we're going to a party
just a few blocks away, so we'll walk.

982
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,987
-So how do I get a hold of you?
-Her cell's 9-1-7--

983
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:24,322
How about I call you?

984
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:27,659
If you want to get in touch with him,
call this number.

985
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:30,620
That's my card.
What's your last name, hon?

986
01:02:30,788 --> 01:02:33,290
-Ventura. What's yours?
-Spanish?

987
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:36,793
-Jerry Spanish?
-No, Siegel. We have to go.

988
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:39,504
-So do we.
-Use that number. Call anytime.

989
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:41,006
-All right.
-Don't be shy.

990
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:45,302
-You're late. You have to give a speech.
-In the Bronx?

991
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:47,512
-On what?
-Housing projects.

992
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:48,680
Really?

993
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:52,517
You're telling people
in the Bronx about the projects?

994
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:54,936
No, I'm just gonna
take the press up there...

995
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:57,397
...and shine light
on the living conditions.

996
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:01,276
-Interesting.
-Yeah, we think so. Shall we? Okay?

997
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:03,320
-Bye.
-What are you not saying?

998
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:05,697
-Nothing.
-Tell me.

999
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:11,745
Maybe you should spend
real time in the projects...

1000
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:15,707
...and then you wouldn't have to make
up speeches and memorize them.

1001
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:19,211
You know, it would be coming
from someplace real.

1002
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:21,880
And how would you know? I mean....

1003
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:24,591
Because I grew up there.

1004
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:27,761
I lived in a four-block radius
my whole life.

1005
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:29,888
Bye.

1006
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:35,101
Okay, let's go. Come on.

1007
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:38,980
-Chris!
-What?

1008
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:43,443
Shall we? Okay? Let's go.
Gotta go. Gotta go. Gotta go.

1009
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:46,822
Who the hell is she?

1010
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:52,911
I'll tell you who she isn't. She isn't like
anyone I've met. And she isn't a phony.

1011
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:57,582
I'll make you a deal. You want me
at the benefit? Then get her to go.

1012
01:03:57,750 --> 01:04:01,878
I swear to God, I'll shake any
part of Maddox's body you want.

1013
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:06,091
Deal?

1014
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:08,802
Deal. All right, sure. Okay.

1015
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:17,936
Okay, get in.

1016
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:25,861
So for right now, with the review
and everything going on...

1017
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:28,321
...we need to be extra careful,
all right?

1018
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:31,241
That means no coming up
in the elevator to see me.

1019
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:33,618
And no Chris Marshall.

1020
01:04:33,786 --> 01:04:37,038
-It's not like you're breaking some law.
-Hey, I mean it.

1021
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:38,582
If you see him....

1022
01:04:38,749 --> 01:04:43,545
-I'll make like a baby and head out first.
-Thank you. Go to bed, okay?

1023
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:46,590
-Good night, Ma.
-Bye, baby.

1024
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:53,388
Heads up!

1025
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:56,683
The Chinese delegation will be
checking into the Lexington Suite.

1026
01:04:56,851 --> 01:05:00,687
Please note the television channel
needs to be set to one of the Chinese....

1027
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:02,480
Oh, my God. Hide me.

1028
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:06,401
The Shapiros have requested
an early check-in.

1029
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:08,778
So we'll put them in the Dior Suite.

1030
01:05:08,946 --> 01:05:10,447
Yes, sir?

1031
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:12,490
-They're in the hall.
-What are they doing?

1032
01:05:12,658 --> 01:05:15,327
-He's got something in his hands.
-Does it look serious?

1033
01:05:15,494 --> 01:05:17,370
Calm down, it's just a letter.

1034
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:19,539
-Find that girl.
-Certainly.

1035
01:05:19,707 --> 01:05:20,707
-He's coming.
-Be cool.

1036
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:24,336
He's walking. Get out of here.
He's out of here.

1037
01:05:24,503 --> 01:05:26,463
Thank you very much. That will be all.

1038
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:44,773
Now....

1039
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:48,485
Are you truly interested
in management?

1040
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:51,029
Yes, very much, sir.

1041
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:56,826
Then I suggest that you go
to the Met tonight...

1042
01:05:56,994 --> 01:06:02,040
...and end all association
with Chris Marshall.

1043
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:04,834
At least until you're a manager.

1044
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:07,337
Then you can make your own rules.

1045
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:10,048
I'll make sure your shift is covered.

1046
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:27,732
-Mari.
-What happened?

1047
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:31,569
-You can still be a manager, right?
-Yeah, if I break it off with Chris.

1048
01:06:31,737 --> 01:06:34,948
Break what off? No offence,
sweetheart. What planet are you on?

1049
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:36,783
You don't get it. None of you.

1050
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:39,035
There was something
different about him.

1051
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:40,453
Yeah, it's called money.

1052
01:06:40,621 --> 01:06:42,622
-No, it's called--
-Don't say, "love."

1053
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:44,791
-Don't let her say it.
-She's going to.

1054
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:47,002
We connected, you know....

1055
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:50,463
-I felt it. Ty felt it too.
-Snap out of it, all right?

1056
01:06:50,631 --> 01:06:53,425
You are not in love with this man.
He is not in love with you.

1057
01:06:53,592 --> 01:06:55,885
You have no connections,
affiliations or loyalties.

1058
01:06:56,053 --> 01:06:59,055
You're from two different worlds.
Do you hear me?

1059
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:01,433
-I hear you.
-Me too.

1060
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,184
I don't know.

1061
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:06,396
Come on, Maris, you....

1062
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:08,523
You could be manager!

1063
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:11,484
Think of it, girl. One of us...

1064
01:07:11,652 --> 01:07:13,653
...out there!

1065
01:07:13,821 --> 01:07:15,280
In a blazer.

1066
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:17,532
Yeah.

1067
01:07:18,492 --> 01:07:20,702
I don't have anything
to wear to this thing.

1068
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:24,581
-Honey, look, it's not what you got.
-Baby, it's who you know.

1069
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:27,459
-And what they got.
-You got it?

1070
01:07:27,626 --> 01:07:30,920
When you're a manager, your first
order of business is to get us--

1071
01:07:31,088 --> 01:07:33,673
Raises!

1072
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,717
All right, Ty, focus.

1073
01:08:59,885 --> 01:09:01,344
Eyes forward.

1074
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:04,514
Once more.
This is the Harry Winston....

1075
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:07,392
Wreath necklace. Worth more
than I'll see in 10 lifetimes.

1076
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:11,271
Good. And if it leaves her neck
at any time, you'll....

1077
01:09:11,438 --> 01:09:14,774
Be put up for adoption
while my mom....

1078
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:18,444
-Rots in prison!
-Excellent.

1079
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:24,868
-You want to say hi to Harry?
-Harry.

1080
01:09:25,035 --> 01:09:27,120
What do you need?
Tell me what you need.

1081
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:28,621
Just your support, Harry.

1082
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:30,999
What about a cameo
on Saturday Night Live?

1083
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:33,209
-Let's wait on that.
-I'm calling Lorne.

1084
01:09:33,377 --> 01:09:35,545
-It's nice to see you.
-Good to see you.

1085
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,474
-There they are. See them?
-I see them.

1086
01:09:48,642 --> 01:09:52,228
We're going to line up Maddox's
support and get Grey's endorsement.

1087
01:09:52,396 --> 01:09:53,938
Just go and get it over with.

1088
01:09:54,106 --> 01:09:57,692
-Is she here?
-She'll be here. She'll be here.

1089
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:02,280
-Have fun, Ma.
-Thanks.

1090
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:06,826
Listen, be good. Go to bed when
Steph tells you. No negotiating. Okay?

1091
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:08,328
Oh, God.

1092
01:10:08,495 --> 01:10:10,747
I can't breathe.

1093
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:13,917
What am I doing here, Steph?
This is all a lie.

1094
01:10:14,084 --> 01:10:16,711
No, honey.
It's more like a dream, you know?

1095
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:19,130
For one night,
you're living it for all of us.

1096
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:22,175
Don't think about tomorrow.
Just think about tonight.

1097
01:10:22,343 --> 01:10:24,302
Tonight, the maid is a lie.

1098
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:28,765
And this, this is who you really are.

1099
01:10:53,165 --> 01:10:54,374
What do you think?

1100
01:10:54,541 --> 01:10:57,126
I think we have a lot
of issues to talk about.

1101
01:10:57,836 --> 01:10:59,045
-Let's get together.
-Good.

1102
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:02,715
Excuse me. I think now's
the perfect time if you'd like to....

1103
01:11:02,883 --> 01:11:05,343
Oh, my God, Jerry.
Look who's here.

1104
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:09,555
Lovely of you,
but I don't think I'll be in town.

1105
01:11:09,723 --> 01:11:11,641
I'm gonna bring him over here.

1106
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:14,185
No. She should be here by now.
She's not coming.

1107
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:17,522
-She'll be here. She'll be here.
-She'd better be, Jerry.

1108
01:11:55,269 --> 01:11:57,228
You're beautiful.

1109
01:11:58,439 --> 01:12:00,690
So are you.

1110
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:07,739
Thank you for being here.

1111
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:13,703
I only came to tell you that this...

1112
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:16,914
...you and me, can't go
anywhere beyond this evening.

1113
01:12:17,082 --> 01:12:18,708
It just can't.

1114
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:22,920
Well, then, you should've
worn a different dress.

1115
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:29,927
Want to dance?

1116
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:56,788
You have to listen.
I know you're used to getting your way.

1117
01:12:56,955 --> 01:12:59,332
Yeah, until I met you.

1118
01:13:01,168 --> 01:13:04,253
There's millions of women who are
dying for you to look their way.

1119
01:13:04,421 --> 01:13:07,965
Yeah? Then why are you
making me work so hard?

1120
01:13:08,133 --> 01:13:10,802
Chris? Hi.
Maddox is open.

1121
01:13:10,969 --> 01:13:13,096
So why don't you go over,
two minutes.

1122
01:13:13,263 --> 01:13:15,640
-Jerry. I'm here--
-I'll take over. I know.

1123
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:21,813
-Oh, Chris. Hi.
-Hello.

1124
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:27,485
-What a night. I mean, who isn't here?
-Right.

1125
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:32,073
Do I need to know something
that I don't know already?

1126
01:13:32,991 --> 01:13:36,744
Well, that sounds like something
between you and your God, Jerry.

1127
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:39,122
I like a good mystery, you know.

1128
01:13:39,289 --> 01:13:41,916
But not where his girlfriends
are concerned.

1129
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:43,584
I'm not his girlfriend.

1130
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:46,295
Well, whatever.
I just need him focused.

1131
01:13:46,463 --> 01:13:48,214
-Sorry about that.
-Not at all.

1132
01:13:48,382 --> 01:13:50,049
-May I cut in?
-You certainly may.

1133
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:54,303
Where were we?
Right about here, wasn't it?

1134
01:13:54,471 --> 01:13:58,724
You better do what you're supposed
to because Jerry thinks I distract you.

1135
01:13:58,892 --> 01:14:04,647
Wait, wait. Never, never start
a sentence with "Jerry thinks."

1136
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:08,192
No, but you should do the right thing.

1137
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:12,905
Why are you smiling?

1138
01:14:13,073 --> 01:14:17,869
Nothing, just until this minute,
I didn't know what that was.

1139
01:14:18,036 --> 01:14:19,912
-But I do now.
-You do what?

1140
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,373
-Don't go anywhere.
-Chris, I didn't mean--

1141
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:25,543
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.

1142
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:49,317
Excuse me.

1143
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:51,527
Excuse me.
Haven't we met?

1144
01:14:51,695 --> 01:14:55,198
-I'm Caroline Lane and you're...?
-Sotheby's Caroline Lane?

1145
01:14:55,365 --> 01:14:57,283
-Yes.
-It's wonderful to see you again.

1146
01:14:57,451 --> 01:15:01,662
I just knew we knew each other.
I never forget a face. Wow!

1147
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:04,332
Is that a Harry Winston wreath?

1148
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,251
They haven't made
that design since the late '60s.

1149
01:15:07,419 --> 01:15:10,087
You're very good.
Excuse me, I have to go.

1150
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:13,216
Listen, just between us girls.

1151
01:15:13,383 --> 01:15:16,302
Are you here with Chris?

1152
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:18,804
-Can you keep a secret?
-Of course.

1153
01:15:18,972 --> 01:15:21,849
Good. So can I.

1154
01:15:30,317 --> 01:15:41,452
Caroline.

1155
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:44,372
-Do you have somewhere else to be?
-I have to leave.

1156
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:46,165
You're not leaving. You're running.

1157
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:49,293
What I can't figure out is, are you
running towards something you want?

1158
01:15:49,461 --> 01:15:53,047
Or are you running away from
something you're afraid to want?

1159
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,883
Look, I've made
so many mistakes already.

1160
01:15:56,051 --> 01:16:00,429
-I just don't want to make it worse.
-You won't. I promise.

1161
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:03,766
There's something
you don't know, okay?

1162
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:06,269
Oh, God. How do I tell you this?

1163
01:16:07,104 --> 01:16:11,566
-The first time you saw me, I was--
-You were mesmerizing.

1164
01:16:24,496 --> 01:16:27,290
If tonight is all we have...

1165
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:31,127
...stay. Please.

1166
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:18,109
It's over, baby.

1167
01:18:29,996 --> 01:18:32,164
Hi, honey.

1168
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:34,625
I'm good.

1169
01:18:34,793 --> 01:18:37,002
At work.

1170
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:41,799
Listen, abuela's gonna be there in
about 10 minutes, and I'll be home at 6.

1171
01:18:41,967 --> 01:18:44,510
Did you and Steph have a good time?

1172
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:46,303
Yeah?

1173
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:02,403
What are you gonna do in Buffalo?

1174
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:05,781
Well, my plan is to sort of
accidentally bump into him.

1175
01:19:05,949 --> 01:19:09,160
-Do you think that's too obvious?
-No.

1176
01:19:13,623 --> 01:19:16,542
-A Harry Winston wreath?
-Morning.

1177
01:19:17,294 --> 01:19:20,045
Isn’t that that maid?

1178
01:19:21,923 --> 01:19:25,009
I mean, where would a maid get
that necklace? I thought maybe--

1179
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:28,888
I'll fast-forward through this, and you
just point her out if you see her.

1180
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:33,976
Oh, wait, could you just
go back on that bit?

1181
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:41,066
I mean, it could be her.

1182
01:19:41,234 --> 01:19:44,862
Let's just--
Can we just go forward?

1183
01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:51,535
Wait! That's my Dolce coat!

1184
01:19:51,703 --> 01:19:55,039
-How could you have missed that?
-I'm sorry, sir.

1185
01:19:57,959 --> 01:20:00,044
I'll have maintenance
get there with a plunger.

1186
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:03,672
And I'll call the pharmacy to see
if they have something for that.

1187
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:08,928
Excuse me, sir. Mr. Bextrum wants
to see both of you in the Park Suite.

1188
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:32,910
Lionel. Marisa.

1189
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:37,164
Oh. Well, that's interesting.
She told me her name was Maria.

1190
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:40,084
I thought it would be impolite
to correct you.

1191
01:20:40,252 --> 01:20:43,587
And I suppose you think
it's polite to steal people's clothes?

1192
01:20:45,715 --> 01:20:48,259
-I didn't steal--
-Miss Ventura, Mr. Bextrum has spent...

1193
01:20:48,426 --> 01:20:51,720
...30 minutes trying to persuade
Miss Lane not to press charges.

1194
01:20:51,888 --> 01:20:54,098
I suggest you say as little as possible.

1195
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:56,100
We have it all on video.

1196
01:20:56,268 --> 01:20:57,935
Was everything returned?

1197
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:01,730
-Yes, sir.
-Oh, Chris, I'm terribly sorry...

1198
01:21:01,898 --> 01:21:05,234
...to interrupt you. We thought you
should know what was going on.

1199
01:21:05,402 --> 01:21:08,070
-What is going on?
-The woman you thought was a guest...

1200
01:21:08,238 --> 01:21:10,531
...on this floor is the maid on this floor.

1201
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:11,949
Aren't you, Marisa?

1202
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:14,285
No. Wait, her name is Caroline.

1203
01:21:14,452 --> 01:21:18,622
No, Chris, darling, that's my name.
She steals clothes, identities--

1204
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:22,626
What the hell's happening here?
Why are you dressed that way?

1205
01:21:23,962 --> 01:21:25,796
Caroline?

1206
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:29,508
Is this true?

1207
01:21:36,433 --> 01:21:38,100
Yeah, it is.

1208
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:42,521
Jesus Christ! The press is gonna
have a field day with this one.

1209
01:21:42,689 --> 01:21:44,565
There's no reason to involve the press.

1210
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:46,859
How will you prevent her
from speaking?

1211
01:21:47,027 --> 01:21:48,986
This would never happen
at the Four Seasons.

1212
01:21:49,154 --> 01:21:52,197
I can assure you it has never
happened here before either.

1213
01:21:52,365 --> 01:21:56,452
Lionel, you are slipping. You should've
noticed something. I am disappointed.

1214
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:59,288
Please, Mr. Bextrum,
he had nothing to do with this.

1215
01:21:59,456 --> 01:22:01,957
Of course, sir. I understand.

1216
01:22:02,125 --> 01:22:05,502
We'll talk about this later.
Miss Ventura, you no longer work here.

1217
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:07,546
Go to security,
hand in your passes...

1218
01:22:07,714 --> 01:22:10,007
...and you'll be escorted
from the building.

1219
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:14,345
-Yes, sir.
-Is that really necessary?

1220
01:22:14,512 --> 01:22:17,056
Chris, let the man do his job, okay?

1221
01:22:17,223 --> 01:22:19,350
Oh, Chris.

1222
01:22:19,517 --> 01:22:24,188
Oh, Chris. I can't help but feel
that this is partly my fault.

1223
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:26,357
It isn't. Spare yourself.

1224
01:22:26,524 --> 01:22:28,192
At least let me buy you lunch.

1225
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:32,196
After all, we've only got each other
to get through this humiliation.

1226
01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:37,368
Caroline, the first lunch was a mistake.
A second would be complete torture.

1227
01:22:37,869 --> 01:22:39,912
Drinks, then?

1228
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:44,041
I need your nametag, passkey
and your ID card.

1229
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:47,962
-Sorry, Marisa, but I have to.
-I understand.

1230
01:22:49,089 --> 01:22:51,590
God, don't tell me
they fired you over this too.

1231
01:22:51,758 --> 01:22:53,342
No.

1232
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:57,346
Actually, I made a decision
a moment ago.

1233
01:22:57,514 --> 01:22:59,390
It was long overdue.

1234
01:23:01,059 --> 01:23:02,935
You quit?

1235
01:23:03,103 --> 01:23:05,062
Sometimes...

1236
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:10,234
...we're forced in directions that we
ought to have found for ourselves.

1237
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:12,778
Thank you.

1238
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:16,240
Thanks, Keef. Bye.

1239
01:23:16,866 --> 01:23:19,451
To serve people...

1240
01:23:19,619 --> 01:23:22,246
...takes dignity and intelligence.

1241
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:26,291
But remember,
they're only people with money.

1242
01:23:26,459 --> 01:23:31,255
And although we serve them,
we are not their servants.

1243
01:23:31,423 --> 01:23:36,969
What we do, Miss Ventura,
does not define who we are.

1244
01:23:37,137 --> 01:23:42,433
What defines us is how
well we rise after falling.

1245
01:23:45,979 --> 01:23:49,314
I think you'll make a wonderful
manager someday.

1246
01:23:51,776 --> 01:23:55,988
And it's been my great honor
to have worked with you.

1247
01:24:14,174 --> 01:24:15,966
Marisa?

1248
01:24:16,134 --> 01:24:19,219
Marisa! Caroline! Marisa!
I don't know which name to use.

1249
01:24:19,387 --> 01:24:21,305
Marisa.

1250
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:23,307
I don't get it. What just happened?

1251
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:25,142
What don't you get? I'm the maid.

1252
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:28,187
What was all this, some kind of bet?

1253
01:24:28,354 --> 01:24:30,314
A little game of what, get-the-guests?

1254
01:24:30,482 --> 01:24:32,941
I was trying on her clothes,
and you were there...

1255
01:24:33,109 --> 01:24:35,319
...and you invited
me out, and everything--

1256
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:38,155
And you thought you had to lie
to keep me interested?

1257
01:24:38,323 --> 01:24:39,573
Who's kidding who here?

1258
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:42,659
Think you would've looked at me
if you knew I was the maid?

1259
01:24:42,827 --> 01:24:43,827
-Well....
-Come on.

1260
01:24:43,995 --> 01:24:45,871
With respect for
your big-hearted politics...

1261
01:24:46,039 --> 01:24:49,500
-...I don't think so, Mr. Assemblyman.
-You didn't give me a chance.

1262
01:24:49,667 --> 01:24:53,837
You stand on your soapbox, judging
everyone, so sure they're judging you.

1263
01:24:54,005 --> 01:24:55,672
And you think they're not?

1264
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:58,801
Come on. Half the time, I'm
a stereotype they make fun of.

1265
01:24:58,968 --> 01:25:02,429
The other half of the time, I'm
invisible. Maybe that's the point.

1266
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:06,308
First time you saw me, I was cleaning
your bathroom, only you didn't see me.

1267
01:25:06,476 --> 01:25:09,186
Was I supposed to introduce
myself while taking a leak?

1268
01:25:09,354 --> 01:25:11,730
-You can't nail me for that.
-What are you doing?

1269
01:25:11,898 --> 01:25:13,023
Not now, Jerry. Just--

1270
01:25:13,191 --> 01:25:14,733
-Go.
-You might as well sell tickets.

1271
01:25:14,901 --> 01:25:16,193
-I don't care.
-You care.

1272
01:25:18,154 --> 01:25:21,031
-No. No. No. No.
-Marisa.

1273
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:22,741
I just want the truth.

1274
01:25:26,871 --> 01:25:29,373
All right, you want the truth?

1275
01:25:31,876 --> 01:25:35,295
There was a part of me
that wanted to see what it felt like...

1276
01:25:35,463 --> 01:25:39,383
...to have someone like you look
at me the way you did, just once.

1277
01:25:42,345 --> 01:25:44,054
And I'm sorry.

1278
01:25:44,222 --> 01:25:45,806
Truly.

1279
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:49,560
If I could rewind the past week,
I would.

1280
01:25:51,729 --> 01:25:53,522
Was any of it real?

1281
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:58,944
Yeah, it was real.

1282
01:26:00,071 --> 01:26:03,949
It was so real it made me wonder
how I was ever gonna give you up.

1283
01:26:06,911 --> 01:26:11,582
But I had to give you up.
That was the plan.

1284
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:16,712
And then....

1285
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,256
Last night...

1286
01:26:20,592 --> 01:26:22,718
...I couldn't.

1287
01:28:13,705 --> 01:28:18,208
Rosalie from personnel called.
We expected you hours ago.

1288
01:28:18,376 --> 01:28:19,626
Hi, baby.

1289
01:28:19,794 --> 01:28:21,795
She told me what happened.

1290
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:24,798
Hey, Ma. You okay?

1291
01:28:24,966 --> 01:28:27,050
Scoot over, let me see your homework.

1292
01:28:27,218 --> 01:28:28,719
I don't know what to say.

1293
01:28:28,886 --> 01:28:31,722
What are we gonna do for dinner?
You hungry, sweetie?

1294
01:28:31,889 --> 01:28:34,057
Will you look at me?

1295
01:28:34,225 --> 01:28:37,519
No. I'm gonna take a bath.

1296
01:28:43,526 --> 01:28:45,360
Don't, Mom.

1297
01:28:45,528 --> 01:28:49,031
What were you thinking,
going out with someone like that?

1298
01:28:49,198 --> 01:28:50,741
Someone like what?

1299
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:54,077
Chris Marshall.

1300
01:28:54,245 --> 01:28:57,080
You had to pretend to be somebody
so he'd go out with you?

1301
01:28:57,248 --> 01:29:00,250
Where is your pride, Marisa?

1302
01:29:00,418 --> 01:29:02,794
People like you make people
like him a God.

1303
01:29:02,962 --> 01:29:06,048
Why, because he's rich? White?
He has things we don't have...

1304
01:29:06,215 --> 01:29:08,091
...that we don't want to dream about?

1305
01:29:08,259 --> 01:29:11,970
It must really burn you that I think
I have the right to go out with him.

1306
01:29:12,138 --> 01:29:14,598
You don't.

1307
01:29:14,932 --> 01:29:18,143
Ty, go to your room
and finish your homework, please.

1308
01:29:20,813 --> 01:29:23,648
-What happened to you?
-Don't speak to me like that.

1309
01:29:23,816 --> 01:29:26,651
I am not the one
who lost her job today.

1310
01:29:26,819 --> 01:29:29,071
No, I did. I messed up.

1311
01:29:29,238 --> 01:29:33,367
Okay? It's all my fault. You know what?
It's all right. I'll be fine.

1312
01:29:33,534 --> 01:29:36,078
You will because
we'll call Señora Rodriguez.

1313
01:29:36,245 --> 01:29:40,624
-She owes me a favor. She has--
-I'm not calling Mrs. Rodriguez.

1314
01:29:40,792 --> 01:29:43,502
I love you, okay? I do.

1315
01:29:43,669 --> 01:29:46,546
But I don't want to clean houses.

1316
01:29:46,714 --> 01:29:48,840
There's nowhere to go from there.

1317
01:29:50,176 --> 01:29:55,472
Hasn't this taught you anything? Wake
up, little girl, you have responsibilities.

1318
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:59,101
And they come every month
like clockwork.

1319
01:29:59,268 --> 01:30:01,353
You want to end up
back in the projects?

1320
01:30:01,521 --> 01:30:05,315
Keep dreaming dreams
that will never happen.

1321
01:30:05,483 --> 01:30:08,985
You want to put food on the table?
Call Señora Rodriguez.

1322
01:30:13,366 --> 01:30:15,700
You're right, Ma.

1323
01:30:15,868 --> 01:30:18,412
I'm a good cleaning lady.

1324
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:21,832
I'll start over.

1325
01:30:21,999 --> 01:30:24,000
But not with Mrs. Rodriguez.

1326
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:29,256
I'm gonna find a job
as a maid in some hotel.

1327
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:33,802
After some time passes, I'm gonna
apply for the management program.

1328
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:36,847
And when I get the chance
to be a manager....

1329
01:30:37,014 --> 01:30:40,559
And I will, Ma. I know I will.

1330
01:30:40,726 --> 01:30:43,478
I'm going to take
that chance without any fear.

1331
01:30:43,646 --> 01:30:47,399
Without your voice
in my head telling me that I can't.

1332
01:30:53,156 --> 01:30:54,197
Did you see this?

1333
01:30:55,533 --> 01:30:57,742
-How did it start?
-Did he know you were a maid?

1334
01:30:57,910 --> 01:31:00,745
-Are you a Beresford perk?
-How long were you involved?

1335
01:31:00,913 --> 01:31:02,247
How did they find you out?

1336
01:31:02,415 --> 01:31:04,833
Any advice to other maids
looking to trade up?

1337
01:31:05,001 --> 01:31:07,711
-Did Democrats put you up to this?
-Does he tip well?

1338
01:31:07,879 --> 01:31:10,088
Is it true you're booked
on Larry King Live?

1339
01:31:10,256 --> 01:31:12,757
I'm at the Beresford Hotel,
where yesterday...

1340
01:31:12,925 --> 01:31:16,720
...Senate hopeful Chris Marshall was
captured on video in a lovers' spat...

1341
01:31:16,888 --> 01:31:19,848
...with a woman now identified
as a hotel maid.

1342
01:31:20,016 --> 01:31:21,558
Who's kidding who here?

1343
01:31:21,726 --> 01:31:24,728
Think you would've looked
at me if you knew I was the maid?

1344
01:31:24,896 --> 01:31:27,063
-With respect--
-Oh, shit.

1345
01:31:28,274 --> 01:31:29,483
Oh, my God.

1346
01:31:30,109 --> 01:31:32,235
We won't--
We will not be answering--

1347
01:31:32,403 --> 01:31:35,238
We will not be taking
any questions right now.

1348
01:31:35,406 --> 01:31:38,366
Mr. Marshall will make a statement.

1349
01:31:43,372 --> 01:31:45,081
Morning.

1350
01:31:45,249 --> 01:31:47,417
I'd like to make a short statement.

1351
01:31:47,585 --> 01:31:51,296
And it will be all
that I have to say about this....

1352
01:31:51,464 --> 01:31:54,758
This invasion of my privacy.

1353
01:31:56,969 --> 01:32:00,055
I happened to meet
Miss Ventura and her son...

1354
01:32:00,223 --> 01:32:06,144
...during my stay
at a hotel in New York.

1355
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:09,439
And we became friends.

1356
01:32:11,692 --> 01:32:16,071
There are people from all walks
of life who I count as friends.

1357
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:20,116
And my only regret in this instance
is that one of them, Miss Ventura...

1358
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:26,164
...was subjected to the scrutiny
and innuendo of the media...

1359
01:32:26,332 --> 01:32:30,043
...as a result of that friendship with me.

1360
01:32:39,470 --> 01:32:43,557
I need these numbers
to be plus 10 percent.

1361
01:33:05,037 --> 01:33:07,497
Welcome to the employee cafeteria.

1362
01:33:10,501 --> 01:33:13,336
It's open 24 hours a day....

1363
01:33:13,879 --> 01:33:15,672
Please.

1364
01:33:33,482 --> 01:33:35,567
Is today the 19th?

1365
01:33:35,735 --> 01:33:37,861
Six more shopping days.

1366
01:33:38,029 --> 01:33:39,696
He's here. He's back!

1367
01:33:39,864 --> 01:33:43,992
-Who? What are you reading?
-Yesterday's paper. Chris is in town.

1368
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:46,536
So? Go put your clothes on.
It's late.

1369
01:33:46,704 --> 01:33:49,122
So? He's giving a press conference.
Guess where?

1370
01:33:49,290 --> 01:33:52,917
I don't care. Okay? Come on.
Put your turtleneck on too. It's cold.

1371
01:33:53,085 --> 01:33:54,628
At your hotel.

1372
01:33:54,795 --> 01:33:55,962
-Ma!
-What?

1373
01:33:56,130 --> 01:33:57,213
At your hotel!

1374
01:33:57,381 --> 01:33:59,591
I heard you, bubba!

1375
01:33:59,759 --> 01:34:03,720
Don't you think it's weird?
You'll be there, he'll be there.

1376
01:34:04,513 --> 01:34:07,390
So will a thousand other people.
We talked about this.

1377
01:34:07,558 --> 01:34:10,018
You have your
turtleneck on backwards.

1378
01:34:10,186 --> 01:34:11,895
I thought we talked about this.

1379
01:34:12,396 --> 01:34:14,064
I know, but it's like fate.

1380
01:34:14,231 --> 01:34:18,902
No, it's like New York City
and an available conference room.

1381
01:34:19,070 --> 01:34:20,779
You knew, didn't you?

1382
01:34:20,946 --> 01:34:23,990
You weren't gonna tell me.
You knew he was coming.

1383
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:28,244
Remember, bubba, what I told you?
We talked about this.

1384
01:34:28,663 --> 01:34:32,707
He's not part of our lives,
but we wish him luck with his, right?

1385
01:34:33,668 --> 01:34:34,959
You think he misses us?

1386
01:34:39,882 --> 01:34:42,884
Well, he'd be crazy not to.

1387
01:35:06,283 --> 01:35:09,160
Mr. Marshall, if elected,
you'll be the third Marshall...

1388
01:35:09,328 --> 01:35:12,455
...to serve New York in the Senate.
How does it feel?

1389
01:35:12,623 --> 01:35:14,999
If I get elected, I'll let you know.

1390
01:35:16,836 --> 01:35:18,753
Did your father
leave you any advice?

1391
01:35:18,921 --> 01:35:22,298
Yeah, he said, "Don't run."

1392
01:35:23,509 --> 01:35:25,677
We have time
for one more question, folks.

1393
01:35:25,845 --> 01:35:28,304
Then we have
a meet-and-greet in the Green Room.

1394
01:35:28,472 --> 01:35:30,432
I have a question.

1395
01:35:31,642 --> 01:35:36,312
-What? Who said that?
-Mr. Marshall, down here.

1396
01:35:37,648 --> 01:35:39,149
Sure.

1397
01:35:39,316 --> 01:35:41,651
What's your question?

1398
01:35:43,195 --> 01:35:44,320
I was wondering....

1399
01:35:44,488 --> 01:35:47,782
-Chris, don't do this.
-No. Wait. I'm listening. Go ahead.

1400
01:35:47,950 --> 01:35:49,033
Well....

1401
01:35:50,077 --> 01:35:52,829
I know everyone makes mistakes.

1402
01:35:52,997 --> 01:35:57,500
And it's a sign of character to give
a person a second chance, right?

1403
01:35:57,668 --> 01:36:00,336
Right. I'm with you.

1404
01:36:01,714 --> 01:36:05,800
Even if someone lied,
they should be forgiven.

1405
01:36:05,968 --> 01:36:09,220
Otherwise, we'd never have
any congressmen or presidents.

1406
01:36:11,223 --> 01:36:13,516
Thanks very much.
We have to wrap this up.

1407
01:36:13,684 --> 01:36:16,186
Jerry, he's not done. Go on.

1408
01:36:16,353 --> 01:36:21,983
Well, what if you're not a politician
trying to do good for everybody?

1409
01:36:22,151 --> 01:36:25,528
What if you're just a regular person,
like a maid or something?

1410
01:36:27,698 --> 01:36:30,325
And she made a mistake.

1411
01:36:30,951 --> 01:36:33,369
Do you think she should
get a second chance?

1412
01:36:33,537 --> 01:36:35,371
I mean, nobody's perfect, right?

1413
01:36:36,332 --> 01:36:39,876
No. Nobody's perfect.

1414
01:36:40,669 --> 01:36:44,172
Ladies and gentlemen of the press,
take a look at a future candidate.

1415
01:36:45,090 --> 01:36:48,760
All right, thanks very much, folks.
We'll see you all in Buffalo.

1416
01:36:48,928 --> 01:36:54,182
-Don't do this. Don't throw it all--
-I'm just trusting my instincts here.

1417
01:36:58,729 --> 01:37:00,396
-Great speech.
-Really?

1418
01:37:00,731 --> 01:37:03,233
-Eating out of your hands.
-Thanks.

1419
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:09,781
Cool.

1420
01:37:10,741 --> 01:37:12,784
Where is she?

1421
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:16,788
This way!

1422
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:29,425
-Have you seen Marisa Ventura?
-No, I haven't seen Marisa.

1423
01:37:45,901 --> 01:37:48,027
We haven't had this
kind of story in a while.

1424
01:37:48,195 --> 01:37:49,320
It will kill his career.

1425
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:52,156
Will this hurt your
announcement for senator?

1426
01:37:52,324 --> 01:37:57,787
Mr. Marshall, are you still seeing her?
Was it love at first sight, Mr. Marshall?

1427
01:38:00,624 --> 01:38:02,333
-Marisa?
-Hey, Ma.

1428
01:38:02,501 --> 01:38:07,547
Ty? What are you both
doing down here? What's--?

1429
01:38:19,685 --> 01:38:21,477
Hello.

1430
01:38:22,521 --> 01:38:25,064
-Hi.
-Hi.

1431
01:38:25,232 --> 01:38:27,025
Look....

1432
01:38:28,277 --> 01:38:30,945
Can we start over?

1433
01:38:31,113 --> 01:38:33,573
Second chance, second date?

1434
01:38:33,741 --> 01:38:36,075
You as you, me as me.

1435
01:38:36,243 --> 01:38:38,453
No secrets.

1436
01:38:39,288 --> 01:38:41,039
What do you think?

1437
01:38:41,540 --> 01:38:45,793
-We know you're in there!
-Open up! Only one way out.

1438
01:38:56,221 --> 01:38:58,348
Marisa Ventura.

1439
01:38:59,892 --> 01:39:02,101
Housekeeping.

1440
01:39:02,895 --> 01:39:06,731
Chris Marshall. Candidate for Senate.

1441
01:39:07,191 --> 01:39:08,858
I'd appreciate your vote.

1442
01:39:10,861 --> 01:39:12,195
We'll see.

1443
01:39:15,157 --> 01:39:16,574
We're in!

1444
01:39:16,742 --> 01:39:18,952
Mr. Marshall, over here!

1445
01:39:19,119 --> 01:39:21,120
Mr. Marshall.

1446
01:39:35,886 --> 01:39:37,220
What's your relationship...

1447
01:39:37,388 --> 01:39:41,182
-...with the Latin community?
-Excellent. He speaks Latin-- Spanish.

1448
01:39:45,354 --> 01:39:47,355
Miss Ventura, will you
clean up the Senate?

1449
01:39:47,523 --> 01:39:51,818
What do you think, sir?
You two got a chance? Sir?
