1
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,785
Some things start out big,

2
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:06,662
and some things
start out small, very small.

3
00:01:06,768 --> 00:01:10,568
- But sometimes
the smallest thing...

4
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:14,300
can make the biggest changes of all.

5
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:23,049
- Yar, what is it?
- I don't know.

6
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:29,920
Plio, get back here!
We don't know what it is!

7
00:07:32,462 --> 00:07:43,073
Plio, be careful.

8
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:16,571
Dad, get over here.

9
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:23,711
- Zini, it's not safe.
- Oh, I always have to go
when stuff's happening.

10
00:08:30,961 --> 00:08:33,395
Well, what is it?

11
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:37,193
It was an egg. Look.

12
00:08:37,301 --> 00:08:41,203
- What?
- It's a cold-blooded monster
from across the sea.

13
00:08:41,306 --> 00:08:43,900
- Vicious, flesh-eating.
- Blech.

14
00:08:43,975 --> 00:08:47,103
- Eew.
- Looks like a baby to me.

15
00:08:47,212 --> 00:08:52,013
Babies grow up.
You keep that thing, one day,
we'll turn our backs...

16
00:08:52,118 --> 00:08:55,451
It'll be picking us
out of its teeth.

17
00:08:55,588 --> 00:08:59,080
- Things like that
eat things like us as snacks!

18
00:08:59,192 --> 00:09:02,628
So, what do we do?

19
00:09:02,729 --> 00:09:04,890
Get rid of it!

20
00:09:08,569 --> 00:09:11,697
What has gotten into you?

21
00:09:11,806 --> 00:09:15,401
Plio, that thing is dangerous!

22
00:09:15,544 --> 00:09:19,537
I'm sorry, little one.

23
00:09:19,648 --> 00:09:22,845
Okay, get rid of it.

24
00:09:22,951 --> 00:09:27,047
All right. I will.

25
00:09:39,603 --> 00:09:42,834
You'd better hurry up, Dad.
It looks hungry.

26
00:10:10,004 --> 00:10:12,199
Here.

27
00:10:12,307 --> 00:10:15,367
It's okay.

28
00:10:15,477 --> 00:10:19,106
- We'll teach him to hate meat.
- Hmph.

29
00:10:20,516 --> 00:10:23,952
Watch his head.

30
00:10:24,053 --> 00:10:27,454
I-I mean, watch it,
he could bite.

31
00:10:32,996 --> 00:10:35,658
This monster's
got no teeth.

32
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:38,758
What's he gonna do?
Gum us to death?

33
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:42,931
Zini, come on.
Look at that sweet little face.

34
00:10:43,007 --> 00:10:47,205
Does that look
like a monster to you?

35
00:11:24,387 --> 00:11:28,289
Let me out! Let me out!

36
00:11:31,762 --> 00:11:33,821
Hair ball.

37
00:11:33,931 --> 00:11:36,900
That was great! Get him!

38
00:11:36,967 --> 00:11:40,266
Oh, no! Attacking lemurs!
Suri, please!

39
00:11:40,371 --> 00:11:45,035
I can't take it! There
are too many of you! Come on!
Pick on someone your own size!

40
00:11:45,143 --> 00:11:49,045
Help!

41
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:54,745
Oh, no...

42
00:11:57,491 --> 00:12:01,393
Aladar,
you're not dead.

43
00:12:01,495 --> 00:12:04,464
No!

44
00:12:04,564 --> 00:12:07,727
All right, guys, break it up.
Remember the courtship?

45
00:12:07,835 --> 00:12:12,397
- You gonna miss
seeing all that smooching.
- Oh, Mom.

46
00:12:12,507 --> 00:12:18,309
- That's okay, Plio.
We can smooch right here.

47
00:12:18,413 --> 00:12:22,679
- It's a shame you don't like kids.
- Nasty little vermin.

48
00:12:22,818 --> 00:12:25,514
Ha-ha. Go find Zini.

49
00:12:25,622 --> 00:12:29,581
He's rehearsing pickup lines.
Let's hope he's found
some new material.

50
00:12:29,692 --> 00:12:34,186
Hey, sweetie, if you'll be my bride,
I'll groom ya.

51
00:12:34,298 --> 00:12:38,029
That is good.
Oh, that's good.

52
00:12:38,135 --> 00:12:41,798
Girls, I'm known
as the "professor of love,"

53
00:12:41,907 --> 00:12:44,569
and school's in session.

54
00:12:44,676 --> 00:12:48,942
- Yeah, I still got it.
- I hope it's not contagious.

55
00:12:49,014 --> 00:12:52,950
- I'm a raging epidemic of romance.
- Come on, hot stuff.

56
00:12:53,052 --> 00:12:56,215
Let's get goin'. You don't
wanna miss Yar's annual pep talk.

57
00:12:56,322 --> 00:12:59,655
Oh, goody. I can't
wait to hear the mating advice
of an old monkey.

58
00:12:59,793 --> 00:13:03,320
Hey-Hey-Hey, I heard
that in his day, that old monkey
was quite a swinger.

59
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,728
- You talkin' about Yar?
- Yeah, to hear him tell it,

60
00:13:05,866 --> 00:13:07,731
he put the "prime" in "primate."

61
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,802
Really?

62
00:13:09,837 --> 00:13:14,807
Okay, boys, gather 'round.
Listen and learn from the master.

63
00:13:14,842 --> 00:13:19,847
Now, girls, don't jump into
the trees after the first boy
with a cute back flip.

64
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:22,668
It's more fun
if you keep them guessing.

65
00:13:22,703 --> 00:13:25,419
And if a cute back flip
doesn't work, guess.

66
00:13:25,454 --> 00:13:29,857
You're never going to forget this
day, so make it one to remember.

67
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:34,297
But if you mess up, don't worry.
They'll never remember.

68
00:13:34,332 --> 00:13:38,134
Come on, guys!
We don't wanna let 'em down!

69
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:42,071
- Go on, now. Chest up! Chin up!
- Whoo!

70
00:13:44,676 --> 00:13:47,975
- Make 'em look good, son.
- Come on, Yar.

71
00:13:48,046 --> 00:13:51,538
- My charm and your brains?
No problem.

72
00:13:55,888 --> 00:13:58,413
Ha-ha!

73
00:13:58,524 --> 00:14:01,789
- Hey, girls,
look what just pulled into town.
- Hey, ladies!

74
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:04,955
Your buffet table of love.

75
00:14:05,032 --> 00:14:07,159
- Right here! Right here!
- Hey, beautiful!

76
00:14:07,267 --> 00:14:10,566
Hey, free samples!
Get me while I'm hot!

77
00:14:10,672 --> 00:14:13,937
Whoa!

78
00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:16,136
Zini.

79
00:14:18,947 --> 00:14:22,348
- Whoo! Wah-hoo!
- Whoo!

80
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:31,652
Yah-hoo!

81
00:14:45,743 --> 00:14:49,577
- You're missin'
all the action, pal. Come on.

82
00:14:49,682 --> 00:14:52,776
Hey, haven't you heard?
I am the action!

83
00:16:13,941 --> 00:16:17,342
Ah, don't worry, Zini.
You always have next year.

84
00:16:17,446 --> 00:16:20,438
Hey, I'm lucky to be rid of them.
With the ladies,

85
00:16:20,549 --> 00:16:23,541
- before you know it, they all
wanna move to a bigger tree.
- Hmm.

86
00:16:23,652 --> 00:16:29,056
Oh, well. Poor Zini.
The clan still has one bachelor.

87
00:16:30,326 --> 00:16:33,659
No, we have two.

88
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,233
Well, it's never
really been his best event.

89
00:16:43,341 --> 00:16:47,072
He's got a tougher hide than mine.
- Oh, Aladar,

90
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:50,637
if only there was someone
on the island for you.

91
00:16:50,749 --> 00:16:53,445
Well, you know, who looks like you,
but prettier.

92
00:16:53,553 --> 00:16:58,490
Come on, Plio.
What more could I want?

93
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,464
Whoa!

94
00:17:22,484 --> 00:17:25,612
- What are they?
- I don't know.

95
00:17:57,423 --> 00:17:59,516
Dad?

96
00:17:59,626 --> 00:18:02,527
Something's wrong.

97
00:18:04,498 --> 00:18:06,864
Aladar, where's Suri?

98
00:18:06,967 --> 00:18:10,528
She's up in the tree.

99
00:18:45,443 --> 00:18:48,276
Come on! Go! Go!
Come on!

100
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,314
- Mom!
- Suri!

101
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:53,749
- Mom! Mom!
- Suri!

102
00:18:53,852 --> 00:18:56,616
- Mom!
- Suri, where are you?

103
00:19:01,561 --> 00:19:03,552
Run, Aladar!
Run! Run!

104
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:17,042
Yar, come on!

105
00:19:17,145 --> 00:19:21,582
- Zini, jump! Jump!
- Zini, jump!

106
00:19:21,683 --> 00:19:24,948
Hold on!

107
00:20:23,385 --> 00:20:27,549
Plio! Yar! Where are you?

108
00:20:27,657 --> 00:20:31,354
Aladar, over here!

109
00:21:59,492 --> 00:22:02,757
I feel bad. I feel bad.

110
00:22:02,862 --> 00:22:06,263
Oh, Suri.
Easy, easy.

111
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,302
They're all gone.

112
00:22:10,437 --> 00:22:16,000
Shh, shh. I'm here.

113
00:22:16,077 --> 00:22:20,275
Come on.
We can't stay here.

114
00:23:22,384 --> 00:23:26,286
Now, now, Suri.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

115
00:23:26,389 --> 00:23:29,586
- Look!
- Whoa!

116
00:23:29,692 --> 00:23:32,126
- Did you see that?
- What?
- I did.

117
00:23:32,228 --> 00:23:36,756
- Me too!
- Where did it go?
- I don't know. Let's go see.

118
00:23:36,867 --> 00:23:40,098
- Leave it alone. Hey!
- Shh, Dad.

119
00:23:40,204 --> 00:23:42,638
- It's scaring Suri.
- No, it's not.

120
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,436
Everyone just be quiet.

121
00:24:52,918 --> 00:24:57,014
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Yar, grab on!

122
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:00,685
I can't reach!

123
00:25:08,802 --> 00:25:12,431
Aladar, they're stopping!

124
00:25:13,775 --> 00:25:13,797
Huh?

125
00:25:15,744 --> 00:25:19,510
Stay out of my way!

126
00:25:22,551 --> 00:25:24,849
You heard Kron.
Move it!

127
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:44,874
Watch it.

128
00:25:57,456 --> 00:26:00,516
Zini, get your head down.

129
00:26:29,459 --> 00:26:34,396
Walkin' backwards, huh?
Well, let me know if that
gets you there any faster.

130
00:26:34,498 --> 00:26:38,832
Keep those little legs movin',
Url, or you'll get left behind.

131
00:26:50,014 --> 00:26:52,380
Look at all the Aladars.

132
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:56,751
If you're even thinking
of joining them...

133
00:26:56,856 --> 00:26:59,552
Hang on! Hang on!

134
00:27:26,588 --> 00:27:29,056
Kron,

135
00:27:29,092 --> 00:27:31,559
There is a more protected spot
further down the...

136
00:27:31,594 --> 00:27:35,999
- We'll rest here for the night.
Go ahead, Bruton.

137
00:27:47,946 --> 00:27:53,145
Oh, Eema, I wish we were
at your nesting grounds now.

138
00:27:53,251 --> 00:27:56,311
All this pushing
and shoving about,

139
00:27:56,422 --> 00:27:58,549
just for a place to sleep.

140
00:27:58,658 --> 00:28:01,286
I'm not used
to this kind of behavior.

141
00:28:01,394 --> 00:28:05,922
- Baylene, you got big feet.
Just give 'em a kick. Git!

142
00:28:06,033 --> 00:28:08,900
Ooh, I couldn't possibly.

143
00:28:09,002 --> 00:28:11,197
Shoo, shoo.

144
00:28:11,305 --> 00:28:15,366
Will you come on, Baylene?
You wanna get
to the nesting grounds alive?

145
00:28:15,476 --> 00:28:17,569
- Show some backbone.
- Hey, there.

146
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,842
Oh, sorry about that.

147
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,748
Uh, it's just,
we overheard you talking,
and, um...

148
00:28:27,189 --> 00:28:30,488
Well, my word.
Look at Url.

149
00:28:30,594 --> 00:28:33,461
- He doesn't normally
warm up to strangers so fast.

150
00:28:37,534 --> 00:28:41,664
- What an unfortunate blemish.
- Good mud bath'd clear those up.

151
00:28:41,772 --> 00:28:44,969
Excuse me?

152
00:28:45,076 --> 00:28:48,568
Um, he's my grandfather...
Couple of times removed.

153
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,171
Try a couple of species removed.

154
00:28:51,283 --> 00:28:56,880
Uh, my name's Aladar.
This is my family.
We're all that's left.

155
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:59,618
Oh, my dear.
I'm so sorry.

156
00:28:59,726 --> 00:29:05,028
Baylene's the last of her kind.
Finding stragglers like her
all along the way.

157
00:29:05,098 --> 00:29:08,898
I heard you say something
about nesting grounds?

158
00:29:09,003 --> 00:29:13,064
It is the most beautiful place
there is, child.

159
00:29:13,173 --> 00:29:15,573
It's where the herd goes
to have their babies.

160
00:29:15,677 --> 00:29:19,545
Will we find anybody
that looks like us there?

161
00:29:19,648 --> 00:29:23,778
Oh, the last few days,
I've seen 'em all shapes and sizes.

162
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,217
Who knows
what we'll find.

163
00:29:26,322 --> 00:29:29,723
The hard job now
is just getting there.

164
00:29:29,825 --> 00:29:32,623
- And we're being driven
unmercifully.
- By who?

165
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:36,130
Kron, the herd's head honcho.

166
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:39,566
We can hardly keep up.
An older woman like myself...

167
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:42,036
It's... Well,
it's positively indecent.

168
00:29:42,106 --> 00:29:44,666
Then tell him.
What's the worst he can do?

169
00:29:44,776 --> 00:29:46,971
Oh!

170
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:51,480
Hey!

171
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:54,609
What's his problem?

172
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,622
- That's him, honey. Kron.
- Huh.

173
00:29:58,724 --> 00:30:01,659
- Uh, excuse me!
Kron, you got a second?

174
00:30:01,761 --> 00:30:06,027
- Get lost, kid.
- Hmm. Relax, Bruton.

175
00:30:10,137 --> 00:30:13,800
- Who are you?
- Uh, Aladar.

176
00:30:13,941 --> 00:30:16,876
Why aren't you uphill
with the...

177
00:30:17,012 --> 00:30:20,106
uh, young bloods?

178
00:30:20,215 --> 00:30:24,311
- Well, I was back here
talking to these guys.

179
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:27,217
- I guess they... They're having
a hard time keeping up.

180
00:30:27,323 --> 00:30:31,054
- So, you know, maybe you
could slow it down a bit?

181
00:30:31,127 --> 00:30:36,190
Hmm. Let the weak set the pace.
Now, there's an idea.

182
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:40,498
Better let me do the thinking
from now on, Aladar.

183
00:30:40,604 --> 00:30:43,732
- Hey, they need help back here.
- Hmm.

184
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:47,209
Watch yourself, boy.

185
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:51,248
Don't worry. That's how my brother
treats newcomers,

186
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,318
no matter how charming
they are.

187
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:57,355
You sure know how to catch
a girl's eye, there, stud.

188
00:30:57,456 --> 00:31:01,859
I wouldn't be catchin' nobody's eye
if I was you, especially Neera's.

189
00:31:01,995 --> 00:31:05,761
You just keep your head down,
and you mind what Kron tells you.

190
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:09,700
Since when do we take orders
from the likes of him?

191
00:31:09,803 --> 00:31:13,534
Kron has swatted flies
bigger than you, pops.

192
00:31:13,641 --> 00:31:16,804
I could hold that monster's brain
in the palm of my...

193
00:31:16,911 --> 00:31:20,278
No, Yar, she's right.
Better to keep our heads down
with this bunch...

194
00:31:20,382 --> 00:31:23,510
- than get 'em
bitten off by those things.

195
00:31:23,619 --> 00:31:28,283
Well, you consider yourself lucky
that's all that's following us.

196
00:31:53,885 --> 00:31:56,718
Hey, wake up.

197
00:31:56,823 --> 00:32:00,589
- Enough with the beauty sleep.
You're ravishing already.

198
00:32:00,693 --> 00:32:03,628
Hey! Hello!
Anybody in there?

199
00:32:03,729 --> 00:32:07,529
Zini, what are you doing?

200
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:10,467
I believe you left a wake-up call
for the dawn of time.

201
00:32:10,571 --> 00:32:12,971
- Come on! Move it!
- What's the hurry?

202
00:32:13,106 --> 00:32:16,598
Something's up.
The herd's gathering without us.
Let's check it out.

203
00:32:16,711 --> 00:32:20,579
Rise and shine!
Kron says everybody goes.

204
00:32:20,682 --> 00:32:23,446
Come on. Get up. On your feet.

205
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:26,180
Huh. The charm
never stops around here.

206
00:32:26,288 --> 00:32:28,586
You say something?

207
00:32:28,691 --> 00:32:31,319
Uh, no... no, sir.

208
00:32:32,696 --> 00:32:34,823
Unless you got a death wish,

209
00:32:34,931 --> 00:32:40,335
you and that little parasite
better get moving!

210
00:32:40,438 --> 00:32:43,168
Sheesh, is that guy ugly or what?

211
00:32:44,375 --> 00:32:47,833
Hey, hey, hey,
there's your girlfriend.

212
00:32:49,948 --> 00:32:55,284
- What are you talkin' about?
- You know what
I'm talkin' about: Neera.

213
00:32:55,387 --> 00:32:59,881
Scaly skin. Yellow eyes. Big ankles.

214
00:32:59,993 --> 00:33:03,019
Yeah, I made a real impression
on her.

215
00:33:03,129 --> 00:33:06,621
What you need is a little help
from the love monkey.

216
00:33:06,733 --> 00:33:10,726
- "The love monkey"?
- Ow, baby!

217
00:33:10,838 --> 00:33:16,037
Ow!

218
00:33:16,144 --> 00:33:19,136
That, children,

219
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:24,446
- is what's known as
a "jerkasaurus."

220
00:33:24,552 --> 00:33:28,352
And with that, the ice is broken.

221
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,871
We've got a lot of first-timers
here. Make sure they get it.

222
00:33:40,906 --> 00:33:43,999
We stop for nothing
and no one.

223
00:33:45,877 --> 00:33:50,213
If this is
your first crossing, listen up.

224
00:33:50,248 --> 00:33:53,983
- There is no water
till we reach the other side.

225
00:33:54,019 --> 00:33:58,388
And you'd better keep up,
'cause if a predator catches you,
you're on your own. Move out!

226
00:34:06,733 --> 00:34:10,430
Oh, my goodness.

227
00:34:10,538 --> 00:34:14,065
- It looks like a very long walk.
- And hot.

228
00:34:14,141 --> 00:34:17,110
If you smell somethin' sizzlin',
it could be me.

229
00:34:47,479 --> 00:34:50,915
We're moving too slow.

230
00:34:51,016 --> 00:34:54,508
I'll pick up the pace.

231
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,529
Hey, old girl,
you're wandering off a bit.

232
00:35:04,631 --> 00:35:09,534
That's all
I need: A monkey on my back.

233
00:35:47,711 --> 00:35:50,874
On your feet, Eema.

234
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,712
We can't let those things
eat you.

235
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:56,515
They're out there
waiting.

236
00:36:45,076 --> 00:36:47,567
- The lake!
- We made it?

237
00:36:47,678 --> 00:36:50,112
It's just over that...
that hill, baby.

238
00:36:50,214 --> 00:36:52,239
Oh, thank goodness.

239
00:36:52,384 --> 00:36:55,114
Come on, Eema.
Water. Remember water?

240
00:36:55,187 --> 00:36:58,816
Oh, it's time
to refresh my memory.

241
00:37:27,223 --> 00:37:29,748
I'm just gonna walk
right into that lake...

242
00:37:29,859 --> 00:37:33,818
- Until the water's
up to my eyeballs...

243
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:38,299
and soak it all in.

244
00:37:48,379 --> 00:37:52,179
Maybe the rains
collected somewhere else.

245
00:37:53,819 --> 00:37:56,754
What do you want us to do?

246
00:37:56,855 --> 00:38:00,154
Take a scout
and check the entire perimeter.

247
00:38:05,031 --> 00:38:09,195
Enough! You have to be strong now.

248
00:38:09,302 --> 00:38:13,363
The nesting grounds are only
a few days away. Keep moving!

249
00:38:13,507 --> 00:38:18,672
- Kron, we've never gone
this long without water.

250
00:38:18,779 --> 00:38:21,612
If we keep going like this,
we'll lose half the herd.

251
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:26,245
Then we save the half
that deserves to live.

252
00:38:33,196 --> 00:38:37,132
What? They're moving already?
Oh-Ho, we'll never keep up.

253
00:38:38,769 --> 00:38:40,600
There was water here,
always water here before.

254
00:38:44,808 --> 00:38:48,403
We always had water, always.

255
00:38:48,546 --> 00:38:53,108
- And... And plenty of mud.
- Oh, Eema, please.

256
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:56,950
The herd won't wait.
We must carry on.

257
00:38:59,725 --> 00:39:02,250
You gotta get up.

258
00:39:04,898 --> 00:39:09,062
- There was water everywhere.
- There is no water, dear.

259
00:39:25,854 --> 00:39:29,381
- Baylene, don't move.
- What is it?

260
00:39:29,491 --> 00:39:31,618
What's wrong?

261
00:39:31,728 --> 00:39:36,791
- Do you hear that?
- I sure do.
Lift your foot, Baylene.

262
00:39:39,369 --> 00:39:42,395
Ooh!

263
00:39:42,506 --> 00:39:45,134
Now press down.

264
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:52,838
I always did like big girls!

265
00:39:52,951 --> 00:39:56,182
- Water!
- Oh, my goodness!

266
00:40:01,225 --> 00:40:04,820
- Water! Come on!
- He found water.

267
00:40:07,565 --> 00:40:11,092
That's it, Eema.
Come drink.

268
00:40:28,188 --> 00:40:30,656
Kron, look.
All we had to do is dig, and...

269
00:40:30,757 --> 00:40:34,090
Good. Now, get out of the way.

270
00:40:46,342 --> 00:40:49,277
Wait! Wait!
There's enough for everyone!

271
00:40:49,378 --> 00:40:51,972
Ah!

272
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:02,792
- Oh.
- Eema!

273
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:11,363
That's it. Keep pushing and shoving.
That's very helpful.

274
00:41:21,314 --> 00:41:25,718
Bruton, we've been walking
in circles. There's no water here.

275
00:41:25,753 --> 00:41:28,846
- I think we should get back.
- Shh. Keep it down.

276
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:45,073
Let's get out of here.

277
00:42:12,103 --> 00:42:15,206
Now, you come out on three.

278
00:42:15,242 --> 00:42:18,973
One, two, three!

279
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,584
Come on. Come on out.
No one's gonna hurt you.

280
00:42:24,619 --> 00:42:27,051
Hey, hey.
What's going on?

281
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:30,223
The little Aladars haven't
had anything to drink.

282
00:42:30,258 --> 00:42:32,190
I think they're scared of me.

283
00:42:32,226 --> 00:42:34,626
Who wouldn't be?
You are pretty scary.

284
00:42:34,762 --> 00:42:37,890
Come on over, guys.

285
00:42:40,135 --> 00:42:43,798
- Take it easy. Don't worry.
She's just a hair ball.
- And proud of it.

286
00:42:43,905 --> 00:42:46,430
Come on. He's gonna
find you some water.

287
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:03,783
Here. Now, you just
take a foot and press.

288
00:43:05,896 --> 00:43:08,421
Whoa.

289
00:43:08,533 --> 00:43:11,093
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on. Come on. Knock it off.

290
00:43:11,202 --> 00:43:14,433
Let's work together here, huh?
A little teamwork. Ready?

291
00:43:14,539 --> 00:43:18,669
One, two, three. Press!

292
00:43:22,081 --> 00:43:25,346
Good job, Suri.

293
00:43:25,452 --> 00:43:30,287
- Where are your parents, anyway?
- A lot of us are on our own now.

294
00:43:32,659 --> 00:43:34,559
You like kids, I see.

295
00:43:34,662 --> 00:43:38,098
- Well, the skinny ones
can be a little chewy.

296
00:43:39,233 --> 00:43:42,566
I'm Aladar...
the "jerkasaurus."

297
00:43:42,671 --> 00:43:45,834
Ohh. Sorry about that.

298
00:43:45,941 --> 00:43:47,909
You're probably right.

299
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:51,207
- Dad, wake up.
- Huh?

300
00:43:51,314 --> 00:43:53,976
Why did you
help that old one?

301
00:43:54,083 --> 00:43:56,381
What else could we do?
Leave her behind?

302
00:43:59,355 --> 00:44:02,290
Oh. You mean, you actually...

303
00:44:02,393 --> 00:44:04,293
Well, that happens all the time.

304
00:44:04,395 --> 00:44:07,057
- You don't survive
if you're not...
- Strong enough.

305
00:44:07,131 --> 00:44:09,361
Well... yeah.

306
00:44:09,467 --> 00:44:12,095
Is that you talking,
or your brother?

307
00:44:13,171 --> 00:44:16,106
Everything's so different.

308
00:44:16,174 --> 00:44:19,610
I-I don't know
what to think anymore.

309
00:44:19,712 --> 00:44:22,977
Look, Neera...
we watch out for each other,

310
00:44:23,082 --> 00:44:25,983
we all stand a chance of getting
to your nesting grounds.

311
00:44:26,085 --> 00:44:29,179
- You sound so sure.
- I'm not,

312
00:44:29,289 --> 00:44:31,689
but it's all I know.

313
00:44:33,393 --> 00:44:36,021
So, um... Oh, water.

314
00:44:36,097 --> 00:44:38,588
I'll, uh,
get you some water.

315
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:41,601
- Can I try it?
- Sure. Just press.

316
00:44:45,841 --> 00:44:48,674
- Hmm.
- Oops.

317
00:44:48,777 --> 00:44:51,541
- Sorry.
- No. You... You first.

318
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:55,105
One down... and,

319
00:44:55,185 --> 00:44:57,915
well, one down.

320
00:45:20,212 --> 00:45:22,373
Kron!

321
00:45:22,482 --> 00:45:25,883
- Carnotaurs!
- What? They never come
this far north.

322
00:45:25,985 --> 00:45:29,284
The fireball must've
driven them out.

323
00:45:33,027 --> 00:45:37,430
You led them right to us!
Maybe you can feed them
with your hide!

324
00:45:37,531 --> 00:45:40,125
Move the herd out,
double-time!

325
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:54,115
- What's happening?
- My brother's moving the herd.

326
00:45:56,052 --> 00:45:59,385
Kron, what's going on?

327
00:45:59,489 --> 00:46:02,390
Carnotaurs. If we don't keep moving,
they'll catch up to us.

328
00:46:02,492 --> 00:46:05,723
But the others in the back...
They'll never make it.

329
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:07,593
They'll
slow down the predators.

330
00:46:07,699 --> 00:46:11,601
You can't sacrifice them
like this!

331
00:46:11,703 --> 00:46:15,230
- Hold it! That could be
you back there! Or you!

332
00:46:18,677 --> 00:46:21,339
If you ever interfere again,

333
00:46:21,447 --> 00:46:23,813
I'll kill you.

334
00:46:27,454 --> 00:46:30,981
Stay away from him!

335
00:46:31,091 --> 00:46:33,286
Ooh.

336
00:46:33,394 --> 00:46:37,330
Aladar, no.
You just... just go. I'll be okay.

337
00:46:44,272 --> 00:46:46,433
Let's go! Let's go!
Carnotaurs!

338
00:46:46,541 --> 00:46:48,406
- Carno-what?
- Carnotaur.

339
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:51,445
A mouthful of teeth
with a bad attitude. Let's go.

340
00:46:51,547 --> 00:46:55,313
Come on, you guys! Get on! Get on!
We're gonna get left behind.

341
00:46:58,254 --> 00:47:00,848
Let's go! Hurry up!
We're losing them!

342
00:47:00,991 --> 00:47:03,755
Aladar, slow down.

343
00:47:52,949 --> 00:47:56,084
Oh, joy. Blisters.

344
00:47:56,119 --> 00:47:58,820
I've got blisters
on my blisters.

345
00:47:58,855 --> 00:48:02,625
You don't wanna know
where I got blisters.

346
00:48:02,661 --> 00:48:05,728
- What was that?
- It came from up ahead.

347
00:48:05,763 --> 00:48:08,831
- Okay,
what's the worst thing it could be?
- A carnotaur.

348
00:48:08,866 --> 00:48:13,270
- What's the second-worst thing
it could be?
- Two carnotaurs! Oh!

349
00:48:13,306 --> 00:48:15,739
- That's it. I'm gone.
- Oh, my goodness!

350
00:48:15,774 --> 00:48:18,609
Everybody, we don't know for sure.
It could be the herd.

351
00:48:18,644 --> 00:48:21,445
- Let's check it out.
- Oh, my goodness.
Goodness gracious.

352
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:34,389
Oh, it's Bruton.

353
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:37,725
It appears we weren't
the only ones left behind.

354
00:48:50,179 --> 00:48:54,741
- What happened?
- Carnotaurs. We should keep moving.

355
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:59,048
- We can't just leave him here.
- We can if we move fast enough.

356
00:48:59,155 --> 00:49:03,649
Hey, you don't look so good.
Let me help you.

357
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:09,130
Save your pity.
I just need some rest.
Now, get away from me.

358
00:49:09,233 --> 00:49:12,168
Suit yourself.

359
00:49:14,706 --> 00:49:17,174
Hmm?

360
00:49:33,227 --> 00:49:36,526
If you change your mind,
we'll be in those caves.

361
00:49:38,632 --> 00:49:40,930
Mm.

362
00:49:46,007 --> 00:49:48,498
It's dark, but
at least it's dry.

363
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:52,341
I like dry. It's the dark part
I'm having trouble with.

364
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:55,178
Ouch!
Ooh. Sorry, Url.

365
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:57,548
Sturdy little thing,
ain't he?

366
00:49:57,653 --> 00:50:01,987
Ahem. We appear to have a visitor.

367
00:50:28,455 --> 00:50:31,356
You coming in or what?

368
00:50:31,458 --> 00:50:34,291
What is it with you?

369
00:50:34,395 --> 00:50:37,262
At least I know enough
to get in out of the rain.

370
00:50:37,365 --> 00:50:40,425
Now, come on.
On your feet.

371
00:51:02,493 --> 00:51:06,395
- Uh, you can lie down
with us. It's warmer.

372
00:51:14,506 --> 00:51:17,134
May I remind you
that he's one of them?

373
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:20,609
Well, looks like
he's one of us now.

374
00:51:29,356 --> 00:51:32,587
Ahh. Who booked
this trip, anyway?

375
00:51:32,692 --> 00:51:35,092
Ah, you'll be at the nesting grounds
soon enough.

376
00:51:35,162 --> 00:51:38,996
Well, when I get there, I'm gonna
give Kron a piece of my mind.

377
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:42,160
You tell him, Eema.

378
00:51:49,111 --> 00:51:52,842
If I could sleep that deep,
I'd be in paradise.

379
00:51:52,948 --> 00:51:57,214
If you could sleep
that deep, honey, you'd be dead.

380
00:52:01,057 --> 00:52:04,026
This plant grew
on our island.

381
00:52:05,463 --> 00:52:07,954
It will make you feel better.

382
00:52:10,067 --> 00:52:12,160
Ahh.

383
00:52:17,142 --> 00:52:23,081
Why is he doing this?
Pushing them on with false hope?

384
00:52:23,149 --> 00:52:26,175
It's hope that's
gotten us this far.

385
00:52:26,285 --> 00:52:29,118
But why doesn't he let them
accept their fate?

386
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:32,588
I've accepted mine.

387
00:52:32,693 --> 00:52:37,062
- And what is your fate?
- To die here.

388
00:52:37,164 --> 00:52:39,724
It's the way things are.

389
00:52:39,834 --> 00:52:42,200
Only if you give up,
Bruton.

390
00:52:42,303 --> 00:52:45,898
It's your choice,
not your fate.

391
00:52:50,012 --> 00:52:52,446
Well, the plant will help.

392
00:53:36,197 --> 00:53:39,333
Shh.

393
00:53:39,368 --> 00:53:41,198
Carnotaurs.

394
00:53:46,508 --> 00:53:49,170
- What do we do?
- Wake the others.

395
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,794
Oh.

396
00:54:13,371 --> 00:54:15,339
Ooh.

397
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,265
Go! Go!

398
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:44,497
Hurry!

399
00:54:46,942 --> 00:54:48,910
Move it, Eema!

400
00:54:50,112 --> 00:54:52,376
Oh!

401
00:54:52,514 --> 00:54:55,210
Aladar!

402
00:54:55,318 --> 00:54:57,912
Aladar! Oh, no!

403
00:55:04,461 --> 00:55:08,192
- I'll hold them off!
You help the others!

404
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:44,361
Bruton!

405
00:55:55,818 --> 00:55:58,116
Bruton! No!

406
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:13,894
Bruton!

407
00:56:31,892 --> 00:56:33,951
You did what you could.

408
00:57:36,697 --> 00:57:40,360
It's okay, little ones.

409
00:57:40,468 --> 00:57:43,062
We're going to make it.

410
00:58:07,598 --> 00:58:10,123
Okay, okay. Let's
do it again. Let's do it again.

411
00:58:10,201 --> 00:58:13,398
- Uh, I spy with my little eye...
- A rock.

412
00:58:13,505 --> 00:58:16,668
You got it again!
Ooh! You are good!

413
00:58:16,808 --> 00:58:20,938
Well, I'll tell you what I spy.
A dead end.

414
00:58:27,186 --> 00:58:31,555
- What do we do now?
- I guess we just go back.

415
00:58:31,658 --> 00:58:34,354
Hold on a moment.

416
00:58:34,461 --> 00:58:37,157
Zini, what is it?

417
00:58:37,231 --> 00:58:41,258
- Do you smell that?
- Yeah.

418
00:58:53,248 --> 00:58:56,911
Get a load of that.
- Good show.

419
00:58:57,020 --> 00:59:00,183
Everybody stand back.
We're outta here!

420
00:59:09,266 --> 00:59:12,201
Aladar, look out!

421
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:21,576
No!

422
00:59:56,619 --> 00:59:59,144
Aladar, we'll go back.

423
00:59:59,756 --> 01:00:02,247
Back to what?
It's gone.

424
01:00:03,493 --> 01:00:07,228
We're not meant
to survive.

425
01:00:07,264 --> 01:00:11,018
Oh, yes, we were.
We're here, aren't we?

426
01:00:11,053 --> 01:00:14,772
And how dare you
waste that good fortune
by simply giving up?

427
01:00:14,807 --> 01:00:18,509
Shame on you.
Shame on you! Shame on you!

428
01:00:18,545 --> 01:00:21,011
The worst of it is,

429
01:00:21,046 --> 01:00:24,182
you allowed an old fool like me
to believe I was needed...

430
01:00:24,217 --> 01:00:28,200
that I still had a purpose...
and do you know what?

431
01:00:28,236 --> 01:00:32,184
You were right.
And I'm going to go on believing it.

432
01:00:32,258 --> 01:00:36,092
And I, for one,
am not willing to die here.

433
01:01:26,118 --> 01:01:28,416
Oh, dear.

434
01:01:44,538 --> 01:01:47,006
The nesting grounds.

435
01:01:47,109 --> 01:01:49,737
It's... It's untouched.

436
01:02:11,535 --> 01:02:13,696
Our new home.

437
01:02:13,805 --> 01:02:16,831
And it comes with a pool!

438
01:02:24,517 --> 01:02:27,213
Cannonball!
Whoo-hoo-ha-ha!

439
01:02:28,754 --> 01:02:31,154
Ha. Amateur.

440
01:02:31,224 --> 01:02:34,523
Look out below!

441
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:57,881
Not to mention Neera.

442
01:02:57,987 --> 01:03:00,387
They'll get here...

443
01:03:00,490 --> 01:03:03,084
Mm. Soon enough.

444
01:03:05,529 --> 01:03:07,759
Oh, no.

445
01:03:07,865 --> 01:03:09,833
Eema?

446
01:03:12,136 --> 01:03:15,765
- I spoke too soon.
- What is it?

447
01:03:15,874 --> 01:03:19,332
That is the way
we used to get in here.

448
01:03:25,017 --> 01:03:27,349
They'll never make it
over that.

449
01:03:27,453 --> 01:03:32,117
Aladar, wait! Wait!
Kron'll eat you alive.

450
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:35,422
Let him try.

451
01:03:35,529 --> 01:03:39,829
Mm. I hope Kron's
in a listening mood.

452
01:03:56,652 --> 01:03:59,246
Stay here.

453
01:04:04,895 --> 01:04:07,557
We'll find a way
around it.

454
01:04:07,664 --> 01:04:11,430
In the morning,
we'll climb it.

455
01:05:13,338 --> 01:05:18,401
Our survival, our future,
is over these rocks.

456
01:05:18,509 --> 01:05:21,000
Now, let's go home!

457
01:05:31,024 --> 01:05:33,515
You'll make it,
won't you, boys?

458
01:05:33,626 --> 01:05:36,561
- No.
- Watch them. They're tough!

459
01:05:36,663 --> 01:05:40,155
If they can do it,
so can you!

460
01:05:48,243 --> 01:05:50,905
Kron!

461
01:05:51,013 --> 01:05:54,676
Get the herd out of here!
A carnotaur is coming!

462
01:05:57,487 --> 01:06:00,388
- Keep moving!
- Stop!

463
01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:05,257
- I've been to the valley!
There's a safer way!

464
01:06:05,362 --> 01:06:09,423
- Go on! Show 'em!
- Kron, listen to him.

465
01:06:09,533 --> 01:06:13,629
- Look, we gotta go now!
- Go where, straight
to the carnotaurs?

466
01:06:13,738 --> 01:06:17,367
If we hurry, we can get around them!
You can't get over those rocks!

467
01:06:17,475 --> 01:06:20,410
There's a sheer drop
on the other side!

468
01:06:20,512 --> 01:06:26,144
You're gonna kill the herd!
I know a way to the valley,
and everybody can make it!

469
01:06:26,252 --> 01:06:28,812
Now, follow me!

470
01:06:30,423 --> 01:06:32,550
Kron!

471
01:06:33,593 --> 01:06:35,754
They're staying with me!

472
01:06:35,862 --> 01:06:38,126
All right. Let's go!

473
01:07:33,559 --> 01:07:36,528
Neera!

474
01:08:32,225 --> 01:08:37,162
He's led that monster
right to us! This way!

475
01:08:37,264 --> 01:08:40,495
No! Don't move!

476
01:08:40,601 --> 01:08:44,662
If we scatter, he'll pick us off!
Stand together!

477
01:10:08,399 --> 01:10:10,264
Kron!

478
01:10:30,956 --> 01:10:33,686
No. No.

479
01:11:49,377 --> 01:11:52,278
Kron.

480
01:12:49,511 --> 01:12:51,411
Welcome home.

481
01:13:26,285 --> 01:13:30,346
Move over. Bringing in
babies is what I do best.

482
01:13:30,456 --> 01:13:33,357
I'd say it's been a few years
since you've hatched an egg.

483
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:37,863
- You're right, so let me
practice on your head.

484
01:13:37,964 --> 01:13:42,367
Look! Somebody wants to meet you.

485
01:13:45,706 --> 01:13:52,612
Ohh! Aren't you the sweetest
little small fry I ever did see?

486
01:13:52,714 --> 01:13:55,649
Hey, little guy.
He looks just like me.

487
01:13:55,784 --> 01:13:59,845
Meet your dad.
He's not as crazy as he looks.

488
01:13:59,956 --> 01:14:02,925
Ohh. Oh, happy day.

489
01:14:03,026 --> 01:14:06,291
Well done, little one.

490
01:14:06,396 --> 01:14:10,457
Come here, you little rascal.
Let me get a good look at you.

491
01:14:13,003 --> 01:14:17,167
Yep. You're your father's son,
all right.

492
01:14:17,275 --> 01:14:22,008
- Hey!
Look what I found! New neighbors!

493
01:14:22,113 --> 01:14:26,174
Any of you ladies up for a game
of "monkey in the middle"?

494
01:14:26,285 --> 01:14:29,652
Easy, now! Easy! Hey!

495
01:15:18,909 --> 01:15:24,006
None of us really know what changes,
big or small, lie ahead.

496
01:15:24,116 --> 01:15:28,018
One thing is certain...
Our journey's not over.

497
01:15:28,121 --> 01:15:32,490
We can only hope
that in some small way...

498
01:15:32,592 --> 01:15:35,720
our time here
will be remembered.
