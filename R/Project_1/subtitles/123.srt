00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,604
That same anomaly, a lightning storm
in space that we saw today,

669
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:34,648
also occurred on the day of my birth,

670
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:37,609
before a Romulan ship
attacked the U.S.S. Kelvin.

671
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,736
You know that, sir,
l read your dissertation.

672
00:45:39,821 --> 00:45:42,447
That ship, which had formidable
and advanced weaponry,

673
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:44,241
was never seen or heard from again.

674
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:46,284
The Kelvin attack took place
on the edge of Klingon space,

675
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:49,162
and at 2300 hours last night,
there was an attack.

676
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:52,707
Forty-seven Klingon warbirds
destroyed by Romulans, sir,

677
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:56,128
and it was reported that the Romulans
were in one ship, one massive ship.

678
00:45:56,212 --> 00:45:59,005
And you know
of this Klingon attack how?

679
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:04,719
Sir, l intercepted and translated
the message myself.

680
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:07,472
-Kirk's report is accurate.
-We're warping into a trap, sir.

681

The Romulans are waiting for us,
l promise you that.

682
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:13,562
The cadet's logic is sound.

683
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:16,148
And Lieutenant Uhura is unmatched
in xenolinguistics.

684
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:18,108

to accept her conclusion.

culminating in the events of today,

1015
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:41,028

an entire new chain of incidents

1016

by either party.

transporting something like a grapefruit

beam a grapefruit from one planet

in the same system,

1188
