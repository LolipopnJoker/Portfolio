1
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,054
<i>It was good...</i>

2
00:00:30,104 --> 00:00:31,891
<i>... that you called us.</i>

3
00:00:33,942 --> 00:00:36,912
<i>I don't know what happened.</i>

4
00:00:38,363 --> 00:00:39,882
<i>We were at the bar...</i>

5
00:00:41,532 --> 00:00:46,038
<i>... drinking, having fun...</i>

6
00:00:46,988 --> 00:00:52,195
<i>I don't even know how I got here.</i>

7
00:00:54,295 --> 00:00:56,965
Come on, she's been under too long.

8
00:00:57,215 --> 00:00:59,812
<i>You're the only one who can help me.</i>

9
00:01:05,073 --> 00:01:08,017
<i>Come on, come on...</i>

10
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:14,083
<i>- Tell me what I need to know.
- They'll kill me.</i>

11
00:01:17,193 --> 00:01:19,105
<i>You asked for my help.</i>

12
00:01:21,155 --> 00:01:22,383
<i>Come on.</i>

13
00:01:24,033 --> 00:01:26,244
Come on!

14
00:01:26,494 --> 00:01:28,413
<i>The contact in Minsk...</i>

15
00:01:28,663 --> 00:01:30,933
Give us the name.

16
00:01:32,584 --> 00:01:36,847
Dimitri... Miediev.

17
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:55,940
<i>- What now?
- Now we drink.</i>

18
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,736
<i>To friends.</i>

19
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:19,942
Get rid of that scum.

20
00:02:59,337 --> 00:03:03,174
- Did we get it?
- We got it.

21
00:03:58,813 --> 00:04:00,685
Would you like
to watch a movie, Mr Rosen?

22
00:04:00,886 --> 00:04:01,786
No, thank you.

23
00:04:07,488 --> 00:04:12,077
- Care to watch a movie, Mr Phelps?
- No, I prefer the theatre.

24
00:04:12,827 --> 00:04:17,165
Would you consider
the cinema of the Ukraine?

25
00:04:17,415 --> 00:04:19,462
Perhaps you'd choose one for me.

26
00:04:23,838 --> 00:04:25,034
Thank you.

27
00:04:49,739 --> 00:04:54,744
<i>Good morning, Mr Phelps.
This is Alexander Golitsyn,</i>

28
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:59,874
<i>an attaché at our embassy
in Prague. He is also a traitor.</i>

29
00:05:00,124 --> 00:05:03,419
<i>He has stolen one half
of a CIA NOC list</i>

30
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,923
<i>of all our deep cover agents
in Eastern Europe.</i>

31
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:11,594
<i>For security reasons,
the NOC list is divided in two.</i>

32
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:15,181
<i>The portion Golitsyn has
contains code names.</i>

33
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:20,812
<i>It is useless without its mate, which
matches the codes with true names.</i>

34
00:05:21,062 --> 00:05:26,860
<i>It is this half Golitsyn plans to steal
at an embassy reception tomorrow night.</i>

35
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:32,740
<i>Your mission, should you choose to
accept it, is to obtain proof of the theft,</i>

36
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:37,579
<i>shadow Golitsyn to his buyer
and apprehend them both.</i>

37
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:41,666
<i>I've despatched a team
selected from your group.</i>

38
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:46,921
<i>Sarah Davies is undercover now. Jack
Harmon can hack into their system.</i>

39
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:52,135
<i>Hannah Williams will do surveillance.
Your wife, Claire, will cover transport.</i>

40
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:56,389
<i>And Ethan Hunt
will be your point man, as usual.</i>

41
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,935
<i>He is now in Kiev and will
rendezvous with you in Prague.</i>

42
00:06:01,185 --> 00:06:05,648
<i>Should any member of your IM force
be caught or killed,</i>

43
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:09,861
<i>the Secretary will disavow
all knowledge of your actions.</i>

44
00:06:10,111 --> 00:06:14,401
<i>This tape will self-destruct
in five seconds. Good luck, Jim.</i>

45
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,541
A very straightforward objective.

46
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:44,654
We photograph Golitsyn stealing
the NOC list, follow him to his buyer,

47
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:49,992
apprehend both of them.
Now, here's the plot. Ethan...

48
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:55,456
You go into the embassy in character,
during a party. Hide in plain sight.

49
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:59,001
- You game?
- Wouldn't have it any other way.

50
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:04,507
Sarah, you're there as the embassy's
Washington visitor liaison.

51
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,635
You and Ethan will run the game.

52
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:15,059
- I haven't a thing to wear.
- Well, I'm sure you'll work it out.

53
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:20,916
Mark Golitsyn and hand him off
to Hannah. Hannah, you stay on him.

54
00:07:21,217 --> 00:07:22,217
No problem.

55
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:27,822
Jack, fingerprint security is accessed
through the elevator shaft here.

56
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:31,812
- So I guess I'm not wearing my tux.
- Open, close, get out.

57
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:37,815
Claire, you're in the vehicle.

58
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:42,296
Hannah will join you as Golitsyn
goes exterior. You two stay on him.

59
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:47,884
If I call "abort",
everybody walk away immediately.

60
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:52,138
Regroup here at 4 a.m.

61
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:53,525
Any questions?

62
00:07:55,975 --> 00:08:01,355
Can we get a cappuccino machine?
I don't know what you call this.

63
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:05,027
- I call it cruel and unusual.
- I made that coffee.

64
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:10,089
Is it possible that it's worse
than the sludge you made in Kiev?

65
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,887
- Hey, take it easy on my wife's coffee.
- We missed you in Kiev, Jim.

66
00:08:14,888 --> 00:08:16,088
Missed you too Ethan.

67
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,642
- Off on a cushy recruiting assignment?
- Did they put you up at the Plaza?

68
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,245
Drake Hotel, Chicago.

69
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:27,950
- Punishing! 24-hour room service.
- Chauffeured cars.

70
00:08:27,951 --> 00:08:29,551
Fat expense account.

71
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,053
He's getting soft in his old age.

72
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:37,058
Okay, listen. If that list
gets out into the open,

73
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:42,230
the names of our agents will be
up for grabs to the highest bidders.

74
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:49,079
Terrorists, arms dealers, drug lords.
Everyone who wants to get rid of us.

75
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:55,368
If they're exposed, they'll be executed.

76
00:08:56,327 --> 00:09:01,499
I'll run the whole show from here.
Let's punch out the details.

77
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:08,399
There's a camera built into the bridge.
It transmits what you see back here.

78
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:15,265
Can you hear me?
No, you need an earpiece.

79
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,811
You have lovely eyes...

80
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,313
- Can you hear me?
- Loud and clear.

81
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:28,694
If he has a car waiting, and he rolls,
stay with him no matter what.

82
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:36,184
- You should check out these streets.
- What do you think I've been doing?

83
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:40,280
- We're using Waltzer?
- He's our guy.

84
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:45,460
- Isn't he chairing a hearing?
- Not this week.

85
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:52,058
This week he's fly-fishing in County
Kildare with one of our Irish guides.

86
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:57,972
And he won't be back any time soon.

87
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:04,478
<i>Senator, it sounds as if
you want to lead the kind of charge</i>

88
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:11,511
<i>that Senator Church led in the 70s, and
destroy the US's intelligence capability.</i>

89
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:17,116
<i>I want to know who they are and how
they're spending taxpayers' money.</i>

90
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:21,954
<i>This is still a democracy.</i>

91
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:27,793
Stick of gum, right?
No. Red light, green light.

92
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:31,607
You have a lock you can't pick,
you mash them together...

93
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:37,372
"Hasta lasagne", don't get any on ya.
You'll have about five seconds.

94
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,236
Just don't chew it.

95
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,618
Ethan, Jack's inside. Let's go.

96
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:33,852
<i>How do you do, Senator?
How was the opera?</i>

97
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:39,425
- It was boring.
- Let me see if I can steer you through.

98
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:57,633
- Windows open by 2300.
- Mr Brandl, the mayor, and Mrs Brandl.

99
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:02,605
Senator,
I bet you don't remember me, do you?

100
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:07,712
- Of course. How are you, Ms Norman?
- He's in pocket, on the stairway.

101
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,152
Mr Golitsyn, nice to see you.

102
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,207
Hannah.

103
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,354
<i>Pull the shade.</i>

104
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,891
<i>Sarah, mark the package
and go to two.</i>

105
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:47,427
Your advance team said you'd like
a tour of the facility. This way.

106
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,239
Oh, great.

107
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:07,396
...which leads to the Denied Area,
the only limited access area here.

108
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,699
Governor's in position now.

109
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:49,187
- Can I help you?
- As you can see, there's surveillance.

110
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:53,616
I'm sorry,
I know it's in here somewhere.

111
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,170
Sergeant, why are you not in uniform?

112
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:02,158
<i>We've been ordered
to wear civilian clothes, sir.</i>

113
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,637
Be right back.

114
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:13,853
<i>- Do you have a Jack on your staff?
- I believe we did.</i>

115
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:20,085
An unreliable fellow, as I recall.
Constantly late and behind in his work.

116
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:28,059
<i>We were forced to tie him to a horse
and drag him around my barn.</i>

117
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,838
I'm working on it.

118
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:48,123
Sorry.
Thank you. Have a nice evening.

119
00:15:00,391 --> 00:15:03,704
That date with Sarah is definitely off.

120
00:15:33,049 --> 00:15:34,078
Higher.

121
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,359
He's heading to the Denied Area.

122
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,532
Get moving, Ethan. He's rolling to you.

123
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,519
Jack...

124
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,756
Jack, we're in position here.

125
00:16:05,206 --> 00:16:06,652
I didn't touch it.

126
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:12,559
- What about my coat? I'll freeze.
- Jack, open the doors.

127
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,585
He's in the box, Ethan.

128
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,966
- We'll take his exit. Open these doors.
- I don't have it.

129
00:16:31,816 --> 00:16:34,504
I'm opening the doors. Go under.

130
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,548
- He's got it.
- All right.

131
00:17:20,598 --> 00:17:25,586
- I saved your ass again, Jack.
- Such a nice ass.

132
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:29,884
- And a lonely ass.
- Transport in five minutes.

133
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:17,096
Jack, open the doors
and let the package roll.

134
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:21,225
Opening doors now.

135
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:26,898
Stairway, you're wrapped.
Go to transport.

136
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:36,251
- Jack, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

137
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:47,336
I don't have control, Jack.
Cut the power.

138
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:52,268
- Cut the power.
- Come on, Jack.

139
00:19:04,193 --> 00:19:05,038
Jack...

140
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,594
Jack... Jack?

141
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:17,156
<i>- Jack, do you copy?
- Man down, Ethan.</i>

142
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:21,619
<i>Man down.</i>

143
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:43,342
Ethan, stay where you are.
I'm coming to you.

144
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,778
The package is out in the open.

145
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:08,818
- Jim, he's in the open.
- En route.

146
00:20:29,012 --> 00:20:30,348
Jim, he's in the open.

147
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,604
Jim, the package is in the open.

148
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:43,668
I've got a shadow.
I can't lose him. Abort!

149
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:46,123
Ethan, he's out of pocket.

150
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:54,795
- I can't do that.
- We're being ambushed. Abort!

151
00:20:55,046 --> 00:21:00,369
<i>- Negative. Golitsyn is on the move.
- No, dammit, I said abort!</i>

152
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:14,465
- Watch the package. Jim, I'm coming.
- Jim gave an abort.

153
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:20,340
We are going to recover that disk.
You understand me? Now go!

154
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:56,482
- Where are you?
- 200 yards from the bridge.

155
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,318
<i>They're covering the frequency.</i>

156
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:03,391
<i>Cut all radio communication.</i>

157
00:22:27,897 --> 00:22:28,826
<i>Ethan...</i>

158
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:06,054
Sarah, abort. Repeat: Abort!

159
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:12,293
Abort! Do you read me?

160
00:23:16,571 --> 00:23:17,491
Sarah...

161
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:52,502
Oh, my God!

162
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:45,979
<i>- Satcom 7.
- Central Europe, unsecured.</i>

163
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:51,426
<i>- Designator?
- Bravo, echo, one, one.</i>

164
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:55,513
<i>- This is Kittridge.
- Go secure.</i>

165
00:25:56,264 --> 00:26:01,845
<i>- OK, go ahead.
- This is Ethan Hunt. They're dead.</i>

166
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:07,659
<i>- Who's dead?
- My team. My team is dead!</i>

167
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:14,123
Golitsyn's gone. They knew
we were coming. The disk is gone.

168
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:19,787
<i>- Are you intact?
- The list is in the open!</i>

169
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:24,693
<i>Let's just bring you in safely,
then we'll worry about that.</i>

170
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:30,673
<i>- Were you followed?
- I don't think so.</i>

171
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:34,051
<i>Don't think. Be sure.
Are you clean?</i>

172
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:35,645
Yes.

173
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:39,909
<i>Location Green, one hour.
I'll be there myself.</i>

174
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:43,822
<i>- You're in Prague?
- One hour.</i>

175
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:45,690
I... I can't tell you how sorry I am.

176
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:50,720
I know how much Jim,
in particular, meant to you.

177
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:55,577
- Personally as well as professionally.
- Yeah...

178
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,992
Here's a passport and visa. Usual drill.

179
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:07,687
We'll work the exfiltration
through Canada

180
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:13,068
and throw the Prague police a bone,
toss them a few suspects.

181
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:21,928
- You follow me?
- Yeah, I follow.

182
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:29,919
- We've lost enough agents for tonight.
- You mean, "I" have.

183
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:37,059
- You're bent on blaming yourself.
- Who else is left?

184
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:44,223
Yeah, I see your point.

185
00:28:47,602 --> 00:28:51,207
- Why was there another team?
- What?

186
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:55,453
Of IMF agents at the embassy tonight.

187
00:28:57,486 --> 00:29:00,033
I don't quite follow you.

188
00:29:02,617 --> 00:29:05,211
Then follow me around the room.

189
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:08,692
The drunk Russians on
the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock.

190
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:18,007
The couple waltzing around me,
the waiter standing behind Hannah.

191
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:22,087
Bow tie at 12 o'clock.
The other IMF team.

192
00:29:22,937 --> 00:29:26,142
You're worried about me. Why?

193
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:34,440
For two years we've been spotting
serious blowback in IMF operations.

194
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,526
We have penetration.

195
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:41,864
We've decoded an Internet message
from a Czech we know as "Max".

196
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:45,326
- The arms dealer.
- That's right.

197
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:53,084
Max has a capacity for anonymity
and for corrupting susceptible agents.

198
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:59,757
He got to someone on the inside,
in a position to buy our NOC list.

199
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:06,898
An operation he called "Job 3-14". He
thought Golitsyn was doing it tonight.

200
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:13,238
- The list he stole was a decoy.
- That's correct.

201
00:30:13,988 --> 00:30:19,244
The actual list is secure at Langley.
Golitsyn was one of ours.

202
00:30:21,362 --> 00:30:25,410
This whole operation was a mole hunt.

203
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:35,261
- The whole operation was a mole hunt.
- Yeah.

204
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,925
The mole's deep inside.

205
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:44,470
And like you said...

206
00:30:47,863 --> 00:30:49,518
...you survived.

207
00:30:52,435 --> 00:30:53,706
I want to show you something.

208
00:30:57,148 --> 00:31:01,969
Since your father's death, your
family's farm has been in receivership.

209
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,240
Suddenly, they have 120 grand
in the bank.

210
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:10,244
His illness was supposed
to have wiped out that account.

211
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:16,010
Dying slowly in America can be
a very expensive proposition.

212
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:24,785
So why don't we quietly get out of here
and onto a plane?

213
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:32,099
- I can understand you're very upset.
- You've never seen me very upset.

214
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,769
Enough is enough.

215
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:39,607
You've bribed and killed,
using loyalties on the inside.

216
00:31:39,857 --> 00:31:44,055
You want to shake hands with the
devil? Fine, but you'll do it in hell.

217
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:47,712
Money, money...
Where's the damn money?

218
00:34:14,971 --> 00:34:19,802
<i>We've decoded an Internet message
from a Czech we know as "Max".</i>

219
00:34:21,352 --> 00:34:26,918
<i>He got in a position to buy our NOC
list. An operation he called "Job 3-14".</i>

220
00:35:23,256 --> 00:35:24,853
Job 3:14...

221
00:35:41,265 --> 00:35:45,055
"...asleep and at rest with kings
and counsellors of the earth..."

222
00:35:48,022 --> 00:35:50,302
You son of a bitch.

223
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,185
Ethan...

224
00:37:33,336 --> 00:37:38,458
What are you doing?
I needed you.

225
00:37:39,008 --> 00:37:40,578
On the bridge.

226
00:37:42,428 --> 00:37:44,550
But you weren't there.

227
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:04,243
- Don't move.
- Ethan...

228
00:38:05,493 --> 00:38:09,782
It's okay. Just calm down.
It's Claire.

229
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:15,671
- You were in the car.
- No, I wasn't.

230
00:38:17,672 --> 00:38:22,769
- I heard on the radio...
- I saw you, you were in the car.

231
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:28,174
No, I got out of the car. I ran to
the bridge. He said someone was...

232
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:33,187
Don't give me that. I was on the bridge.
There was nobody there.

233
00:38:33,437 --> 00:38:38,936
- What happened to Jim?
- Wake up! Jim's dead! They're all dead!

234
00:38:47,243 --> 00:38:49,965
- Who sent you for me?
- Jim's dead...

235
00:38:53,641 --> 00:38:55,513
Take off your coat.

236
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:15,313
I walked away. He said abort.
I just walked away.

237
00:39:15,563 --> 00:39:20,878
That was four hours ago.
Who sent you? Did they send you?

238
00:39:22,528 --> 00:39:26,115
- Who sent you?
- No one sent me.

239
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:30,338
We were supposed to be back here
at four o'clock if we abort.

240
00:39:32,088 --> 00:39:36,876
0400. Four a.m. Four o'clock.
It's four o'clock.

241
00:39:37,126 --> 00:39:41,332
If we abort... four a.m.

242
00:40:01,042 --> 00:40:02,296
I've been disavowed.

243
00:40:09,108 --> 00:40:11,540
They actually think
I killed Jim and everyone else.

244
00:40:18,701 --> 00:40:22,297
Somehow, $100,000 finds its way
into my parents' bank account.

245
00:40:22,947 --> 00:40:28,253
Kittridge assumes I'm the mole,
employed by an arms dealer, Max,

246
00:40:28,803 --> 00:40:32,909
for the last two years,
to get him our NOC list.

247
00:40:35,301 --> 00:40:39,031
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to get it for him.

248
00:40:40,381 --> 00:40:43,635
Ethan, you're not making any sense.

249
00:40:44,886 --> 00:40:49,315
Whoever the mole is,
he goes by the name of Job.

250
00:40:49,766 --> 00:40:54,879
I can't find him, but if he knows
I have the NOC list, he'll find me.

251
00:40:55,529 --> 00:41:00,534
I'm going to go in and tell Kittridge
you have nothing to do with this.

252
00:41:00,785 --> 00:41:06,492
Claire, if you're not dead,
he'll assume you're with me.

253
00:41:22,164 --> 00:41:24,259
The message is for Job.

254
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:29,556
That's right.
And I'm going to answer it.

255
00:41:52,762 --> 00:41:56,718
Excuse me,
could I trouble you for a match?

256
00:42:13,841 --> 00:42:15,579
Remove your hat, please.

257
00:42:19,388 --> 00:42:22,542
- Why?
- You wish to meet Max?

258
00:42:22,992 --> 00:42:25,147
The price of admission.

259
00:42:35,329 --> 00:42:40,427
- I thought I was going to see Max.
- You misunderstood. No one sees Max.

260
00:42:41,477 --> 00:42:47,717
- Then why the hell am I here?
- So he can hear what you have to say.

261
00:42:48,267 --> 00:42:50,754
I don't communicate well
through a shroud.

262
00:42:51,904 --> 00:42:57,420
If Max doesn't like what you say,
you'll be wearing it indefinitely.

263
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:01,300
I'm willing to take the chance.

264
00:43:06,819 --> 00:43:07,965
Very well.

265
00:43:12,708 --> 00:43:16,429
Who are you
and what are you doing here?

266
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:20,618
I need $150,000.

267
00:43:22,301 --> 00:43:23,397
Really?

268
00:43:27,181 --> 00:43:32,770
And you thought if you simply
showed up, I might give it to you?

269
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:37,617
Why not? You gave Job 125.

270
00:43:38,901 --> 00:43:42,982
The penny drops. You are not Job.

271
00:43:45,658 --> 00:43:49,738
Job is not given to quoting scripture
in his communications.

272
00:43:50,788 --> 00:43:57,021
Its tone was aggressive but playful.
Job is not playful.

273
00:43:58,462 --> 00:44:03,884
- So you are something of a paradox.
- Well, that depends.

274
00:44:04,135 --> 00:44:07,898
- On what?
- Whether you like a paradox.

275
00:44:09,832 --> 00:44:15,089
- I want $150,000 today.
- That's quite out of the question.

276
00:44:17,857 --> 00:44:21,169
The disk Job sold you is worthless.

277
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:24,875
It's bait. Part of an internal mole hunt.

278
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:32,190
And how might you know that?

279
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,119
Are you another company man?

280
00:44:38,469 --> 00:44:39,556
Like Job?

281
00:44:44,091 --> 00:44:46,228
We're asking about you.

282
00:44:47,879 --> 00:44:53,109
I'm NOC. Was...
Now disavowed.

283
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:58,556
- Why, may I ask?
- That's what I want to ask Job.

284
00:44:59,106 --> 00:45:04,320
I don't know Job
any more than Job knows me.

285
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:08,366
You could arrange an introduction.

286
00:45:08,616 --> 00:45:12,279
- Why should I?
- I can deliver the actual NOC list.

287
00:45:12,729 --> 00:45:17,745
Your list is worthless, and it's probably
equipped with a homing device.

288
00:45:23,506 --> 00:45:30,305
Boot it up. In 10 minutes you'll have the
CIA hopping around you like rabbits.

289
00:45:33,724 --> 00:45:39,814
It's easy to say it's worthless if I can't
look at it to see if it's worthless.

290
00:45:40,064 --> 00:45:45,328
- Not a tenable position, sir.
- Okay, use it.

291
00:45:45,778 --> 00:45:49,826
But I'd suggest you pack first.

292
00:46:05,339 --> 00:46:10,511
- 26-27. So far, so good.
- Not so good for you, my friend.

293
00:46:10,761 --> 00:46:13,225
I'd say you've got about two minutes.

294
00:46:45,296 --> 00:46:49,853
- 32 and 33.
- Doesn't mean it's a signal.

295
00:46:58,017 --> 00:46:59,872
44 and 45.

296
00:47:48,401 --> 00:47:53,656
The man's gone black, Barnes.
He's under until he decides to surface.

297
00:47:53,906 --> 00:47:59,487
- We can cut off his transportation.
- What can we do, Barnes?

298
00:48:00,238 --> 00:48:04,625
Put a guy at the airport?
How many identities does Hunt have?

299
00:48:04,875 --> 00:48:07,563
How many times
has he slipped past customs?

300
00:48:08,913 --> 00:48:13,609
These guys are trained to be ghosts.
We taught them!

301
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,596
What do you suggest?

302
00:48:17,847 --> 00:48:20,934
Let's make him come to us.

303
00:48:21,684 --> 00:48:27,975
You find something that's personally
important to him and you squeeze.

304
00:48:33,487 --> 00:48:37,043
Günther will never let me
have one of his apartments again.

305
00:48:38,993 --> 00:48:44,374
- Sorry I doubted you, dear boy.
- Thanks, Max.

306
00:48:45,524 --> 00:48:47,253
Or is it Maxine?

307
00:48:49,003 --> 00:48:53,641
I don't have to tell you what a comfort
anonymity is in my profession.

308
00:48:54,592 --> 00:48:57,172
It's like a warm blanket.

309
00:49:00,857 --> 00:49:06,664
My deal with Job was subject to
a successful boot scan. The deal's off.

310
00:49:08,606 --> 00:49:12,635
- What was your deal with Job?
- Six million dollars.

311
00:49:12,985 --> 00:49:17,865
I'll give you the same, for the
complete list, not just Eastern Europe.

312
00:49:18,115 --> 00:49:22,036
I won't do this piecemeal.
It's too dangerous.

313
00:49:22,286 --> 00:49:28,535
10 million, in negotiable US Treasury
certificates, coupons attached.

314
00:49:29,385 --> 00:49:30,963
And one more thing...

315
00:49:32,613 --> 00:49:37,761
Your personal assurance
that Job will be at the exchange.

316
00:49:53,743 --> 00:50:00,010
- Max made a deal with you?
- I deliver the list, Max delivers Job.

317
00:50:02,952 --> 00:50:07,415
We've 75 rounds for the Beretta,
but only 20 for the Sig-Sauer.

318
00:50:07,665 --> 00:50:10,744
One pair of Visco glasses.

319
00:50:11,394 --> 00:50:13,657
Plenty of passports...

320
00:50:18,259 --> 00:50:25,050
Well, you said it yourself.
If I'm not dead, I'm with you.

321
00:50:26,434 --> 00:50:30,146
- Are you sure?
- Jim was my husband.

322
00:50:30,396 --> 00:50:33,167
I want to get the son of a bitch
who did this.

323
00:50:35,317 --> 00:50:41,665
- We need help. They'll have to be local.
- What kind of help?

324
00:51:15,533 --> 00:51:19,137
Simple game. Four players.

325
00:51:19,688 --> 00:51:24,167
Exfil opens the pocket,
Cyber Ops lifts the wallet.

326
00:51:24,817 --> 00:51:28,213
- Bank?
- IMF mainframe.

327
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:33,036
- Where exactly is it?
- In Langley.

328
00:51:36,128 --> 00:51:40,634
In Langley?
The one in Virginia?

329
00:51:41,634 --> 00:51:44,437
Inside CIA headquarters at Langley?

330
00:51:45,388 --> 00:51:49,334
- Is he serious?
- Always.

331
00:51:51,227 --> 00:51:55,022
Why don't we drop by Fort Knox?

332
00:51:55,272 --> 00:51:59,485
I can fly a helicopter into the vault.

333
00:51:59,735 --> 00:52:03,614
It would be easier
than breaking into the CIA.

334
00:52:03,864 --> 00:52:09,413
- What kind of information is it?
- Profitable.

335
00:52:10,579 --> 00:52:14,375
Payment on delivery.

336
00:52:14,625 --> 00:52:18,231
I don't know.
I just don't know.

337
00:52:20,381 --> 00:52:23,977
This doesn't sound like
the Luther Stickell I heard of.

338
00:52:24,927 --> 00:52:28,690
What did they used to call you?
The Net Ranger?

339
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,518
The only man to hack NATO Ghostcom.

340
00:52:32,768 --> 00:52:36,674
There was never any evidence
that I had anything to do with that...

341
00:52:38,524 --> 00:52:42,329
...with that exceptional piece of work.

342
00:52:45,656 --> 00:52:51,120
You don't know what you're missing.
This is the Mount Everest of hacks.

343
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:57,960
You're kidding yourselves. Even with
top-of-the-line crypto, Stu 3s...

344
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:03,299
- Krieger can get it. Right?
- It may take a little time.

345
00:53:03,549 --> 00:53:07,219
That's not what Claire says about you.

346
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:10,557
Thinking Machine laptops.

347
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:16,929
The 686 prototypes,
with the artificial intelligence Risc chip.

348
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,032
24 hours.

349
00:53:20,483 --> 00:53:24,904
And I get to keep the equipment
when we're done.

350
00:53:25,154 --> 00:53:27,902
Luther,
I guess you're all out of excuses.

351
00:53:32,995 --> 00:53:36,916
Look, I just can't hack my way inside.

352
00:53:37,166 --> 00:53:43,297
No modem access to a mainframe.
It's in what we call a "stand-alone".

353
00:53:43,547 --> 00:53:48,311
Which means I'd have to be
physically at the terminal.

354
00:53:49,261 --> 00:53:53,099
Relax, it's much worse than you think.

355
00:53:53,349 --> 00:53:56,102
It's in a black vault lock-down.

356
00:53:56,352 --> 00:54:01,375
<i>The only person allowed in the room
has to pass through security checks.</i>

357
00:54:03,025 --> 00:54:06,932
<i>The first is a voiceprint identification
and a six-digit access code.</i>

358
00:54:11,075 --> 00:54:13,420
<i>This only gets him into the outer room.</i>

359
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:17,167
<i>Next he has to pass a retinal scan.</i>

360
00:54:20,543 --> 00:54:26,499
<i>And the intrusion countermeasures are
deactivated by an electronic key card.</i>

361
00:54:27,049 --> 00:54:29,153
Which we won't have.

362
00:54:30,803 --> 00:54:37,535
<i>Inside the black vault, three systems
operate whenever the technician is out.</i>

363
00:54:38,185 --> 00:54:42,933
<i>The first is sound sensitive.
Anything above a whisper sets it off.</i>

364
00:54:44,483 --> 00:54:47,737
<i>The second system detects
any increase in temperature.</i>

365
00:54:47,987 --> 00:54:53,811
<i>The body heat of an intruder will trigger
it if the temperature rises one degree.</i>

366
00:54:59,165 --> 00:55:03,627
<i>That temperature is controlled
by the air conditioning duct,</i>

367
00:55:03,878 --> 00:55:05,398
<i>30 feet above the floor.</i>

368
00:55:06,048 --> 00:55:08,811
<i>That vent is guarded by a laser net.</i>

369
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:17,292
<i>The third system is on the floor
and is pressure sensitive.</i>

370
00:55:18,642 --> 00:55:21,738
<i>The slightest increase in weight
will trigger the alarm.</i>

371
00:55:23,189 --> 00:55:28,295
<i>If any one of these systems is set off,
it will activate an automatic lock-down.</i>

372
00:55:29,445 --> 00:55:35,836
<i>Believe me when I tell you,
all three systems are state of the art.</i>

373
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:42,135
And you really think we can do this?

374
00:55:45,785 --> 00:55:47,289
We're going to do it.

375
00:56:20,329 --> 00:56:22,940
Alarms in sectors 3, 7 and 12.

376
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:28,129
<i>- What sector's the air conditioning?
- 21. But there's no alarm in 21.</i>

377
00:56:28,379 --> 00:56:30,633
<i>I have to get in and shut it down.</i>

378
00:56:34,928 --> 00:56:39,249
<i>No one goes into any sector where the
alarm hasn't gone off, and it hasn't...</i>

379
00:56:39,299 --> 00:56:40,327
Wait.

380
00:56:44,812 --> 00:56:47,159
<i>- It's gone off. Let's go.
- Let's move.</i>

381
00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:02,732
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thank you.

382
00:57:05,424 --> 00:57:07,087
21 's through here.

383
00:57:14,508 --> 00:57:18,154
- He's recruiting. For what purpose?
- Survival.

384
00:57:18,504 --> 00:57:23,526
Too short-sighted. This guy initiates.
The question is, what does he want?

385
00:57:23,976 --> 00:57:27,631
Where does he need to get it?
Barnes, what the hell is that noise?

386
00:57:28,981 --> 00:57:34,880
- Fire alarm, Gene.
- Do we have to evacuate?

387
00:58:22,326 --> 00:58:25,006
Hey, where's the other guy?

388
00:58:28,541 --> 00:58:31,737
- Zero body count.
- We'll see.

389
01:00:05,388 --> 01:00:06,584
Hi, there.

390
01:01:07,533 --> 01:01:11,538
One, two, three.

391
01:01:12,288 --> 01:01:15,524
Toast, toast.

392
01:01:15,875 --> 01:01:21,297
<i>- Check.
- Good. Okay, Luther, I'm going in.</i>

393
01:01:21,547 --> 01:01:24,770
<i>Everest, man.
You ready to plant the flag?</i>

394
01:01:32,767 --> 01:01:38,548
- Damn.
- Krieger, from now on, total silence.

395
01:02:54,682 --> 01:02:55,936
He's rolling to you.

396
01:03:00,312 --> 01:03:03,551
- He's at the voiceprint corridor.
- William Donloe.

397
01:03:20,041 --> 01:03:21,053
Outer room.

398
01:03:25,555 --> 01:03:27,668
He's coming in the vault.

399
01:03:32,928 --> 01:03:34,316
Come on, move.

400
01:05:03,394 --> 01:05:04,757
He's in the bathroom.

401
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:24,625
A-W-9-

402
01:06:24,975 --> 01:06:27,579
<i>6-B-6.</i>

403
01:06:46,372 --> 01:06:48,249
Holy mother of God.

404
01:06:48,499 --> 01:06:50,869
<i>A NOC list.</i>

405
01:09:47,595 --> 01:09:49,358
He's at the vault.

406
01:10:02,693 --> 01:10:03,988
Four yellows.

407
01:10:07,448 --> 01:10:08,294
One red.

408
01:10:19,769 --> 01:10:20,990
Get moving.

409
01:10:22,591 --> 01:10:23,491
Toast.

410
01:10:25,091 --> 01:10:26,087
Toast.

411
01:11:29,104 --> 01:11:30,483
Oh, my God.

412
01:11:46,505 --> 01:11:51,070
- It's for you.
- Kittridge.

413
01:12:14,158 --> 01:12:18,287
You and I know about this.
That's where it stops.

414
01:12:18,537 --> 01:12:21,999
- It never happened.
- What about him?

415
01:12:22,249 --> 01:12:27,489
I want him manning a radar tower
in Alaska by the end of the day.

416
01:13:06,836 --> 01:13:10,626
Are you contacting your buyer?
Ethan?

417
01:13:25,271 --> 01:13:26,058
Ethan?

418
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:31,672
Oh, excuse me. "Mr Hunt".

419
01:13:41,287 --> 01:13:43,575
You're not going to any meeting
without me.

420
01:13:46,125 --> 01:13:49,113
My contact is extremely shy.

421
01:13:51,255 --> 01:13:53,743
I don't think you're in any position
to give orders.

422
01:13:55,593 --> 01:13:58,888
- Not while I'm holding this.
- Krieger...

423
01:13:59,138 --> 01:14:01,008
Shut up.

424
01:14:05,728 --> 01:14:09,190
- You mean this?
- That's not the list.

425
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:12,587
You've never seen this trick?

426
01:14:20,409 --> 01:14:21,963
Where did it go?

427
01:14:26,165 --> 01:14:27,551
It's gone.

428
01:14:29,001 --> 01:14:32,631
- What?
- You... no?

429
01:14:39,595 --> 01:14:41,141
But not too far.

430
01:14:45,017 --> 01:14:46,970
I know what you're thinking.

431
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:52,752
"In the computer room, I was up here
and he was down there."

432
01:14:54,902 --> 01:14:59,625
"He was carrying two disks."

433
01:15:02,451 --> 01:15:06,649
- It's hard to keep track of these things.
- Where is it?

434
01:15:22,138 --> 01:15:25,108
Do you actually think
I'd let you have the NOC list?

435
01:15:26,559 --> 01:15:30,174
Try any sleight of hand with my money
and I'll cut your throat.

436
01:15:57,256 --> 01:16:01,635
<i>- On a cushy recruiting assignment?
- Did they put you up at the Plaza?</i>

437
01:16:01,886 --> 01:16:04,065
<i>Drake Hotel, Chicago.</i>

438
01:16:06,215 --> 01:16:08,078
I'm so sorry.

439
01:16:14,273 --> 01:16:16,387
Krieger was my call.

440
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:24,186
I'm sorry, Ethan.

441
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:31,692
We did what we had to do.

442
01:16:33,542 --> 01:16:36,889
I'm going to try and get some sleep.

443
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:17,306
Krieger did have the NOC list?

444
01:17:26,637 --> 01:17:32,978
Hold on to it. If you knew what you were
getting into, you wouldn't have done it.

445
01:17:38,691 --> 01:17:41,419
I'm not going to let this
get out in the open.

446
01:17:42,570 --> 01:17:48,694
Exactly. That's your job tomorrow on
the train. Don't let it get out in the open.

447
01:17:55,583 --> 01:18:01,464
- What is the range of this thing?
- It's hard to tell. I'll have to be close.

448
01:18:06,135 --> 01:18:10,848
<i>The unlikely setting, a farm in the
heartland of America, Wisconsin.</i>

449
01:18:11,098 --> 01:18:15,561
<i>Here, Federal agents found the brains
behind an international drug ring:</i>

450
01:18:15,811 --> 01:18:20,941
<i>Margaret Ethan Hunt and her
brother-in-law, Donald Hunt.</i>

451
01:18:21,192 --> 01:18:26,530
<i>They were arrested this morning
in a major sting operation</i>

452
01:18:26,781 --> 01:18:32,495
<i>designed to expose the
illegal manufacture of the drug "khat".</i>

453
01:18:32,745 --> 01:18:36,749
<i>- We have here a case...
- Kittridge.</i>

454
01:19:06,445 --> 01:19:08,781
I see you've been out visiting the folks.

455
01:19:09,031 --> 01:19:12,326
It's Hunt.
What do you need for a pinpoint?

456
01:19:12,576 --> 01:19:15,579
Been watching a little TV?

457
01:19:17,030 --> 01:19:20,918
Hauling Mom off to jail in shackles
was an especially nice touch.

458
01:19:21,168 --> 01:19:23,671
- He's in England.
- Get Ml5.

459
01:19:23,921 --> 01:19:28,467
My first order of business
after you come in

460
01:19:28,718 --> 01:19:32,807
is to have these ridiculous charges
against your family dropped.

461
01:19:35,057 --> 01:19:37,852
If you come in now,

462
01:19:38,102 --> 01:19:41,582
<i>we can play down
the charges against you as well.</i>

463
01:19:43,232 --> 01:19:47,862
- Can I ask you something, Kittridge?
- Certainly, Ethan.

464
01:19:48,112 --> 01:19:50,364
If you're dealing with someone

465
01:19:50,614 --> 01:19:53,701
<i>who's crushed, stabbed,</i>

466
01:19:53,951 --> 01:19:56,662
shot and detonated

467
01:19:56,912 --> 01:20:01,250
<i>five members of his own IMF team,</i>

468
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:06,756
how devastated will you make him
by arresting Ma and Uncle Donald?

469
01:20:07,006 --> 01:20:10,304
<i>I don't know, Ethan.
Why don't you tell me?</i>

470
01:20:13,554 --> 01:20:17,725
Lost him.
We needed three more seconds.

471
01:20:17,975 --> 01:20:21,256
He wanted us to know
he was in London.

472
01:20:34,325 --> 01:20:36,129
You're a hard man to catch up with.

473
01:20:45,169 --> 01:20:48,731
The next day I dragged myself
back to the safe house.

474
01:20:49,382 --> 01:20:53,636
- I checked our aliases.
- And you picked us up in the States.

475
01:20:53,886 --> 01:20:57,181
But you'd gone,
and I could check just so many places.

476
01:20:57,431 --> 01:21:00,194
Smaller countries
don't computerise customs records.

477
01:21:00,295 --> 01:21:01,795
So I watched Europe.

478
01:21:02,144 --> 01:21:05,523
Once you turned up in England,
it was easy.

479
01:21:05,773 --> 01:21:10,570
- You know I like Liverpool St. Rentals.
- I showed them to you.

480
01:21:12,421 --> 01:21:14,649
I remember.

481
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:21,122
A doctor's got to look at that.
You can't sit up straight.

482
01:21:21,372 --> 01:21:27,114
I can sit up straight. I just can't
sit up straight very well. Sit down.

483
01:21:30,339 --> 01:21:35,177
Ethan... I saw who shot me.

484
01:21:35,428 --> 01:21:37,622
I saw the mole.

485
01:21:38,472 --> 01:21:41,959
- It was Kittridge.
- Kittridge...

486
01:21:42,309 --> 01:21:44,964
Kittridge, Ethan!

487
01:21:49,984 --> 01:21:54,957
Kittridge is the mole.
My God. Of course, you're right.

488
01:22:00,953 --> 01:22:02,883
He was at the embassy that night.

489
01:22:06,333 --> 01:22:10,814
First he took out Jack, at the elevator.

490
01:22:18,054 --> 01:22:20,325
He shot you on the bridge.

491
01:23:05,059 --> 01:23:08,440
He must have had back-up to take out
Golitsyn and Sarah at the fence.

492
01:23:27,164 --> 01:23:29,670
How did he do Hannah?

493
01:23:54,150 --> 01:23:58,605
No, he could've done Hannah himself.

494
01:24:24,638 --> 01:24:28,769
Why, Jim? Why?

495
01:24:31,979 --> 01:24:35,776
When you think about it,
it was inevitable. No more Cold War.

496
01:24:37,526 --> 01:24:43,057
No more secrets to keep
from everyone but yourself.

497
01:24:43,908 --> 01:24:49,606
Then suddenly the President is running
the country without your permission.

498
01:24:50,456 --> 01:24:56,104
The son of a bitch, how dare he?
And you realise it's over.

499
01:24:56,754 --> 01:25:03,053
You're obsolete hardware, with
a lousy marriage and 62 grand a year.

500
01:25:04,553 --> 01:25:09,843
Kittridge. We'll go after
the no-good son of a bitch, big time.

501
01:25:14,647 --> 01:25:18,951
We won't have to.
He'll come after us.

502
01:25:19,402 --> 01:25:24,190
- What's going to make him do that?
- What he didn't get in Prague.

503
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:26,419
The NOC list.

504
01:25:28,369 --> 01:25:31,372
Jesus, Ethan.

505
01:25:32,922 --> 01:25:34,893
Good for you.

506
01:25:36,043 --> 01:25:43,175
- We meet tomorrow, the TGV to Paris.
- Tight security. No guns. Real plus.

507
01:25:43,426 --> 01:25:48,264
I deliver the NOC list to Max,
Max delivers Job to me.

508
01:25:48,514 --> 01:25:54,088
Claire and Luther will be on the train.
Krieger will have a helicopter in Paris.

509
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:58,494
Jim?

510
01:26:07,908 --> 01:26:10,580
I was in a café, waiting for you...

511
01:26:13,530 --> 01:26:15,207
...and there she was.

512
01:26:16,058 --> 01:26:21,915
Standing in the rain, alive and beautiful,
thinking I'm dead and gone.

513
01:26:25,134 --> 01:26:30,124
God knows what she's had to do
to forget me, to keep going.

514
01:26:34,685 --> 01:26:38,522
She can't know about me. No one can.
Not till this is over.

515
01:26:38,773 --> 01:26:43,887
- You're probably right.
- There's too much at stake.

516
01:26:46,037 --> 01:26:48,876
Once we leave the safe house,
you get in there and crash.

517
01:26:50,626 --> 01:26:54,073
- I'll call from Paris.
- You got it.

518
01:27:17,011 --> 01:27:18,499
What happened?

519
01:27:22,650 --> 01:27:24,439
I sent the message to Max.

520
01:27:28,948 --> 01:27:30,645
We're on for tomorrow.

521
01:27:38,190 --> 01:27:39,461
Okay.

522
01:27:50,077 --> 01:27:51,406
Come here.

523
01:28:35,071 --> 01:28:37,016
- What's this?
- Incoming for you.

524
01:28:37,266 --> 01:28:39,846
X-ray's clean. No explosives.

525
01:28:51,389 --> 01:28:52,843
Gene.

526
01:28:56,911 --> 01:29:00,498
- How long to the London terminus?
- 25 minutes.

527
01:29:00,748 --> 01:29:02,459
We've got 10!

528
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:44,476
<i>- Give me Max.
- It's him.</i>

529
01:29:48,045 --> 01:29:52,967
<i>- This was not what we discussed.
- My apologies. It couldn't be helped.</i>

530
01:29:53,217 --> 01:29:56,697
<i>You'll find the disk under your seat.</i>

531
01:30:31,690 --> 01:30:38,262
Dear boy, I hope this doesn't preclude
a meeting in private.

532
01:30:38,512 --> 01:30:43,976
<i>- Not if you tell me where the money is.
- The mere chance is worth 10 million.</i>

533
01:30:44,226 --> 01:30:50,107
Baggage car, rack 3,
silver briefcase, combination 3-1-4.

534
01:30:50,358 --> 01:30:56,106
<i>- What about Job?
- I wouldn't worry, he'll find you.</i>

535
01:31:13,714 --> 01:31:17,009
- What's the matter?
- It's not transmitting.

536
01:31:17,259 --> 01:31:21,091
We've got to get this through
before we hit the chunnel.

537
01:31:34,318 --> 01:31:37,098
<i>- What's the problem?
- Connection denied.</i>

538
01:31:39,448 --> 01:31:43,069
- Did you check the batteries?
- I always check the batteries.

539
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:45,716
Run it through from the top.

540
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:52,729
We don't know what Max looks like.

541
01:31:53,379 --> 01:31:59,153
If he's got that list, he'll want
to check it. That means laptops.

542
01:32:10,479 --> 01:32:13,359
Excuse me, sir. Your telephone.

543
01:32:19,789 --> 01:32:23,671
- Is everything all right?
- It's working.

544
01:32:36,630 --> 01:32:38,142
He's in the baggage car.

545
01:32:40,092 --> 01:32:46,251
<i>- Ethan, Kittridge is on the train.
- I'll meet you in the baggage car.</i>

546
01:33:03,432 --> 01:33:04,261
Barnes.

547
01:33:42,738 --> 01:33:47,735
Ethan's right behind me.
Listen, Jim...

548
01:33:48,585 --> 01:33:51,023
Is it such a good idea to kill him?

549
01:33:54,542 --> 01:33:56,154
Kittridge is here.

550
01:34:00,047 --> 01:34:04,036
We take the money,
Ethan takes the blame.

551
01:34:06,554 --> 01:34:08,399
No one else has seen you alive.

552
01:34:11,267 --> 01:34:13,404
No one will believe him.

553
01:34:41,297 --> 01:34:45,279
Of course, I'm very sorry
to hear you say that, Claire.

554
01:34:49,221 --> 01:34:54,995
- Ethan.
- Yes, Ethan Hunt. You remember him.

555
01:34:58,022 --> 01:35:01,118
- You knew about Jim?
- Of course.

556
01:35:03,069 --> 01:35:07,531
"When" he knew is a good question.
Mind telling me, Ethan?

557
01:35:08,982 --> 01:35:11,436
Before or after I showed up in London?

558
01:35:12,286 --> 01:35:17,217
Before London. After you took the Bible
from the Drake Hotel in Chicago.

559
01:35:18,417 --> 01:35:22,055
They stamped it, didn't they?
Damned Gideons.

560
01:35:23,005 --> 01:35:26,842
Ethan, if you knew about Jim, why...?

561
01:35:27,093 --> 01:35:30,672
Why the masquerade?
Why take the risk?

562
01:35:32,223 --> 01:35:36,602
You've asked the question...
and you are the answer.

563
01:35:37,452 --> 01:35:41,457
- I knew about Jim.
- But he didn't know about you.

564
01:35:42,108 --> 01:35:46,863
Claire was never convinced
her charms would work on you.

565
01:35:47,613 --> 01:35:51,143
But I was confident,
having tasted the goods.

566
01:35:53,369 --> 01:35:58,008
"Thou shalt not covet
thy neighbour's wife."

567
01:36:00,292 --> 01:36:04,889
- Let's just get the money and get out.
- Yes, let's get the money.

568
01:36:05,139 --> 01:36:08,553
Ethan, the money.

569
01:36:10,803 --> 01:36:12,325
Give her the money.

570
01:36:15,975 --> 01:36:17,322
You've earned it.

571
01:36:25,151 --> 01:36:29,989
- All 10 million.
- Claire was wrong about one thing.

572
01:36:30,239 --> 01:36:33,985
Oh, what's that?

573
01:36:52,553 --> 01:36:54,915
Good morning, Mr Phelps.

574
01:36:56,265 --> 01:36:59,145
I'm not the only one
who's seen you alive.

575
01:37:01,937 --> 01:37:06,551
- You son of a bitch.
- It's over, Jim.

576
01:37:12,281 --> 01:37:16,653
- Don't. Don't, Jim.
- "Don't, Jim"?

577
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:36,713
No, it's in the tunnel.
He'll crash into us! Accelerate!

578
01:40:36,814 --> 01:40:38,014
Accelerate!

579
01:42:40,026 --> 01:42:43,522
Red light... green light.

580
01:43:36,540 --> 01:43:38,846
I think this is what you're looking for.

581
01:43:45,341 --> 01:43:47,393
Hello, Max.

582
01:43:47,843 --> 01:43:53,432
My lawyers will have a field day with it.
Entrapment, jurisdictional conflict...

583
01:43:53,683 --> 01:43:57,397
Maybe we'll just leave the courts
out of this one.

584
01:43:59,730 --> 01:44:04,985
I'm sure we can find
something I have that you need.

585
01:44:05,194 --> 01:44:09,532
<i>A helicopter lost altitude,
veered into a tunnel,</i>

586
01:44:09,782 --> 01:44:13,577
<i>and collided with a high-speed train.</i>

587
01:44:13,828 --> 01:44:17,510
<i>The pilot was killed,
but no one on the train was hurt...</i>

588
01:44:22,086 --> 01:44:25,873
- You call your folks? How do they feel?
- About what?

589
01:44:26,424 --> 01:44:31,763
The Justice Department apology,
VIP treatment, the whole nine yards.

590
01:44:33,014 --> 01:44:40,239
My mom didn't know how the DEA
mistook them for drug smugglers.

591
01:44:43,315 --> 01:44:47,319
- Cheers.
- To you, Luther.

592
01:44:47,570 --> 01:44:52,509
- And being off the disavowed list.
- Hey, I'm the flavour of the month.

593
01:44:54,618 --> 01:44:56,589
Why don't you come back with me?

594
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:02,562
I just don't know why
I'd be doing it.

595
01:45:05,421 --> 01:45:10,936
I've got to catch my flight...
How does it feel to be a solid citizen?

596
01:45:12,970 --> 01:45:18,852
Man, I don't know.
I'm going to miss being disreputable.

597
01:45:19,602 --> 01:45:24,642
If it makes you feel any better,
I'll always think of you that way.

598
01:45:35,618 --> 01:45:37,288
Excuse me, Mr Hunt.

599
01:45:39,038 --> 01:45:41,008
Would you like to watch a movie?

600
01:45:42,458 --> 01:45:45,628
Oh, no thank you.

601
01:45:46,378 --> 01:45:49,709
Would you consider the cinema
of the Caribbean?

602
01:45:51,759 --> 01:45:53,505
Aruba, perhaps.
