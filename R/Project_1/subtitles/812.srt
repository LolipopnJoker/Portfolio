1607

I know you know
a lot of people...

1608
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:55,280
and with a good lawyer,
you'll get out of jail

1609
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:56,446
in a few years.

1610
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:58,921
And then I'll come for you.

1611
01:45:59,120 --> 01:46:01,088
I'll find you.

1612
01:46:01,240 --> 01:46:02,765
And we both know
what's gonna happen.

DOTZLER: <i>I knew
from the beginning.</i>

1618
01:46:55,320 --> 01:46:57,163
It was the bagels.

1619
01:46:57,880 --> 01:46:59,689
They were warm.

1620
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:00,887
I had to ask myself...

1621
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:04,681
what kind of guy
goes out for warm bagels...

1622
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:07,161
and comes back
and commits murder?

1623
01:47:07,320 --> 01:47:11,166
So, I compared the timestamps
to the deleted texts...

1624
01:47:12,040 --> 01:47:14,327
that you downloaded
from our computers.

1625
01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:17,881
Which, by the way,
is illegal, and I could
arrest you for it.

1626
01:47:18,160 --> 01:47:20,686
I could.
But it's got me.

1627
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:23,807
And I was able
to figure it out.

1628
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:25,841
She was leaving him.

1629
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:29,525
He needed the insurance money
to pay Malankov.

1630
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:32,280
You didn't help us out
by escaping, you know.

1631
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:35,284
He figured,
what better way

1632
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:37,480
to get rid of Malankov and
keep the insurance money...

1633
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:40,091
than by getting me

1634
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:42,049
to kill the guy
who would kill him...

1635
01:47:42,680 --> 01:47:45,843
because it was the only way
to keep my daughter safe.

1636
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:48,371
Almost worked.

1637
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,684
Almost.

1638
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:56,205
So, are we done, Inspector?

1639
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:58,041
Of course.

1640
01:47:59,200 --> 01:48:00,247
Of course we're done.

1643
01:48:09,160 --> 01:48:10,730
just stay in town
for the next month or so...

1644
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:12,800

I've thought
about this all night.

1650
01:48:54,120 --> 01:48:55,963
It's a very
important choice.

1651
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:57,965
Whatever you decide...

said the same thing, too.

Tell him.

we've been talking.

1657

We thought that...

1658
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:19,921
if it's a girl...

1659
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:24,286
we'd like to
name her after mom.
