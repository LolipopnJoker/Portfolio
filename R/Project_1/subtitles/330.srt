- Hey, Coach, how you been?
- [Laughing] Lynn Swann.

7
00:01:08,877 --> 00:01:10,756
Now why ain't I surprised...

8
00:01:10,836 --> 00:01:13,636
to see you snoopin' around my
football field first day of practice?

9
00:01:13,716 --> 00:01:15,476
Well, that's because you got
a good-lookin' football team.

10
00:01:15,556 --> 00:01:19,075
Maybe good enough to add another
national championship trophy
to the old case downstairs.

11
00:01:19,155 --> 00:01:21,995
That's kinda like my old man
told me one time, Lynn.

"The only thing better than a crawfish
dinner is five crawfish dinners."

It's clean.

It's cold.

16
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:06,109
Now that's what I call
high-quality H2O. Oh!

17
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:08,988
Ooh!
Right in the head!

18

It's over there!

legendary green playbook of yours, Red?

squirrelled away in there...

don't-don't waste any water.

doin' here? Huh, huh?

Didn't I tell you as plain as I could
speak to get rid of his ass last year?

37
00:03:31,096 --> 00:03:34,616
Yes, sir, but I didn't think
you were serious, Coach.
Besides, he does a great job.

Mama, s-somethin' bad
happened today.

55
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:43,846
Somebody hurt you, my boy? Who hurt
you? You tell Mama who hurt you.

56
00:04:43,886 --> 00:04:45,766
Nobody, Mama.
It's just that...

57
00:04:45,806 --> 00:04:49,685
I lost my position as the team's
water distribution engineer.

I-I was... I was thinkin', Mama,
maybe I-I could...

62
00:05:02,123 --> 00:05:06,043
I could try to-to get another
waterboy job for-for a different team.

63
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,402
Don't you raise your voice
to me, Bobby Boucher.

64
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:11,202
I-I wasn't raising
my voice, Mama.

65
00:05:11,282 --> 00:05:13,962
I don't like confrontation
'cause I'm a Virgo.

66
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:16,921
Who told you
you was a Virgo?

67

69
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,600
Bobby Boucher! Don't you remember
what your mama told you about girls?

70
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,519
I remember, Mama.

71
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:34,839
A girl was so nice out at
Wasser's Creek this morning.

72
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:38,558
- Really?
- We looked for crawfish together.
Her's name's Vicki.

73

I don't ever want you
associatin' with little girls.

- Why not, Mama?
- Because little girls are the devil!

Mama, it-it's just
that I'm a waterboy.

76
00:05:48,077 --> 00:05:50,117
The team gets thirsty,
and I bring them the water.

77
00:05:50,196 --> 00:05:52,876
They-They need the water, and I likes
to be the one that brings it to them.

78
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:56,396
Yeah. They like to give you a boot
in the patoot for all your trouble.

79
00:05:56,476 --> 00:06:01,475
Bobby, you don't have what they call
"the social skills."

80
00:06:01,555 --> 00:06:06,474
People don't understand you.
That's why you never have any
friends, except for your mama.

Next Friday, August 29,

of whoop-ass on Herculon,

83
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:15,593

whatever galaxy it is he came from.

as you like to say...

- you seem to be sweating
quite profusely.
- Yeah?

93

perhaps, you might need...

This is the play.
This is the play. Okay?

The quarterback. Two receivers
lined up to the left, one to the right.

126
00:08:49,171 --> 00:08:51,491
There's a flanker lined up to the left
behind the quarterback.

- Oh, okay.
- He gives the ball...
No, he doesn't get the ball.

The receiver goes
all the way over there to the left.

129
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:01,689
Once the quarterback has the ball,
he fakes to the left.

130

No. He fakes to the right.
He doesn't fake.

than what I serve.

- That is the water that
you serve to your players?
- Uh-huh.

Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He has
his good days and his bad days.

166
00:11:54,384 --> 00:11:56,464
Used to be an assistant coach
at some big football school,

167
00:11:56,544 --> 00:11:58,384
but he had a mental breakdown
or something.

168
00:11:58,464 --> 00:12:00,944
Don't worry.
He'll snap out of it.

169
00:12:01,024 --> 00:12:03,823
- Let me know when it
cools down, baby. All right.
- Yes.

170
00:12:03,903 --> 00:12:06,263

171
00:12:06,303 --> 00:12:08,902
[Panting]

172
00:12:08,982 --> 00:12:12,222
Hey, did you all get a load
of the new waterboy?

173
00:12:13,782 --> 00:12:16,661
Let's make him feel right at home.
Jerry, go right.

174
00:12:16,741 --> 00:12:19,941
Casey, go left.
Way left.

175
00:12:19,981 --> 00:12:21,981
- On one. Ready?
- [All] Break!

176
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,899
Set! Red, 22!

177
00:12:30,979 --> 00:12:34,699
Red, 22! Hut!

178
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:39,978
[Grunting]

- [Cheering]
- [Laughing]

180
00:12:45,617 --> 00:12:50,136
l-I-I-I think you zigged
when you should've zagged on that play.

181
00:12:50,216 --> 00:12:53,976
- Sorry.
- Hey, Waterboy, check this out.

182
00:12:57,255 --> 00:13:00,695
[All Laughing]

183
00:13:03,855 --> 00:13:06,454
[Laughing Continues]

184
00:13:13,413 --> 00:13:16,173
Hey, Waterboy!
Check this out.

185
00:13:18,692 --> 00:13:20,932
- [Laughing]
- [Grunting]

186
00:13:21,012 --> 00:13:23,212
- Yes.
- [Grunting Continues]

187
00:13:23,252 --> 00:13:25,171
Well, my, my, my.

188
00:13:25,251 --> 00:13:29,011
Was my little aquatic engineer about
to bash one of my football players?

189
00:13:29,091 --> 00:13:31,651
Well, he spit
in the c-c-cooler.

190
00:13:31,731 --> 00:13:35,130
He happens to be
a finely tuned athletic machine.

191
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:39,809
And I ain't gonna have him hit
in the head by some idiot waterboy.

192
00:13:39,849 --> 00:13:43,289
[Echoing]
Do you understand me?

193
00:13:43,369 --> 00:13:45,489
- Are you all right?
- What? I wasn't gonna
do nothin', Coach.

194
00:13:45,569 --> 00:13:48,448
Well, you better do something.
You gotta defend yourself here, Bobby.

195
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:51,648
But they're-they're-they're
finely tuned athletic machines.

196
00:13:51,728 --> 00:13:54,567
I am not telling you
to go on a shooting rampage.

197
00:13:54,647 --> 00:13:57,887
But you have to stand up
for yourself, or they're
gonna ride you all season long.

198
00:13:57,927 --> 00:14:00,886
Believe me,
I've seen it myself.

199
00:14:05,686 --> 00:14:08,965
Hey, moron!

200
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:15,084
Hey! Moron! Duh!

201
00:14:15,124 --> 00:14:18,524
[lmitating Bobby]
L-Look at me. I'm the w-w-waterboy.

202
00:14:18,604 --> 00:14:23,963
Duh! I got
a wooden spoon. Duh!

203
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:28,002
Smell like you could use
a shower, stinky. [Cackling]

204
00:14:29,122 --> 00:14:31,722
You're fired!
[Cackling]

205
00:14:32,762 --> 00:14:35,881
[Both Laughing]

206
00:14:35,961 --> 00:14:38,121
Stop makin' fun of me.

207
00:14:39,161 --> 00:14:42,160
Red, ready! Hut!

208
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,920
- Wow!
- Damn!

209
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,679
[Mumbling]

210
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:56,158
- I'm sorry.
- [Groaning]

211
00:14:56,238 --> 00:14:59,078
Who that?
Who there?

212
00:15:01,718 --> 00:15:05,317
So that's what openin' up
a can of whoop-ass feels like.

213
00:15:05,357 --> 00:15:09,117
Son, you just opened
a whole case of whoop-ass.

214
00:15:09,157 --> 00:15:12,756
I would be honored if you
play football for this team.

215
00:15:12,836 --> 00:15:16,276
- Me? Play football?
- Yes.

216
00:15:16,356 --> 00:15:19,875
Thanks, but no thanks. My mama
won't let me play no football.

217
00:15:19,955 --> 00:15:23,595
We're gonna go home.
You and I, we're gonna talk to Mama.

218
00:15:23,635 --> 00:15:26,394
M-Mama said... M-Mama said...
My mama said... Mama said...

219
00:15:26,474 --> 00:15:30,034
- My mama said... My mama say that...
- She's gonna say yes.

220
00:15:33,553 --> 00:15:35,913
[Zapper Buzzing]

221
00:15:41,392 --> 00:15:44,232
Mmm, that snake
looks delicious.

222
00:15:44,272 --> 00:15:47,151
What part do you think
I'm about to eat?

223
00:15:47,191 --> 00:15:51,231
Uh, basically
a snake don't have parts.

224
00:15:51,271 --> 00:15:54,270
But, uh, if I had to
call it anything,

225
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:57,390
I would say
it's his knee.

226
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,029
Great. His knee.

227
00:16:01,909 --> 00:16:03,989
And what are we having
for dessert?

228
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:07,828
[Animal Chittering
In Zapper]

229
00:16:07,868 --> 00:16:09,268
- Squirrel.
- [Squirrel Thuds]

230
00:16:10,908 --> 00:16:12,788
Excellent.

231
00:16:14,747 --> 00:16:16,947
Let's talk about Bobby
playing football.

232
00:16:17,027 --> 00:16:19,946
I don't like it, Mr. Coach Klein.
I don't like it one bit.

233
00:16:20,026 --> 00:16:22,666
You see, my boy is too delicate
to be playin' "fool's ball"...

234
00:16:22,746 --> 00:16:24,746
or whatever you call it...
with them gargantuans.

235
00:16:24,826 --> 00:16:27,025
I don't think you understand,
Mrs. Boucher.

236
00:16:27,105 --> 00:16:29,465
No, you don't understand me,
Mr. Coach Klein.

237
00:16:29,545 --> 00:16:33,345
My boy is all I got left. Ow!

238
00:16:33,385 --> 00:16:35,424
- [Steve Braying]
- Mama, here.

239
00:16:35,504 --> 00:16:37,344
It's the brain pain, Coach.

240
00:16:37,424 --> 00:16:40,504
You see, my husband Robert,

241
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:44,143
one day back in 1966,
pick up sticks,

242
00:16:44,223 --> 00:16:47,743
and me four months pregnant
with this precious angel.

243
00:16:47,823 --> 00:16:50,222
He decides he wants to go
and help the foreign peoples.

244
00:16:50,262 --> 00:16:52,062
He's gonna go
and join the peace corps.

245
00:16:52,102 --> 00:16:54,262
And he promise me
that everything's gonna be okay.

246
00:16:54,302 --> 00:16:57,101
Just like you
promisin' me now.

247
00:16:57,181 --> 00:16:59,741
But everything wasn't okay. No.

248
00:16:59,821 --> 00:17:03,260
He got lost in the middle
of the Sahara Desert.

249
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:06,620
And he died.
He died!

250
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:12,059
- Couldn't get no water, Coach.
He died of the dehydration.
- And we were left all alone.

251
00:17:12,139 --> 00:17:16,258
I would've gotten my daddy some water,
but I was just a little baby
inside Mama's stomach.

252
00:17:16,338 --> 00:17:19,258
And now you wanna take away
the only part of my Robert I have left.

253
00:17:19,298 --> 00:17:23,417
But don't you want the only part you've
got left to get a college education?

254
00:17:23,457 --> 00:17:27,777
- Nah.
- Me, a college student?

255
00:17:27,857 --> 00:17:30,696
Yes. Bobby, think about it.

256
00:17:30,776 --> 00:17:32,856
A whole new world
will open to you.

257
00:17:32,896 --> 00:17:35,976
Boy, Mama, that-that-that sounds nice.
Me-Me, a college man.

258
00:17:36,016 --> 00:17:38,015
Coach, my Bobby's
a sweet boy,

259
00:17:38,095 --> 00:17:40,695
but he ain't exactly what you'd call
"college material,"

260
00:17:40,775 --> 00:17:43,535
so don't you go fillin' his simple head
with all those crazy dreams...

261
00:17:43,575 --> 00:17:46,414
of school and college
and things of that sort.

262
00:17:46,414 --> 00:17:48,854
But Mama, I-I'm tired
of everybody callin' me a dummy.

263
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:52,133
I'm-I'm tired
of not havin' any friends.

264
00:17:52,173 --> 00:17:55,253
And my ass is tired sittin' here
jawin' all night. I'm goin' to bed.

265
00:17:55,293 --> 00:17:59,252
Nice to meet you, Mr. Coach.
Good luck with your fool's ball.

266
00:17:59,332 --> 00:18:02,012
Bobby, after you let Mr. Coach out,
you come into my bedroom.

267
00:18:02,092 --> 00:18:04,412
Mama'll brush your hair.

268
00:18:07,131 --> 00:18:09,011
- [Door Closes]
- You know, when I was your age,

269
00:18:09,091 --> 00:18:13,330
my mother told me not to get a tattoo...
of Roy Orbison.

270
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:23,209
But what Mama don't know
won't hurt her.

271
00:18:26,368 --> 00:18:28,648
I trust you'll make
the right decision.

272
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:35,087
# Oh, yeah #

273
00:18:36,567 --> 00:18:38,447
# Huh
I'm #

274
00:18:38,527 --> 00:18:41,566
# Gonna get under your skin #

275
00:18:41,646 --> 00:18:44,646
- # Sooner or later #
- Damn, I don't want that ass
on the team.

276
00:18:44,726 --> 00:18:46,566
Everybody's gonna
laugh at us.

277
00:18:46,646 --> 00:18:48,565
Everybody's already
laughin' at us.

278
00:18:48,645 --> 00:18:51,325
We ain't won a game
since 1994.

279
00:18:51,405 --> 00:18:55,724
- # Sooner or later ##
- Hey! What's up, baby?
- Hey.

280
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:59,804
- Where's your helmet?
- Derek Wallace, they-they
don't got no more helmets.

281
00:18:59,884 --> 00:19:02,683
Here. You can share mine.

282
00:19:02,763 --> 00:19:05,083
Try it on, man.
See if it fits.

283
00:19:08,042 --> 00:19:10,762
- All right.
- Thanks, friend.

284
00:19:10,842 --> 00:19:14,042
- What a dink.
- [Whistle Blowing]

- [Mumbling]
- [Coach Klein] All right,
we have an announcement to make.

00:19:19,521 --> 00:19:23,400

is gonna play some linebacker for us.

[lmitating Bobby]
Ooh, I'm a f-f-football player.
[Grunting]

289
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,599
- Coach, I'd like to tackle him
right now, please.
- Not yet.

290
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:35,998
All right, now I wanna work with the
offense. I wanna work with the defense.

291
00:19:36,078 --> 00:19:38,998
- Special teams, go with
Farmer Fran, do some laps.
- Shit.

292
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:41,398
[Farmer Fran Mumbling]

293
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:46,957
Line up on the ball.

294
00:19:48,517 --> 00:19:51,276
- [Man] Let's go.
- All right? Third and ten.

295
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,396
Third and ten?

296
00:19:55,356 --> 00:19:58,955
Yeah, you know, that's
the offense's last opportunity...

297
00:19:59,035 --> 00:20:00,875
to gain ten yards
before they have to punt.

298
00:20:00,955 --> 00:20:02,835
Gee, he's gonna run
the option.

299
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,754
Option?

300
00:20:04,794 --> 00:20:07,474
- [Grumbling]
- He ain't never gonna be able
to figure this out, Coach.

301
00:20:07,554 --> 00:20:10,354
Yes, he is.

302
00:20:10,434 --> 00:20:13,953
Now, Bobby, you've waterboyed
for 18 years.

303
00:20:14,033 --> 00:20:15,953
Didn't you occasionally
watch the game?

304
00:20:15,993 --> 00:20:18,792
Oh, I had a lot
to k-keep me busy.

305
00:20:18,832 --> 00:20:22,352
- Checking the pH levels,
refillin' the cups.
- All right.

306
00:20:22,432 --> 00:20:24,432
Well, then let's just
keep it simple.

307
00:20:24,512 --> 00:20:27,671
Casey. I want you
to tackle Casey...

308
00:20:27,751 --> 00:20:30,191
like you did Gee yesterday.

309
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:33,110
- Right now?
- Right now! Go!

- Does he know about this?
- Doesn't matter. You're a warrior.

311

Go.

- [Man] Boy, what you doin'?
- [Players Grumbling]

313

[Coach Klein]
All right. Bobby, Bobby.

00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,988
Don't be afraid to use
all of your strength, you know?

315
00:20:52,068 --> 00:20:54,347
He's resilient.
He's a resilient guy.

316
00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:56,267
Okay? Come on.

317
00:20:56,347 --> 00:20:59,587
[Man] Hey, Casey,
I think he wanna make out with you.

318
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:01,506
- [Whistle Blowing]
- Okay, that's enough. Thank you.

319
00:21:01,586 --> 00:21:05,666
Is there any sport that you
do watch? You know, a physical sport?

320
00:21:05,746 --> 00:21:07,865
- Boxing? Hockey?
- Wrestling.

321
00:21:07,945 --> 00:21:10,105
Wrestling! Wrestling is good.

322
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:12,025
Who's your favorite wrestler?

323
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:15,264
Well, even though he was slightly
discourteous to me recently,

324
00:21:15,304 --> 00:21:17,304
I'm gonna have to say
Captain Insano.

325
00:21:17,384 --> 00:21:20,903
Okay, okay,
I want you to do to Casey...

326
00:21:20,943 --> 00:21:25,143
what Captain Insano does
to the bad guy.

327
00:21:25,223 --> 00:21:27,063
Go.

328
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:33,382
- Ow! Ow!
- [Players Gasping]

329
00:21:35,021 --> 00:21:38,461
- He poked me in the eye.
- Captain Insano shows no mercy.

330
00:21:39,861 --> 00:21:43,340
Bobby, where was the intensity
that I saw yesterday?

331
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,100
That was no intensity. You said it
was all right to fight back,

332
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:50,019
and I-I just started thinkin'
about all the people who-who'd
been mean to me over the years.

333
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,699
That's it.
That's it.

334
00:21:53,739 --> 00:21:55,978
I want you to think about
all those mean people.

335
00:21:56,058 --> 00:22:00,578
- They're gonna be your tackling fuel.
- Tacklin' fuel.

336
00:22:00,658 --> 00:22:04,417
- We're gonna use them to play football.
- Tacklin' fuel.

337
00:22:04,497 --> 00:22:08,497
I want you to pretend
that Casey...

338
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,816
- is insulting you.
- Pretend?

339
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:14,856
I want you to visualize all those
people that have been mean to you.

340
00:22:14,936 --> 00:22:17,615
And then I want you to attack. I want
you to visualize and then attack.

341
00:22:17,695 --> 00:22:20,175
- Can you handle that?
- I'll try.

342
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:22,095
He's gonna try.

343
00:22:31,373 --> 00:22:34,213
What's the matter with you, boy?
You too s-s-stupid...

344
00:22:34,293 --> 00:22:36,293
to do what your coach
tells ya?

345
00:22:36,413 --> 00:22:39,492
- [Coach Laughing]
- No!

346
00:22:39,532 --> 00:22:42,332
- No what?
- [Yelling]

347
00:22:45,011 --> 00:22:46,851
[Players Murmuring]

348
00:22:46,931 --> 00:22:50,611
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Coach told me to pretend.

349
00:22:50,651 --> 00:22:55,650
Bobby. Bobby! Can you do this for
me every single game? Can you do this?

350
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:57,930
Coach, not only
will I do it for you.

351
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:01,649
l-l-l...
Yes, yes, I'll do it for ya.

352
00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:05,009
[Chattering]

353
00:23:06,448 --> 00:23:09,488
So, uh, why you pick this class anyway?
It's pretty hard.

354
00:23:09,528 --> 00:23:11,728
Oh, beautiful view.

355
00:23:13,487 --> 00:23:15,327
Correct.

356
00:23:15,407 --> 00:23:18,527
All right, all right!

357
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:20,446
Y'all shut up now!

358
00:23:20,526 --> 00:23:24,606
Now, last week,
we talked about...

359
00:23:24,686 --> 00:23:26,765
the physiology
of the animal brain...

360
00:23:26,845 --> 00:23:29,725
as it pertains
to aggression.

361
00:23:29,805 --> 00:23:33,205
Now is there anyone here
that can tell me why...

362
00:23:33,285 --> 00:23:36,284
most alligators
are abnormally aggressive?

363
00:23:36,364 --> 00:23:39,404
- I know the answer to this question.
- Raise your hand.

364
00:23:39,444 --> 00:23:43,283
Anybody? Anyone?
Yes, sir. You, sir.

365
00:23:45,963 --> 00:23:48,162
Mama says that alligators
are ornery...

366
00:23:48,242 --> 00:23:50,962
'cause they got all them teeth
but no toothbrush.

367
00:23:53,122 --> 00:23:56,121
[Chuckling]
Yo mama said,

368
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:59,721
alligators are ornery
'cause they got all them teeth...

369
00:23:59,801 --> 00:24:01,800
and no toothbrush.

370
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,760
Wow!

371
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,640
Anybody else?
Yes, sir. You, sir.

372
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,199
Alligators are aggressive because
of an enlarged medulla oblongata.

373
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:12,159
It's the sector of the brain
which controls aggressive behavior.

374
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:16,118
- That is correct!
The medulla oblongata.
- But Mama said...

375
00:24:16,198 --> 00:24:18,958
The medulla oblongata...

376
00:24:20,278 --> 00:24:24,837
is where anger, jealousy
and aggression come from.

377
00:24:24,917 --> 00:24:29,677
Now, is there anybody here can tell
me where happiness comes from?

378
00:24:29,756 --> 00:24:32,756
- No, man.
- Anyone?

379
00:24:34,436 --> 00:24:38,915
All right, let's hear what
Mama has to say on the subject.

380
00:24:38,995 --> 00:24:44,434
Mama say that happiness is
from magic rays of sunshine that
come down when you feelin' blue.

381
00:24:46,514 --> 00:24:50,634
Well, folks,
Mama's wrong again.

382
00:24:51,793 --> 00:24:53,673
No, Colonel Sanders,
you're wrong.

383
00:24:53,713 --> 00:24:55,313
- [Students] Ooh!
- Mama's right.

384
00:24:55,393 --> 00:25:00,032
You're all wrong.
Mama's right. Mama's right!

385
00:25:00,072 --> 00:25:02,392
Somethin' wrong
with his medulla oblongata.

386
00:25:02,432 --> 00:25:05,391
- [Class Laughing]
- [Yelling]

387
00:25:09,351 --> 00:25:12,390
It's okay to fight back.
Coach Klein said I could.

388
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,630
Mr. Coach Klein said I could.
It's fine, fellas.

389
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:19,029
[Announcer] Well, Mud Dog
fans, it's time to kick off...

390
00:25:19,109 --> 00:25:20,989
another year
of Mud Dog football.

391
00:25:21,069 --> 00:25:24,909
With the weight of a 40-game
losing streak on their back,

392
00:25:24,989 --> 00:25:28,228
everyone seems to be diggin' in
for the long haul.

393
00:25:29,908 --> 00:25:32,827
# There's blood in the streets
It's up to my ankles #

394
00:25:34,347 --> 00:25:36,867
# There's blood in the streets
It's up to my knee #

395
00:25:38,307 --> 00:25:41,386
# Blood on the streets
in the town of Chicago #

396
00:25:41,466 --> 00:25:45,586
# Blood on the rise
It's following me ##

397
00:25:45,626 --> 00:25:47,505
What you doin', Bobby?

398
00:25:47,585 --> 00:25:51,025
Oh, Lord, that-that-that's some
heavy-duty armpit saturation.

399
00:25:51,105 --> 00:25:53,984
That's an early warning sign of
the dehydration. You gots to have H2O.

400
00:25:54,064 --> 00:25:55,704
- Please, for me.
- Look, you need to stop
worryin' about water, baby,

401
00:25:55,784 --> 00:25:57,984
and start worryin'
about the game today, okay?

402
00:25:58,064 --> 00:26:02,703
Here. Now, just do whatever you did
to Colonel Sanders,

403
00:26:02,743 --> 00:26:04,623
and you'll be fine.

404
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:08,742
I-I will, thank you. I-I-I just...
I feel bad about lyin' to my mama.

405
00:26:08,822 --> 00:26:10,822
I wonder what
she's doin' right now.

406

408
00:26:15,661 --> 00:26:19,301
- [Grunting]
- [Announcer] And he's down
with a three-yard kickoff return.

409
00:26:19,381 --> 00:26:21,661
- The Mud Dogs offense takes the field.
- Okay, come on, here we go.

410
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,980
Come on, everybody.
You can do it. Gain some yards.
Put some points on the board.

411
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,140
Hey, Walter,
I'll bet you 50 bucks...

412
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,739
Gee Grenouille throws a touchdown pass
on the first play.

413
00:26:29,819 --> 00:26:31,659
Check it out.

00:26:42,098 --> 00:26:43,937
You owe me 50 bucks.

418
00:26:44,017 --> 00:26:48,217
- You said it was gonna be
a touchdown pass, you crazy asshole.
- Go, go, go, go!

419
00:26:48,297 --> 00:26:51,616
Hold 'em, hold 'em, hold 'em.
Okay, you can do it. Come on.

420
00:26:51,696 --> 00:26:54,056
Bobby, Bobby, this is
just like we practiced, okay?

421
00:26:54,136 --> 00:26:55,976
Okay, go, go, go.

Hey, Waterboy, you're fired!

Waterboy's killin' 'em.

445
00:28:34,641 --> 00:28:37,921
He's the best tackler
I've seen since Joe Montana.

446
00:28:38,001 --> 00:28:40,961
Joe Montana was a quarterback,
you idiot.

447
00:28:41,001 --> 00:28:43,000
I said, "Joe Mantegna."

Number 62 is headed for the end zone.

He's almost...

Waterboy, you stink!

465
00:29:42,192 --> 00:29:45,831
Nice job, shithead.
You just lost us the game.

I'm sorry. Would you please
still be my friend?

No! Get away from me.

Vicki Vallencourt, this is...
this is quite a pleasant surprise.

Yeah, well, I just got out of jail,

So, let's say we go and get
somethin' to eat, catch up on things.

478
00:30:29,785 --> 00:30:31,665
Oh, uh...

479
00:30:31,745 --> 00:30:34,784
Mama's not a-a-a big fan
of restaurants...

480
00:30:34,864 --> 00:30:36,904
or of-of me going to one.

481
00:30:39,024 --> 00:30:41,583
But if-if you'd like,
sometimes,

482
00:30:41,623 --> 00:30:44,703
Mama, she, uh... she like to...
on a Sunday afternoon...

483
00:30:44,783 --> 00:30:49,262
There-There's a-a-a grill
with the charcoal b-biscuits.

484
00:30:49,342 --> 00:30:51,662
- You want me to come to a barbecue?
- Yes, that's it.

485
00:30:51,742 --> 00:30:54,342
[Chuckling]
Sounds great.

486
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:59,581
And by the way, I hope you like

00:31:12,739 --> 00:31:14,579
she really ought
to pack it in.

490
00:31:14,659 --> 00:31:17,658
Listen what she said
for Sagittarius. She goes:

491
00:31:17,698 --> 00:31:20,258
"You're gonna be faced with
a difficult decision today."

492
00:31:20,338 --> 00:31:23,657
But the thing is-is-is, we're all faced
with difficult decisions every day.

493
00:31:23,697 --> 00:31:25,777
- That's like sayin'
you're gonna eat today.
- Yeah, m-maybe...

494
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:29,017
by leaving her predictions
vague and generalized,

495
00:31:29,097 --> 00:31:31,816
there's less of a chance of someone
findin' out she's a phony.

496
00:31:31,896 --> 00:31:34,296
Whatever, college boy.

497
00:31:34,376 --> 00:31:37,695
- Don't say college boy. Here comes Mama.
- Oh, okay.

498
00:31:40,495 --> 00:31:43,015
That looks nice, Mama.

499
00:31:43,095 --> 00:31:44,934
[Sighing]

500
00:31:45,014 --> 00:31:47,934
- Mmm, here you go, Vicki Vallencourt.
- Thank you.

501
00:31:48,014 --> 00:31:51,013
Mama, Vicki's
an astrologist.

502
00:31:51,093 --> 00:31:53,213
I don't believe in that sort
of thing, personally.

503
00:31:53,293 --> 00:31:55,493
Astronomy is one
of the many tools of the devil.

504
00:31:59,012 --> 00:32:01,892
You sure played great
yesterday, Bobby.

505
00:32:01,972 --> 00:32:05,691
- What did my boy play great?
- Uh, um...

506
00:32:05,771 --> 00:32:10,011
Waterboy. Yeah, waterboy.
He played... He played waterboy great.

507
00:32:10,091 --> 00:32:13,410
Everybody who was thirsty
got a drink right away...

508
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:15,970
yesterday at the...
at the football game.

509
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:19,529
Fool's ball! Bunch of overgrown
monsters manhandling each other.

510
00:32:19,609 --> 00:32:22,009
Remember when that man wanted you
to play fool's ball, Bobby?

511
00:32:22,089 --> 00:32:25,808
Yeah, l... He...
Roy Orbison...

512
00:32:25,888 --> 00:32:28,568
Coach Klein.
I-I-I remember.

513
00:32:28,648 --> 00:32:30,568
So, Bobby, did they ever catch
that gorilla...

514
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:33,087
what escaped from the zoo
and punched you in the eye?

515
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:37,367
No, Mama, he...
The-The search continues.

516
00:32:40,446 --> 00:32:44,846
What would you think if Bobby
did play football, Mrs. Boucher?

517
00:32:44,926 --> 00:32:47,525
Well, I wouldn't
think much of it at all.

518
00:32:47,605 --> 00:32:50,165
And to tell you the truth,
I don't think much of you...

519
00:32:50,245 --> 00:32:53,365
and all your snotty questions,
Miss Vallencourt.

520
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:56,524
I'm quite disturbed to see
that you're so interested in my boy.

521
00:32:56,604 --> 00:33:00,563
I'm very, very interested
in your boy, Mrs. Boucher.

522
00:33:00,643 --> 00:33:02,243
- Really?
- Mm.

523
00:33:02,243 --> 00:33:04,603
Well, did he tell you
about how much his feet smell?

524
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:07,243
- Mama.
- He has to wear two pair of socks.

525
00:33:07,323 --> 00:33:10,362
Well, men are supposed
to have stinky feet.

526
00:33:10,442 --> 00:33:12,442
Well, are men
supposed to wear pajamas...

527
00:33:12,522 --> 00:33:15,081
featuring a cartoon character
by the name of Deputy Dog?

528
00:33:15,161 --> 00:33:17,881
- Mama, please.
- Well, you know what?

529
00:33:17,921 --> 00:33:20,241
I happen to find
Deputy Dog to be...

530
00:33:20,321 --> 00:33:24,400
very, very sexy.

531
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,080
Did he tell you about
a little bedtime problem?

532
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,959
- Mama, I'm beggin' you, don't.
- That's his sheet back there.

533
00:33:32,239 --> 00:33:35,439
If you'll excuse me, ladies,
I'm gonna go hang myself.

534
00:33:35,518 --> 00:33:38,318
- Now you see what you done?
- What I did?

535
00:33:38,358 --> 00:33:41,518
Now you listen here, cupcake. The
"onliest" woman in my boy's life is me.

536
00:33:41,598 --> 00:33:45,557
Nobody's gonna take him away, especially
not some godless Jezebel like you.

537
00:33:45,637 --> 00:33:47,797
Oh, yeah, well your Bobby
is a grown man.

538
00:33:47,837 --> 00:33:51,396
And guess what? He can hang out
with whoever he wants!

539
00:33:51,476 --> 00:33:53,756
Oh, yes, he can.
Whoever he wants. 'Cept you!

540
00:33:53,836 --> 00:33:57,315
Bobby, that-that woman
is the devil.

541
00:33:57,395 --> 00:33:59,435
- I want you to stay away
from her, you hear me?
- Yes, Mama.

542
00:33:59,515 --> 00:34:02,795
Now you come on inside before that
little ol' witch casts a spell on us!

543
00:34:06,554 --> 00:34:08,994
I'm sorry,
Vicki Vallencourt.

544
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,433
Whatever.

545
00:34:15,513 --> 00:34:19,152
# If you want it, you got it
You feed it, you love it #

546
00:34:19,232 --> 00:34:22,472
# Say that you need it
You never... ##

547
00:34:24,671 --> 00:34:28,391
When we report on the S.C.L.S.U.
Mud Dogs here on Sportscenter,
it's usually to add...

548
00:34:28,471 --> 00:34:32,030
another number to their amazing
losing streak, which now stands at 41.

549
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:35,390
But now, Bobby Boucher
has given us another reason.

550
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:37,390
In the Mud Dog's latest loss
this past Saturday,

551
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:40,349
the amazing 31-year-old freshman
set a new N.C.A.A. record...

552
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:42,829
by sacking the quarterback
16 times,

553
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:45,109
shattering the old record
of seven.

554
00:34:45,189 --> 00:34:48,348
And, oh, by the way, Bobby Boucher
is also the team's waterboy,

555
00:34:48,388 --> 00:34:50,548
which, of course,
begs the question:

556
00:34:50,628 --> 00:34:52,707
What exactly are they putting
in the water...

557
00:34:52,747 --> 00:34:55,547
down in Jackson's Bayou,
Louisiana?

558
00:34:55,627 --> 00:35:00,346
# There is a house
in New Orleans #

559
00:35:02,026 --> 00:35:05,866
# They call The Rising Sun ##

560
00:35:05,986 --> 00:35:09,025
[Announcer] We're deadlocked
at three with less than a minute to go.

561
00:35:09,105 --> 00:35:11,505
[Coach Klein]
We are one family with one dream.

562
00:35:11,585 --> 00:35:13,504
There are 40 of you
on this team, not just one.

563
00:35:13,584 --> 00:35:17,144
Bobby can't do this by himself. Now get
out there and make something happen!

564
00:35:17,224 --> 00:35:19,544
- All right, sacrifice
your bodies. Go, go, go!
- [Players Cheering]

565
00:35:19,624 --> 00:35:23,743
Thank you. Bobby, you're gonna
have to do this by yourself...

566
00:35:23,823 --> 00:35:26,063
because there is nobody
on this team that's any good.

567
00:35:26,143 --> 00:35:28,822
Now look, I can't stand
losing anymore.

568
00:35:28,902 --> 00:35:31,742
We've got to win one game. Can you
go out there and make something happen?

569
00:35:31,822 --> 00:35:33,502
- Visualize and attack.
- Yeah.

570
00:35:33,542 --> 00:35:35,021
- Visualize and attack. Please!
- Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

571
00:35:35,101 --> 00:35:37,741
- Please!
- [Mumbling, Indistinct]

572
00:35:37,781 --> 00:35:41,021
[Announcer] Central Kentucky's down
to their third straight quarterback.

573
00:35:41,061 --> 00:35:43,460
Good news, folks.
First-string quarterback, Tommy Gardner,

574
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,460
does not have a broken neck.

575
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:49,019
Blue, 52!
Blue, 52! Hut!

576
00:35:49,099 --> 00:35:52,019
I forbid you to talk to
that enchantress. She's the devil!

577
00:35:52,099 --> 00:35:55,858
She's not the devil. She's the
most beautiful woman in the world.

578
00:35:55,898 --> 00:35:59,458
- I never said she was the devil.
- She's the most beautiful woman
in the world.

579
00:35:59,538 --> 00:36:01,458
Oh, please, don't hurt me!

580
00:36:03,457 --> 00:36:06,297
Follow the...
Come on!

581
00:36:06,377 --> 00:36:08,257
You crazy man!
Okay, okay, okay!

582
00:36:08,337 --> 00:36:11,856
It's a safety!
They win, they win, they win!

583
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:15,016
With the help of Boucher,
the losing streak is over!

584
00:36:15,056 --> 00:36:18,175
I'm so sorry, Mama.
Please, forgive me.

585
00:36:18,255 --> 00:36:21,415
I love you so much, Mama.
I love you.

586
00:36:21,575 --> 00:36:23,854
- I love you too.
- [Derek] We won!

587
00:36:23,894 --> 00:36:27,534
We won, baby! It's gonna be a big
party tonight, and you're going!

588
00:36:27,574 --> 00:36:30,813
- Me? Party?
- Yeah, baby!

589
00:36:30,853 --> 00:36:33,133
[Cheering]

590
00:36:33,173 --> 00:36:36,013
[Chanting]
Party! Party!

591
00:36:36,053 --> 00:36:39,332
# Let's groove tonight #

592
00:36:39,412 --> 00:36:43,292
# And share
the spots and light #

593
00:36:45,491 --> 00:36:48,131
Hey! Nice suit.

594
00:36:48,211 --> 00:36:50,491
Thank you.
It was my daddy's.

595
00:36:50,531 --> 00:36:55,770
Mama don't know I'm here,
but I took these outta the icebox:
Louisiana frog cakes.

596
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,850
Thanks.

597
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:01,489
- Come on in.
- [Woman] Hey, Bobby Boucher!

598
00:37:01,569 --> 00:37:04,169
Look who's here:
Sergeant Stutter.

599
00:37:04,209 --> 00:37:07,848
- Want a beer?
- I'll take a Scotch and water.
Hold the Scotch.

600
00:37:07,888 --> 00:37:11,208
- You just make a joke, Bobby?
- Yes, I did.

601
00:37:11,288 --> 00:37:14,167
[Chuckling]
Good one.

602
00:37:14,247 --> 00:37:18,327
Now that you finally won a game, right,
you feel looser, the pressure is off,

603
00:37:18,407 --> 00:37:20,966
and that will lead
to a lot more victories.

604
00:37:21,046 --> 00:37:25,366
- Yeah, that and a waterboy
getting 20 sacks a game.
- That too.

605
00:37:27,205 --> 00:37:29,245
- Professor!
- [Gasping]

606
00:37:29,325 --> 00:37:32,045
We still havin' that test on amphibians
and reptiles next Friday?

607
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:36,844
Yes, sir. That is,
if it's all right with you.

608
00:37:36,924 --> 00:37:41,603
- Of course, it is.
- My best regards to your dear mama.

609
00:37:41,643 --> 00:37:44,363
[Woman]
Let's talk to the waterboy.

610
00:37:44,443 --> 00:37:46,563
You played amazing
at the game today, Bobby.

611
00:37:46,643 --> 00:37:50,482
And you are so cute.
Is there a girl you're seein'?

612
00:37:50,522 --> 00:37:55,361
Seein'? Uh, uh, I see
a lot of girls.

613
00:37:55,401 --> 00:37:57,601
I see a lot of guys too.

614
00:37:57,641 --> 00:38:00,041
I think that's sexy.

615
00:38:00,121 --> 00:38:02,560
You ever been with a guy and a girl
at the same time?

616
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,480
Oh, yeah, plenty of times.

617
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,920
The other night, I was with my mama
and Coach Klein at the same time.

618
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,359
You are a bad boy.
I wish you were my boyfriend.

619
00:38:13,439 --> 00:38:17,798
Oh, thank you, but, see, there's
this girl, Vicki Vallencourt.

620
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:19,878
She may be the devil.
Mama said that.

621
00:38:19,958 --> 00:38:22,917
Consequently, I am prohibited
from contact with her.

622
00:38:22,997 --> 00:38:27,197
But I hope to get past that
one day 'cause she's nice to talk to.

623
00:38:27,197 --> 00:38:31,596
[Mumbling, Indistinct]

624
00:38:34,316 --> 00:38:36,196
Oh, oh.

## [Rap]

Baby, let me play the clothes
and I'll take me off #

627
00:38:51,513 --> 00:38:53,473

00:38:53,553 --> 00:38:55,753
# And I'm much more than your waterboy

637
00:39:19,029 --> 00:39:21,189
Yo, we have a very special
guest here today.

638
00:39:21,229 --> 00:39:25,828
Let's have a warm L.T. welcome
for Bobby Boucher. Come on, Bobby.

639
00:39:25,908 --> 00:39:28,108
- [Cheering]
- Thank you, Mr. Lawrence Taylor.

640
00:39:28,188 --> 00:39:31,788
Tell me, what is your secret?
How do you find yourself
in the right position all the time?

641
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:33,707
That-That-That's
a good question.

642
00:39:33,747 --> 00:39:37,547
What-What happens is, the-the-the
center has-has the ball first.

643
00:39:37,627 --> 00:39:39,626
And-And-And the quarterback
will say, "Hike."

644
00:39:39,706 --> 00:39:43,466
That's when the c-center puts the ball
in-into the hands of the quarterback.

645
00:39:43,546 --> 00:39:46,545
So what I do is,
I-I start tacklin' the quarterback,

646
00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:48,905
unless he give the ball
to-to s-somebody else,

647
00:39:48,985 --> 00:39:52,025
in which case,
I-I try to tackle that person.

648
00:39:53,744 --> 00:39:57,504
Hmm? Children, which brings me
to my next point:

649
00:39:57,584 --> 00:39:59,504
Don't smoke crack.

651
00:40:08,822 --> 00:40:13,062
Vicki Vallencourt.
What you doin' here?

652
00:40:13,142 --> 00:40:15,781
Oh, nothin'.
I was just thinkin'...

653
00:40:15,821 --> 00:40:19,221
about stealin' L.T.'s Porsche
over there.

654
00:40:19,301 --> 00:40:23,460
But I suppose I ought to
be movin' on before I get you
in trouble with your mama.

655
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:28,220
Well, Mr. Coach Klein said that
what Mama don't know won't hurt her.

656
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:32,939
So maybe we could
ride home together.

657
00:40:32,979 --> 00:40:36,658
- Really?
- If you'd like to.

658
00:40:36,738 --> 00:40:39,258
[Giggling]
Okay.

659
00:40:39,338 --> 00:40:42,417
[Man]
Who got the hooch?

660
00:40:44,257 --> 00:40:48,737
# Who got the hooch
Baby #

661
00:40:48,817 --> 00:40:53,656
# Who got the only
sweetest thing in the world #

[Braying Continues]

669
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:24,172
Vicki Vallencourt,
I figured...

670
00:41:24,252 --> 00:41:27,931
'cause you're interested in astrology
and mystical stuff like that,

671
00:41:28,011 --> 00:41:30,371
you might appreciate this.

672
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:35,330
That's water
from a glacier in Alaska.

673
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:39,769
It-lt was blessed
by a-an Eskimo medicine man.

674
00:41:39,849 --> 00:41:45,328
- It's cold!
- Yes, it's always cold.
That's why it's so special.

675
00:42:00,446 --> 00:42:03,406
That-That was...
That-That-That-That happened...

676
00:42:03,486 --> 00:42:07,565
That-That happened to be
my-my first time with-with lips...

677
00:42:07,645 --> 00:42:11,405
and-and-and-and-and
and-and-and-and-and the-the tongue.

678
00:42:11,485 --> 00:42:15,084
That was your tongue.
l... I believe it was...

679
00:42:15,164 --> 00:42:17,244
I never did that before.

680
00:42:17,324 --> 00:42:19,164
Well, if that was
your first kiss,

681
00:42:19,244 --> 00:42:23,083
then I bet it's the first time
you've seen a pair of these.

682
00:42:25,323 --> 00:42:28,922
Yes, yes, that is
a-another first for me,

683
00:42:29,002 --> 00:42:33,082
and I-I appreciate what-what-what
you're showin' me right now.

684
00:42:33,162 --> 00:42:35,801
[Snoring Continues]

685
00:42:35,881 --> 00:42:38,961
Vicki-Vicki Vallencourt,
I-I think Mama's up.

686
00:42:41,081 --> 00:42:44,360
[Mumbling]
Devil, devil, devil.

687
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,040
You better get goin'.

688
00:42:48,759 --> 00:42:52,919
My God, Bobby, I mean, sometimes,
I just don't know why I bother with you.

689
00:42:52,999 --> 00:42:55,239
You ain't even a man.

690
00:42:58,518 --> 00:43:02,078
[Announcer] It looks like
the Cinderella S.C.L.S.U. Mud Dogs,

691
00:43:02,118 --> 00:43:04,317
led by linebacker
Bobby Boucher,

692
00:43:04,397 --> 00:43:07,957
are gonna fall one victory short
of that Bourbon Bowl bid.

693
00:43:08,037 --> 00:43:11,156
Iowa could win the game
by nailing this 20-yard field goal.

694
00:43:11,196 --> 00:43:13,836
Yeah, but the Mud Dogs have played
a sensational football game.

695
00:43:13,916 --> 00:43:15,636
Let's take a look at the way Boucher
entered the Hawkeyes' last drive.

696
00:43:15,636 --> 00:43:18,355
Let's take a look at the way Boucher
entered the Hawkeyes' last drive.

697
00:43:18,435 --> 00:43:21,715
Here we see Boucher
instantly penetratin' the pocket.

698
00:43:21,795 --> 00:43:23,834
[Grunting]

699
00:43:23,914 --> 00:43:27,274
There's a lot of pain
and shame in those eyes.

700
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:29,034
Friends, it's all over.

701
00:43:29,074 --> 00:43:32,473
- [Man] My leg!
- Wow, that is a disturbing image.

702
00:43:32,553 --> 00:43:34,873
Difficult to watch, Chris.
[Exhales]

703
00:43:34,953 --> 00:43:37,632
Whoo! My God!

704
00:43:37,712 --> 00:43:41,872
Gonna kick some names
and take some ass!

705
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,311
Bobby!

706
00:43:44,391 --> 00:43:47,591
Water sucks.
Gatorade is better.

707
00:43:47,631 --> 00:43:50,391
- What?
- Use it on the field.

708
00:43:50,471 --> 00:43:53,070
[Crowd Chanting]
Waterboy, Waterboy, Waterboy!

709
00:44:00,349 --> 00:44:04,949
Gatorade not only quenches your thirst
better, it tastes better too, idiot.

710
00:44:04,989 --> 00:44:07,948
You're-You're-You're drinkin'
the wrong water.

711
00:44:08,028 --> 00:44:11,788
- Gatorade.
- H2O.

712
00:44:11,868 --> 00:44:16,147
- Gatorade!
- H2O!

713
00:44:16,187 --> 00:44:20,426
# Water sucks, It really, really sucks
Water sucks #

714
00:44:20,506 --> 00:44:23,826
- # It really, really sucks ##
- Stop saying that. You don't
mean that. You're bad people.

[Bobby Whimpering]

716
00:44:41,743 --> 00:44:44,303
- [Cheering]
- [Announcer] And my friend, Chris,

717
00:44:44,343 --> 00:44:47,262
the Mud Dogs are goin'
to the Bourbon Bowl.

718
00:44:49,542 --> 00:44:52,502
With yesterday's come-from-behind
victory, the S.C.L.S.U. Mud Dogs...

719
00:44:52,582 --> 00:44:55,301
earned a New Year's Day date with Red
Beaulieu and the Louisiana Cougars...

720
00:44:55,381 --> 00:44:57,261
in the first annual
Bourbon Bowl.

721
00:44:57,341 --> 00:45:00,541
But not only has the waterboy
changed S.C.L.S.U.'s fortunes,

722
00:45:00,621 --> 00:45:03,020
he's got other teams looking
around the sidelines for talent.

723
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,380
In fact, yesterday, Michigan,
devastated by injury,

724
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:08,939
experimented with their towel boy
at wide receiver.

725
00:45:09,019 --> 00:45:13,619
- [Groaning]
- But the towel boy ran into
a laundry list of problems.

726
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:17,458
[Cheering]

727
00:45:34,616 --> 00:45:37,575
You know, when I see
so many of you here tonight,

728
00:45:37,655 --> 00:45:42,655
it reminds me just about how special
this season really was.

729
00:45:42,735 --> 00:45:44,854
Not just for the team.

730
00:45:44,894 --> 00:45:47,254
Not just for the students.

731
00:45:47,334 --> 00:45:50,134
But for each and every
one of you...

732
00:45:50,174 --> 00:45:53,813
in our small corner
of Louisiana!

733
00:45:53,853 --> 00:45:57,612
- [Cheering]
- You can do it!

734
00:45:57,612 --> 00:46:01,652
Oh, yes, we can,
and, yes, we will.

735
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:03,492
Because we've got...

736
00:46:03,572 --> 00:46:07,851
a young man who has been
so vital to our success.

737
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:10,771
A wonderful student-athlete.

738
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:15,290
And a wonderful friend.

739
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:18,209

00:46:34,087 --> 00:46:36,127
Thank you so much...

743
00:46:36,207 --> 00:46:38,127
for bein' my friends.

744
00:46:38,207 --> 00:46:42,206
- [Crowd Cheering]
- You can do it!

745
00:46:42,286 --> 00:46:45,566
I'd also like to take
this opportunity...

746
00:46:45,646 --> 00:46:48,525
to tell you that my mama
don't know how I play football,

747
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:53,165
so if-if you could not tell
my mama I-I play football,
that would be for the best.

[Horn Honking]

751
00:47:11,002 --> 00:47:15,561
We must be a little lost. We're tryin'
to get to the Bourbon Bowl.

752
00:47:15,641 --> 00:47:18,681
Looks like we ended up
in Retardville, U.S.A.

753
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,720
Hey, Waterboy, you fixin'
to tackle all of us?

754
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:31,159
- Kick his water-lovin' ass, Greg.
- I asked you a question, dumb ass.

755
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:36,598
You even exhale,
and I will saw your head off.

756
00:47:36,638 --> 00:47:39,718
You can do it!
Cut his fucking head off!

757
00:47:41,438 --> 00:47:44,917
Hold it, hold it. Just a minute.
Now what is the problem here, honey?

758
00:47:44,997 --> 00:47:48,317
I mean, whatever it is,
we don't want this to get physical.

759
00:47:48,397 --> 00:47:50,276
Right, Klein?

760
00:47:50,316 --> 00:47:52,876
[Vicki] Yeah, well, your team actin'
like a bunch of shitheads.

761
00:47:52,956 --> 00:47:58,115
This is not how ambassadors
for the University of Louisiana
are supposed to act.

762
00:47:58,195 --> 00:48:02,675
So now you just get back on the bus.
[Chuckling]

763
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:06,914
However,
assault with a deadly weapon,

764
00:48:06,994 --> 00:48:09,354
very, very serious offense.

765
00:48:09,434 --> 00:48:13,553
Officer, get her
little country ass outta here.

766
00:48:13,633 --> 00:48:16,353
- [Crowd Murmuring]
- Thank you, Vicki.

767
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:19,032
Let's go.

768
00:48:19,112 --> 00:48:23,792
Ah! It's the waterboy!

769
00:48:23,872 --> 00:48:25,711
I got something for you.

770
00:48:25,791 --> 00:48:30,351
This is his transcript from
South Lafayette High School...

771
00:48:30,431 --> 00:48:32,550
in Cherokee Plains,
Louisiana.

772
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:34,950
Now the problem with that...

773
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:39,869
is there ain't no South Lafayette High
School in Cherokee Plains, Louisiana.

774
00:48:39,909 --> 00:48:44,029
- So obviously, this is a fake!
- [Crowd Gasping]

775
00:48:44,109 --> 00:48:47,988
However, this is not a fake.

776
00:48:48,028 --> 00:48:50,628
This is from the N.C.A.A.

777
00:48:50,708 --> 00:48:53,147
They don't think you ought
to play football no more.

778
00:48:54,667 --> 00:48:57,227
So allow me to say this to you
one more time:

779
00:48:57,307 --> 00:48:59,146
You're fired.

780
00:48:59,226 --> 00:49:02,106
Oh, no!
We suck again!

781
00:49:02,186 --> 00:49:05,586
Ever see a championship ring?

782
00:49:05,666 --> 00:49:08,985
- Don't be messin' with the champ.
Come on, Laski.
- You didn't go to high school?

783
00:49:09,065 --> 00:49:12,265
I was home schooled.
I-I didn't know I needed...

784
00:49:12,345 --> 00:49:16,544
- Forged a fake transcript.
- No, no, I-I-I didn't.

785
00:49:16,624 --> 00:49:19,224
- The waterboy's a cheater.
Cut his head off.
- [Crowd Agreeing]

786
00:49:19,304 --> 00:49:22,983
Listen, everybody!
This don't change nothin'!

787
00:49:23,063 --> 00:49:26,143
We played as a team,
we won as a team.

788
00:49:26,223 --> 00:49:28,302
And just because
the waterboy's a cheater,

789
00:49:28,302 --> 00:49:31,062
don't change the fact
that the real Mud Dogs...

790
00:49:31,142 --> 00:49:33,502
are gonna kick
some Cougar ass.

791
00:49:33,582 --> 00:49:35,821
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!

792
00:49:35,861 --> 00:49:40,381
[Together] Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!

793
00:49:40,461 --> 00:49:44,260
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!

794
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:48,020
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!

795
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:49,979
- That's the way!
- [Cheering]

796
00:49:56,378 --> 00:49:58,738
Sorry, Bobby.

797
00:50:00,738 --> 00:50:05,257
# Oh, what a lonely boy #

798
00:50:05,337 --> 00:50:08,737
Believe me,
I-I understand.

799
00:50:08,817 --> 00:50:11,256
Yeah, and you're
deeply appreciated, Mr. Dodd.

800
00:50:11,336 --> 00:50:14,696
Thank you so much.
Bye-bye.

801
00:50:14,776 --> 00:50:16,935
Good news, Bobby.

802
00:50:17,015 --> 00:50:20,335
- The N.C.A.A. is gonna allow you
to play in the Bourbon Bowl.
- Yes.

803
00:50:20,415 --> 00:50:22,575
You just have to pass the high school
equivalency test.

804
00:50:22,615 --> 00:50:25,814
It's not the test, Coach.

805
00:50:25,894 --> 00:50:29,094
Everybody hates me.

806
00:50:29,134 --> 00:50:32,613
That's not true.

807
00:50:32,693 --> 00:50:35,733
One man said he wanted
to decapitate me.

808
00:50:35,813 --> 00:50:39,492
Nobody else thought that
to be too bad of an idea.

809
00:50:42,252 --> 00:50:44,491
Somebody made me
look like a-a-a cheater.

810
00:50:44,531 --> 00:50:47,971
I did it. I did it. I did it!
I did it! I did it!

811
00:50:48,051 --> 00:50:51,770
- It was me.
- Why?

812
00:50:55,170 --> 00:51:00,009
Because I wanted you to play.
Because you were my way out, Bobby.

813
00:51:00,089 --> 00:51:03,089
'Cause it was the only way
to get you in.

814
00:51:03,169 --> 00:51:05,688
I am so sorry.

815
00:51:05,728 --> 00:51:08,448
Why didn't you s-stick up for me
down by the river?

816
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:15,127
The truth is, I fled.

817
00:51:15,207 --> 00:51:17,807
I came into my office,
I went under my desk, I cried.

818
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:21,166
I cried. I cried
like a ten-year-old girl!

819

[Groaning]

820
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:30,045
Red and I have a history.

821
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:32,205
Twenty years ago,
we were assistants to Coach Cavanaugh...

822
00:51:32,285 --> 00:51:35,604
at the University
of Louisiana.

823
00:51:35,684 --> 00:51:39,084
Red ran the practices,
and I used to come up with the plays.

824
00:51:40,403 --> 00:51:42,443
Oh, boy, was I good.

825
00:51:44,123 --> 00:51:48,722
I would write these foolproof plays
in my little green notebook that I had.

826
00:51:48,762 --> 00:51:51,762
- The opposition
didn't even know what hit 'em.
- [Door Knocking]

827
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:53,682
And when Coach Cavanaugh
was going to retire,

828
00:51:53,762 --> 00:51:57,121
me and Red, we just knew that one of us
was gonna be his successor.

829

00:52:00,281 --> 00:52:02,640
- Hey, Red.
- How ya doin'?

831
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,600
Come by to wish me luck?

832
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:12,079
Well, not exactly, no, no.
Actually, I come by to get you
to do ol' Red a little favor.

833
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:14,199
Sure. What's up?

834
00:52:14,279 --> 00:52:18,118
Well, you know that green
notebook you use to write
all them football plays in?

835
00:52:18,198 --> 00:52:22,317
Well, I need to show Cavanaugh that
I can come up with some good play ideas.

836
00:52:22,357 --> 00:52:25,197
But you didn't come up
with them.

837
00:52:25,277 --> 00:52:28,437
They're my plays.
I need them.

838
00:52:28,517 --> 00:52:33,836
Klein, I'm gonna have
this book one way or another,

839
00:52:33,916 --> 00:52:36,715
so you might as well let the damn
thing go, 'cause if you don't,

840
00:52:36,795 --> 00:52:39,475
it's gonna get awfully,
awfully physical around here.

841
00:52:39,515 --> 00:52:42,995
And I don't think
you want that, do you? Huh?

842
00:52:44,354 --> 00:52:46,674
[Cackling]

843
00:52:46,754 --> 00:52:50,873
Of course, Red got the job.
Next day, fired me.

844
00:52:50,913 --> 00:52:53,033
Once he had my notebook,
he didn't need me anymore.

845
00:52:55,273 --> 00:52:57,152
I didn't take it very well.

846
00:52:57,192 --> 00:53:00,712
No, Grandma,
I didn't get it.

847
00:53:00,792 --> 00:53:03,032
I can't believe it myself.

848
00:53:03,112 --> 00:53:07,711
I know.
I'm so numb.

849
00:53:07,791 --> 00:53:10,231
I just hate him,
I hate him, I hate him.

850
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:14,430
That is a terrible story, Coach.

851
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:17,750
- But why-why don't you just
come up with some new plays?
- I tried.

852
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:19,629
- I can't.
- Yes.

853
00:53:19,669 --> 00:53:24,749
I guess I have a mental block,
you know, ever since Red took
my playbook and my manhood.

854
00:53:24,829 --> 00:53:28,268
I knew what he was gonna do!

855
00:53:28,348 --> 00:53:31,148
And I just didn't fight back.

856
00:53:31,228 --> 00:53:34,867
Well, you're gonna show him
that you're a man on Saturday.

857
00:53:36,627 --> 00:53:38,507
And I'm gonna show everybody
that I'm not a dummy.

858
00:53:38,547 --> 00:53:41,666
I'm gonna go study.

859
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:50,505
Mama, maybe you could stop brushin'
my hair so I can read.

860
00:53:50,545 --> 00:53:52,665
Read?

861
00:53:52,745 --> 00:53:55,704
You don't have to read.

862
00:53:57,744 --> 00:54:01,303
- What you readin' for?
- 'Cause I enjoys it, Mama.

863
00:54:01,343 --> 00:54:04,743
Don't look like to me you enjoys it,
sittin' there all grouchy.

so, so I can go to school.

with nobody to keep me company,
except Steve?

to roost, Bobby Boucher.

You reap the fruit
of your selfish ways.

874
00:54:45,497 --> 00:54:47,617
You're gonna lose all your
fancy fool's ball games...

875
00:54:47,657 --> 00:54:50,696
and you're gonna fail your big exam,
because school is...

and I like football!

00:54:59,695 --> 00:55:03,094
And I'm gonna keep doin' them both
because they make me feel good!

880
00:55:04,494 --> 00:55:07,094
And by the way, Mama,
alligators are ornery...

881

882

972
01:01:42,357 --> 01:01:46,077
Well, wake her ass up!
We gotta win tomorrow!

01:02:00,395 --> 01:02:03,074
[Woman On P.A.,
Indistinct]

974
01:02:06,914 --> 01:02:11,153
Mama! Thank God, you're okay.
I'm so sorry.

975
01:02:11,193 --> 01:02:13,553
I was so bad, Mama.
You were right about everything.

976
01:02:13,633 --> 01:02:15,793
- I've been a real knucklehead.
- Oh, hush, baby.

977
01:02:15,873 --> 01:02:19,112
You should've seen this
a long time ago.

978
01:02:19,192 --> 01:02:21,032
Oh, my word!

979
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:23,712
- Is that my daddy?
- No, no.

980
01:02:23,792 --> 01:02:26,791
That's a guy I dated
before I met your father.

981
01:02:26,871 --> 01:02:29,511
Oh, you could iron
a shirt on his stomach.

982
01:02:29,591 --> 01:02:33,110
Well, that was lust, not love.
Turn the page.

983
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:38,309
There's your daddy.

984
01:02:38,389 --> 01:02:40,709
- So handsome.
- Oh.

985
01:02:40,789 --> 01:02:42,629
Read on.

986
01:02:44,749 --> 01:02:47,148
"Dear Helen."
Who's Helen?

987
01:02:49,108 --> 01:02:50,988
That's my first name, Bobby.

988
01:02:51,068 --> 01:02:53,587
Ohh!

989
01:02:55,227 --> 01:02:57,467
"I have arrived here
in New Orleans.

than in the picture books.

"I'm sure I'll have
no problem finding work,

"so you can expect my next letter
to contain lots of money.

01:03:07,305 --> 01:03:09,265
Your loving husband, Robert."

994
01:03:09,345 --> 01:03:11,185
That's nice, Mama.

995
01:03:11,265 --> 01:03:15,424
"Dear Helen."
That's you.

1006

Ciao, Roberto."

1007
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:52,779
He changed his name
to Roberto.

1008
01:03:52,859 --> 01:03:55,418
I guess he thought
it was more exotic.

1009
01:03:55,458 --> 01:03:58,298
But Mama says that...
I mean, you say that...

1010
01:03:58,378 --> 01:04:02,497
Bobby, your daddy didn't
go into no Peace Corps.

1011
01:04:04,137 --> 01:04:06,097
He deserted us, baby.

1012
01:04:07,937 --> 01:04:09,776
No, no, Mama.
You-You...

1013
01:04:09,856 --> 01:04:12,456
You shouldn't be dredgin' up these
painful memories in your condition.

Oh, hush. Your mama's
as healthy as an ox,

1015

and as dumb as one to boot.

1016
01:04:17,775 --> 01:04:20,135
I was so scared
you'd abandon me too.

1017
01:04:20,215 --> 01:04:25,294
And I made you abandon
all those people who depend on ya.

1018
01:04:25,374 --> 01:04:28,054
I hid you away from the world,
Bobby Boucher.

But I can't hog you
to myself no more,

because everyone's seen
how wonderful you are.

01:04:36,013 --> 01:04:39,292
- Oh, Mama!
- Now.

You go play fool's ball
with your friends.

1023
01:04:45,771 --> 01:04:48,611
[Man] Welcome to ABC's coverage
of the Bourbon Bowl.

1024
01:04:48,691 --> 01:04:51,970
Good afternoon, everybody.
I'm Brent Musburger,
along with my colleague, Dan Fouts.

1025
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:55,650
And the big story here, Dan, is a game
that's lost some of its luster...

1026
01:04:55,730 --> 01:04:59,289
without its star player,
the waterboy Bobby Boucher.

1027
01:04:59,369 --> 01:05:02,009
You know, Red's got a couple
of solid early rounders out there.

1028
01:05:02,089 --> 01:05:05,608
I know, but I really wanted to scout
that waterboy. Reminds me of Greg Lloyd.

1029
01:05:05,688 --> 01:05:08,008
- Naw. "Hack" Thomas.
- Whatever.

1030
01:05:08,048 --> 01:05:09,928
- Is she ready?
- [Clattering]

1031
01:05:09,968 --> 01:05:12,647
Oh, yeah.
She's more than ready.

1032
01:05:12,687 --> 01:05:16,567
Come on, Bobby!
You'll miss the boat!

1033
01:05:20,206 --> 01:05:22,086
Let's go, ladies.

[Musburger]
We are underway!

1036
01:05:29,485 --> 01:05:31,925
The opening kickoff
is a beauty!

1037
01:05:34,804 --> 01:05:37,444
Holdsworth is gonna bring it out
from nine yards deep.

1038
01:05:37,524 --> 01:05:39,084
- Come on.
- [Grunting]

1039
01:05:39,124 --> 01:05:41,283
- Yeah!
- [Grunting, Groaning]

1040
01:05:41,363 --> 01:05:45,683
Dan, they're showing no respect
for this team without Boucher.

1041
01:05:45,763 --> 01:05:48,922
[Fouts] Good reason, Brent.
109 yards untouched.

1042
01:05:49,002 --> 01:05:51,562
- [Cheering]
- Touchdown, Cougars! They strike first.

1043
01:05:53,202 --> 01:05:55,521
[Yelling, Shouting]

1044
01:05:58,321 --> 01:06:00,321
- [Whistle Blowing]
- Time running down in the first quarter.

1045
01:06:00,401 --> 01:06:02,600
Cougars lead is 17-0.

1046
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,320
Set!

1047
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,239
Three! Thirty-three!

1048
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:11,839
- [Growling]
- Three! Thirty-three! Hut!

1049
01:06:13,959 --> 01:06:16,318
Dan, that quarterback can't even
get the ball off before he's hit.

1050
01:06:16,358 --> 01:06:18,518
It's as if they're in
the offensive huddle with him.

1051
01:06:18,598 --> 01:06:22,317
- [Laughing]
- [Muttering]

1052
01:06:22,397 --> 01:06:24,677
Are you gonna finish
that hot dog, Jimmy?

1053
01:06:24,757 --> 01:06:26,957
Ugh! Now I'm not.

1054
01:06:27,037 --> 01:06:29,916
[Bobby] Mama, you think
we'll make it on time?

1055
01:06:29,956 --> 01:06:33,716
Hang on! I'll show you what
A.J. Foyt taught me.

1056
01:06:37,555 --> 01:06:40,235
[Musburger] That's the end of
the half. The Cougars are dominating.

1057
01:06:40,275 --> 01:06:44,034
Let's hope the Mud Dogs
can make some adjustments.

1058
01:06:44,114 --> 01:06:45,954
- Well, they better, 'cause they suck.
- Mm-hmm.

1059
01:06:51,633 --> 01:06:53,793
Anybody got an idea?

1060
01:06:57,752 --> 01:06:59,592
Hey.

1061
01:07:01,312 --> 01:07:05,351
- Remember the time Bobby tackled
the referee by mistake?
- [Chuckling]

1062
01:07:05,431 --> 01:07:07,711
Yeah, that was pretty funny.

1063
01:07:07,791 --> 01:07:10,111
How about the time he tackled
the guy from Louisville...

1064
01:07:10,191 --> 01:07:12,870
- and threw him into the stands?
- [All Laughing]

1065
01:07:14,550 --> 01:07:19,149
Y'all remember when he intercepted
the ball and his pants fell off?

1066
01:07:19,229 --> 01:07:22,429
And then he ran for
the touchdown, bare-assed.

1067
01:07:24,429 --> 01:07:28,548
Remember the time Bobby...
[Mumbling Incoherently]

1068
01:07:33,987 --> 01:07:37,587
Remember when Bobby Boucher
showed up at halftime and the
Mud Dogs won the Bourbon Bowl?

1069
01:07:37,667 --> 01:07:40,226
[Cheering, Shouting]

1070
01:07:43,946 --> 01:07:48,385
Hey, sorry about givin' you
so much shit this year.

1071
01:07:48,465 --> 01:07:50,625
You're the heart and soul
of this team, Bobby.

1072
01:07:50,665 --> 01:07:53,304
Ain't one of us could've
passed that test.

1073
01:07:53,384 --> 01:07:57,064
Thank you all so much
for being my friends.

1074
01:07:57,064 --> 01:08:00,423
Well, let's wait till later
to hold hands and kiss.
We got a Bowl game to win.

1075
01:08:00,503 --> 01:08:02,223
- Right?
- [All Together] Yeah!

1076
01:08:02,263 --> 01:08:04,583
- Two, three!
- [All] Mud Dogs! Woof!

1077
01:08:04,663 --> 01:08:07,462
[Musburger]
In a dramatic turn of events,

1078
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:10,502
Bobby Boucher
just arrived at halftime.

1079
01:08:10,582 --> 01:08:14,821
And on a fan boat, Brent. His mother
drove him right into the stadium.

1080
01:08:19,061 --> 01:08:23,340
[Players Shouting,
Hooting]

1081
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:26,180
[Crowd Chanting]
Waterboy! Waterboy!

1082
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:29,459
Waterboy! Waterboy!

1083
01:08:29,539 --> 01:08:32,339
Waterboy! Waterboy!

1084
01:08:32,379 --> 01:08:35,018
Fool's ball's
not for the devil.

1085
01:08:35,058 --> 01:08:36,938
It's for my Bobby.

1086
01:08:37,018 --> 01:08:40,978
Time to open up
some whoop-ass.

1087
01:08:42,937 --> 01:08:46,697
[Cheering, Chanting
Continues]

1088
01:08:46,777 --> 01:08:50,456
Shit, he showed up.
All right, look.

1089
01:08:50,536 --> 01:08:54,696
Just relax. Relax. Go in there and
do exactly like we planned. Go, go, go!

1090
01:08:54,736 --> 01:08:57,535
This could be the start
of some high drama, folks.

1091
01:08:57,615 --> 01:08:59,775
Or are the Mud Dogs
too far behind?

1092
01:08:59,815 --> 01:09:02,335
Bobby Boucher
is on defense.

1093
01:09:02,415 --> 01:09:05,734
- The Cougars are coming out
from their own 20 yard line.
- [Quarterback] Hut! Hut!

1094
01:09:05,814 --> 01:09:08,294
The pitch.
It's a reverse!

1095
01:09:08,374 --> 01:09:10,813
Boucher's not fooled.

1096
01:09:10,893 --> 01:09:13,613
Fumble!
Robideaux's got it!

1097
01:09:13,653 --> 01:09:15,333
Touchdown, Mud Dogs!

1098
01:09:15,413 --> 01:09:17,292
[Growling]

1099
01:09:17,372 --> 01:09:20,932
- Boy, Boucher knocked
the poop out of him.
- "Poop"?

1100
01:09:21,012 --> 01:09:24,051
[All Shouting]

1101
01:09:24,091 --> 01:09:25,971
Slap hands!
Slap hands!

1102
01:09:27,691 --> 01:09:31,730
Drink up, now. I want you girls to
sober up. Have faith in my Bobby.

1103
01:09:31,770 --> 01:09:34,810
[Musburger] The Mud Dogs are
faced with yet another third and long.

1104
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:36,890
- Hut!
- Grenouille back to pass.

1105
01:09:36,970 --> 01:09:42,049
He's gonna be stuffed again!
And the Mud Dogs offense is
still unable to move that ball.

1106
01:09:42,129 --> 01:09:45,248
But the way their defense
is fired up, they still have
a shot at winning this game.

1107
01:09:45,328 --> 01:09:47,368
Blake, come here. Look.

1108
01:09:47,448 --> 01:09:50,768
Now, what if we, uh...
[Whispering]

1109
01:09:52,887 --> 01:09:56,087
Trust me. Go, go, go, go, go.
[Evil Laughter]

1110
01:09:56,167 --> 01:10:00,486
[Musburger] The Cougars lead 27-7 in
the middle of the third quarter.

1111
01:10:00,566 --> 01:10:02,526
- And he takes a knee?
- [Whistle Blows]

1112
01:10:02,606 --> 01:10:06,285
- Y'all gonna play or what?
- [Chattering]

1113
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:09,525
[Laughing]
How do you all like my new offense?

1114
01:10:12,365 --> 01:10:14,244
[Musburger]
All right, it's second and 12...

1115
01:10:14,284 --> 01:10:17,844
- as the Cougars line up on the ball.
- Hut! Hut!

1116
01:10:17,884 --> 01:10:19,963
[Whistle Blows]

1117
01:10:20,083 --> 01:10:23,123
What is Red Beaulieu doing,
refusing to play offense?

1118
01:10:23,123 --> 01:10:25,843
- Dan, this is bizarre.
- [Dan] No, it's not, Brent.

1119
01:10:25,923 --> 01:10:29,122
It's brilliant, because Red is
taking the waterboy out of the game.

1120
01:10:29,202 --> 01:10:31,642
By kneeling down
three times and punting,

1121
01:10:31,722 --> 01:10:33,681
he's gonna make the Mud Dog
offense try to beat him.

1122
01:10:33,761 --> 01:10:36,081
And the way they're playing
today, that's impossible.

1123
01:10:36,161 --> 01:10:38,121
[Musburger] Well, the Mud Dog's
most valuable player,

1124
01:10:38,201 --> 01:10:41,280
the linebacker they call "the Waterboy,"
is now powerless.

1125
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:46,360
That means Coach Klein will have
to find another way to outfox Red.

1126
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:50,639
- [Whistle Blows]
- [Man] Mud Dogs call a time-out.

1127
01:10:50,759 --> 01:10:53,319
- [Cheering, Indistinct]
- Mr. Coach Klein. Mr. Coach Klein!

1128
01:10:53,399 --> 01:10:55,998
Mr. Coach Klein!

1129
01:10:56,078 --> 01:11:00,158
- Where are you going?
- I was just gonna get a hot pretzel.

1130
01:11:00,198 --> 01:11:02,957
Mr. Coach Klein, are you afraid
of Red Beaulieu?

1131
01:11:03,037 --> 01:11:05,557
[Laughing, Shouting]

1132
01:11:06,597 --> 01:11:08,477
I am petrified of him.

1133
01:11:08,517 --> 01:11:11,516
Well, why don't you pretend
that Red Beaulieu...

1134
01:11:11,596 --> 01:11:13,676
is somebody that
you're-you're not afraid of.

1135
01:11:13,716 --> 01:11:16,355
- Pretend?
- Yes.

1136
01:11:16,435 --> 01:11:18,955
Visualize somebody
you're not afraid of.

1137
01:11:19,035 --> 01:11:22,075
- And then attack, like you told me.
- I'll try.

1138
01:11:22,115 --> 01:11:24,954
Well, he's right over there.

1139
01:11:29,873 --> 01:11:32,633
[Chuckling]

1140
01:11:35,873 --> 01:11:37,992
Little baby.

1141
01:11:38,032 --> 01:11:40,472
Yeah.

1142
01:11:40,512 --> 01:11:45,271
Hello, little baby.
[Baby Talking]

1143
01:11:47,751 --> 01:11:50,551
A poo-poo?
Do you have a poo-poo?

1144
01:11:50,630 --> 01:11:52,470
Yes.

1145
01:11:52,510 --> 01:11:54,910
Okay. Now.

1146
01:11:54,950 --> 01:11:57,310
This is what we're gonna do.
He's gonna come here...

1147
01:11:57,350 --> 01:11:59,749
[Chattering, Shouting]

1148
01:12:05,068 --> 01:12:08,068
Come and get
this one, Cougars.

1149
01:12:08,148 --> 01:12:10,468
Red, 22! Hike!

1150
01:12:10,548 --> 01:12:13,467
[Musburger]
Snap to Grenouille. A reverse!

1151
01:12:13,507 --> 01:12:17,147
No, it's a double reverse!
Oh, what a block!

1152
01:12:17,187 --> 01:12:19,026
And Boudier springs free!

1153
01:12:19,106 --> 01:12:23,706
Trouble! Lateral!
Got him! What a play!

1154
01:12:23,746 --> 01:12:27,385
Grenouille to the 15!
To the 10! To the 5!

1155
01:12:27,465 --> 01:12:29,705
- Touchdown, Mud Dogs!
- [Fouts] Well, well, well.

1156
01:12:29,785 --> 01:12:32,345
I guess Coach Klein does have
a few tricks up his sleeve after all.

1157
01:12:32,385 --> 01:12:35,824
What the hell...
What the hell is this? Huh?

1158
01:12:35,904 --> 01:12:39,184
We go from a championship
football team to a bunch of dogs!

1159
01:12:39,264 --> 01:12:42,583
Right now, we're going to go down to
the sidelines and our man, Lynn Swann.

1160
01:12:42,663 --> 01:12:44,743
Swannie, what do
you have for us?

1161
01:12:44,823 --> 01:12:46,662
I'm with Vicki Vallencourt,
who's taking over...

1162
01:12:46,742 --> 01:12:49,622
Bobby Boucher's water duties
for this important game.

1163
01:12:49,702 --> 01:12:52,622
Oh, I'm not takin' over.
I'm just tryin' not to screw up too bad.

1164
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:55,941
Well, let me ask you this.
What's your prediction for
the rest of this ball game?

1165
01:12:55,981 --> 01:12:57,981
Mud Dogs are gonna win,
30 to 27.

1166
01:12:58,061 --> 01:13:00,660
That's very interesting.
How'd you come up with that guess?

1167
01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:04,060
Guess? That ain't no guess!
That's what it's gonna be.

1168
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:07,020
- Okay. That's fine.
- Oh! Be careful down there, Swannie.

1169
01:13:10,299 --> 01:13:12,859
All right.
Meaney. Where's Meaney?

1170
01:13:12,939 --> 01:13:14,778
- Meaney?
- Here, Coach.

1171
01:13:14,858 --> 01:13:18,258
- Get in there and let's see if
that waterboy can stop you.
- Yes, sir!

1172
01:13:18,338 --> 01:13:22,457
Red is sending his best defender in
as a running back?

1173
01:13:22,537 --> 01:13:24,937
What do you make of this, Dan?

1174
01:13:25,017 --> 01:13:27,217
Well, Brent, he's gotta find
some way to neutralize the waterboy.

1175
01:13:27,297 --> 01:13:30,576
He probably thinks that Meaney
will just pound it in there like
Fridge used to do for the Bears.

1176
01:13:30,656 --> 01:13:34,176
Hey, Waterboy! Is your girlfriend
gonna save you again?

1177
01:13:34,256 --> 01:13:36,375
Oh, no, sir. I'm gonna take matters
into my own hands.

1178
01:13:36,455 --> 01:13:40,375
- You'll see.
- Bridge the hole!
Your ass is mine! Whoo!

1179
01:13:40,455 --> 01:13:43,214
Whoo! Whoo!

1180
01:13:43,294 --> 01:13:45,334
You sound like a...
a big choo-choo train.

1181
01:13:45,414 --> 01:13:48,774
Whoo!

# Fight, fight, fight
with your might ##

1184
01:14:04,691 --> 01:14:07,451
All right, field goal.
Field goal. Go.

1185
01:14:07,531 --> 01:14:10,770
- Derek. Derek!
- Yeah.

1186
01:14:10,810 --> 01:14:13,890
Visualize the attack.
Go kick the ball. Kick it.

1187
01:14:13,970 --> 01:14:15,730
- Hut!
- [All Grunting]

1188
01:14:17,210 --> 01:14:19,249
How you doin', boy?

[Players Shouting,

1193
01:14:45,006 --> 01:14:47,205
What the hell is that?

1194
01:14:52,964 --> 01:14:56,444
Where the hell is... What the hell
is he up to? That ain't in here! Huh?

1195
01:14:56,524 --> 01:14:58,284
- [Cheering]
- Hey!

1196
01:14:58,364 --> 01:15:00,323
[Musburger]
Down by ten late in the fourth quarter,

1197
01:15:00,363 --> 01:15:02,883
Coach Klein
opts for the field goal.

1198
01:15:02,963 --> 01:15:06,443
[Fouts]
Then they have to hope for the onside
kick and a touchdown to tie the game.

1199
01:15:06,522 --> 01:15:10,602
Dan, look what we have here.
Boucher's in the game as a blocker.

1200
01:15:10,642 --> 01:15:12,922
Last game of the year, Brent.
Can't hold anything back now.

1201
01:15:15,441 --> 01:15:17,881
Set!

1202
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:22,600
The snap. It's a fake!

1203
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,319
Boucher's out in front!
A great block!

1204
01:15:29,359 --> 01:15:32,599
- [Grunting]
- And a second one!

1205
01:15:32,639 --> 01:15:35,038
Touchdown, Mud Dogs!

1206
01:15:35,118 --> 01:15:38,558
- Boucher led him all the way!
- [Screaming] Yeah!

1207
01:15:40,798 --> 01:15:42,677
Red Beaulieu
is steaming, Dan.

1208
01:15:42,757 --> 01:15:45,077
Brent, he sees his
perfect season slipping away.

1209
01:15:45,157 --> 01:15:48,596
The Cougar's lead
is down to three.

1210
01:15:48,676 --> 01:15:52,996
[Cheerleaders Cheering,
Indistinct]

1211
01:15:53,076 --> 01:15:56,275
The Mud Dogs need the ball back if
they're gonna have a shot at overtime.

1212
01:15:56,355 --> 01:15:59,795
And Bobby Boucher is
now on the kickoff team.

1213
01:15:59,875 --> 01:16:03,394
- Last game of the year, Brent.
Can't hold anything back now.
- I know.

1214
01:16:03,474 --> 01:16:06,754
- [Horns Blaring]
- Who's it gonna be?

1215
01:16:06,794 --> 01:16:10,273
Who's it gonna be?
Who's it gonna be?

1216
01:16:13,433 --> 01:16:16,393
[Chuckling]
Oh, yeah. There's my bitch.

1217
01:16:16,472 --> 01:16:18,912
[Musburger] Remember,
the ball must travel ten yards.

1218
01:16:21,312 --> 01:16:23,312
It's loose!

1219
01:16:23,392 --> 01:16:26,351
- Mud Dogs football! Mud Dogs football!
- All right!

1220
01:16:26,431 --> 01:16:28,431
Mama, I got the football!
I got it...

1221
01:16:28,511 --> 01:16:31,070
Oh, what a vicious hit!
That was a cheap shot.

1222
01:16:31,150 --> 01:16:32,910
- Oh!
- [Murmuring]

1223
01:16:32,990 --> 01:16:35,390
- [Whistle Blowing]
- [Fouts] And what a dumb penalty.

1224
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:38,629
That puts the Mud Dogs
in field goal range for the tie.

1225
01:16:38,709 --> 01:16:42,109
- Dan, I'm not sure that Boucher
is able to get back up.
- Oh, my baby!

1226
01:16:48,828 --> 01:16:50,908
It's still cold.

1227
01:16:50,948 --> 01:16:53,867
- [Chattering]
- Excuse me. Out of my way.

1228
01:16:57,147 --> 01:16:59,706
Dan, you hate
to see this happen.

1229
01:17:07,745 --> 01:17:10,625
Now, that's
high quality H2O.

1230
01:17:10,705 --> 01:17:14,584
- [Cheering]
- [Vicki] Come on, now!
Make it happen, Bobby!

1231
01:17:18,504 --> 01:17:20,663
The waterboy
just needed some water.

1232
01:17:20,703 --> 01:17:25,143
- Wow, Dan. You think that up
all by yourself?
- Shut up, Brent.

1233
01:17:28,262 --> 01:17:29,942
- [Shouting, Yelling]
- Are you okay?

1234
01:17:30,022 --> 01:17:32,102
He tried to open up a can
of whoop-ass on me. I wouldn't let him.

1235
01:17:32,182 --> 01:17:35,821
Listen, I have an idea for the last
play. You haven't done this before.

1236
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:37,741
All right? The offense
is gonna line up like this.

1237
01:17:37,821 --> 01:17:39,661
- Yeah.
- You're gonna be right here.

1238
01:17:39,741 --> 01:17:41,860
[Musburger]
There'll be no tie here today.

1239
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:45,460
Coach Klein is sending
his offense back on to the field.

1240
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:47,579
He's going for
the win right now.

1241
01:17:47,659 --> 01:17:49,459
[Fouts] Yeah, this is
a real gutsy call, Brent.

1242
01:17:49,539 --> 01:17:51,459
He'll either be a hero
or a goat because of this.

1243
01:17:51,539 --> 01:17:55,978
[Musburger] And Dan,
Bobby Boucher is back on the field.

1244
01:17:56,058 --> 01:17:59,858
He is now playing offense!
We know. We know.

1245
01:17:59,938 --> 01:18:03,137
Meaney, if they give
that Waterboy the football,

1246
01:18:03,217 --> 01:18:05,057
I don't care if you
have to stab him!

1247
01:18:05,137 --> 01:18:07,337
Do not let him get away.
Do you understand me?

1248
01:18:07,417 --> 01:18:11,016
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir!
- Do you understand me? Get in there!

- Let's do it, Bobby.

Forty-three! Set!
Forty-three! Hut, hut!

1253
01:19:44,723 --> 01:19:47,562
Touchdown! They win it!
The Mud Dogs win it!

1254
01:19:47,642 --> 01:19:51,722
Bobby Boucher's the hero! He's gone
from waterboy, Dan, to saviour!

1255
01:19:51,802 --> 01:19:53,921
And it's because he didn't
hold anything back!

1256
01:19:54,001 --> 01:19:57,401
Well, Swannie's down on the field
with our hero, so let's go to Lynn now!

1257
01:20:00,201 --> 01:20:04,040
We did it! I can't believe it!
I can't believe it!

- Vicki, I love you!
- Whoo! I love you too, baby.

this day for a long time.

You can do it!
You can do it all night long!

1274
01:21:10,670 --> 01:21:13,470
I'm gonna go do it!

- [Tires Screech]
- Bobby, it's me!

1276
01:21:21,629 --> 01:21:25,068
- Your daddy, Roberto.
- Daddy?

1277
01:21:25,148 --> 01:21:29,868
I've seen you on the ESPN
when they was talkin' about
you being drafted by the NFL.

1278
01:21:29,908 --> 01:21:33,507
Not going to the NFL.
I'm gonna stay in school and graduate.

1279
01:21:33,587 --> 01:21:37,307
The hell with school, dopey! Take the
money! You and me could be partners,

1280
01:21:37,347 --> 01:21:40,746
- just like that Tiger Woods
and his daddy.

what time it was #

1288
01:22:16,141 --> 01:22:21,540
# All I know is that
I fell in love with you #

1289
01:22:21,580 --> 01:22:24,380
# And if all my dreams
come true #

1290
01:22:24,460 --> 01:22:28,019
# I'll be spending time
with you #

1291
01:22:28,099 --> 01:22:30,779
# Every day's a new day #

1292
01:22:30,819 --> 01:22:33,819
# In love with you #

1293
01:22:33,899 --> 01:22:36,898
# With each day
comes a new way #

1294
01:22:36,978 --> 01:22:39,938
# Of loving you #

1295
01:22:40,018 --> 01:22:43,017
# Every time
I kiss your lips #

1296
01:22:43,097 --> 01:22:45,857
# My mind starts to wander #

1297
01:22:45,897 --> 01:22:48,576
# And if all my dreams
come true #

1298
01:22:48,656 --> 01:22:52,376
# I'll be spending time
with you #

1299
01:22:52,456 --> 01:22:56,655
# I love you more today
than yesterday #

1300
01:22:58,855 --> 01:23:03,854
# But not as much as tomorrow #

1301
01:23:03,934 --> 01:23:08,734
# Oh, I love you more today
than yesterday #

1302
01:23:10,053 --> 01:23:13,053
# But darling, not as much #

1303
01:23:13,093 --> 01:23:16,532
# As tomorrow #

1304
01:23:16,572 --> 01:23:21,052
# Tomorrow may see springtime
just a day away #

1305
01:23:21,132 --> 01:23:22,692
# Day away #

1306
01:23:22,772 --> 01:23:27,171
# Cupid, we don't need you now
Be on your way #

1307
01:23:27,251 --> 01:23:28,731
# On your way #

1308
01:23:28,811 --> 01:23:31,530
# Thank the Lord
for love like ours #

1309
01:23:31,610 --> 01:23:34,330
# That grows ever stronger #

1310
01:23:34,410 --> 01:23:36,930
