The Twilight Saga 3 : Eclipse
Transcribed By <i>SALMAN</i>

2
00:00:40,145 --> 00:00:41,491
Who's there?!

3
00:00:44,091 --> 00:00:45,509
Who's there?!

4
00:01:26,598 --> 00:01:28,665
What do you want?!

5
00:02:11,027 --> 00:02:13,642
<i>Some say
the world will end in fire.</i>

6
00:02:14,972 --> 00:02:16,924
<i>Some say in ice...</i>

7
00:02:17,835 --> 00:02:22,549
From what I've tasted of desire,
I hold with those who favor fire.

8
00:02:24,628 --> 00:02:27,477
But if I had to perish twice...

9
00:02:29,223 --> 00:02:31,860
I think I know enough of hate,

10
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,057
To say that,
for destruction,

11
00:02:34,057 --> 00:02:38,450
Ice,
is also great.

12
00:02:40,546 --> 00:02:42,207
And would suffice.

13
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:46,463
You know,
I've got an english final.

14
00:02:46,463 --> 00:02:48,522
I gotta focus.

15
00:03:02,954 --> 00:03:04,835
Marry me.

16
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:07,343
No.

17
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,563
Marry me.

18
00:03:21,852 --> 00:03:23,523
Change me.

19
00:03:29,093 --> 00:03:33,590
Okey I will if you marry me,
It's called a compromise.

20
00:03:38,332 --> 00:03:40,691
It's just called coercion.

21
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:42,489
It's not fair.

22
00:03:43,858 --> 00:03:46,028
Marriage is just...

23
00:03:46,028 --> 00:03:48,465
Is a piece of paper.

24
00:03:50,203 --> 00:03:53,455
Where I am from,
it's the way one says, "I love you".

25
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:58,564
Where I come from,
at my age...

26
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:03,026
It's the way one says,
"I just got knocked up".

27
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:10,570
So, you're worried about
what people will think.

28
00:04:11,911 --> 00:04:14,288
You know, it's two out of three
marriages end in divorce.

29
00:04:16,727 --> 00:04:19,539
Well, I think you'll find
the...

30
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:23,708
Vampire, human divorce rate
is a little lower.

31
00:04:28,843 --> 00:04:30,554
Just marry me.

32
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:36,341
I can't.

33
00:04:38,335 --> 00:04:40,349
I have to be back at four.

34
00:05:03,797 --> 00:05:06,290
Four o'clock on the dot.

35
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,963
That kid trying to brown nose me
now or something?

36
00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:14,002
He has a name.
And now he's too punctual for you?

37
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:23,187
Okey...

38
00:05:24,887 --> 00:05:27,879
You understand
why you're being punished, right?

39
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:31,781
- I know, I put you through hell.
- Yes, you did.

40
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:36,741
But I have other reasons,
for grounding you.

41
00:05:36,741 --> 00:05:38,777
Like...

42
00:05:42,288 --> 00:05:46,355
I just want you to get
some separation from him.

43
00:05:48,076 --> 00:05:50,361
Dad, there is nothing
you can say.

44
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:55,041
Edward is in my life.

45
00:05:57,186 --> 00:05:59,719
Yeah, I'm gathering that.

46
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:06,216
So, alright. How about this?
I'll make you a deal.

47
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:12,535
You're not grounded anymore,
if...

48
00:06:12,535 --> 00:06:13,981
You use your
new found freedom...

49
00:06:13,981 --> 00:06:16,194
to see some
of your other friends too,

50
00:06:16,194 --> 00:06:20,142
Like...
Like Jacob.

51
00:06:20,142 --> 00:06:21,814
He's going through
a really tough time right now,

52
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,994
His Dad's
really worried about him.

53
00:06:24,521 --> 00:06:26,469
I remember
when that was you.

54
00:06:28,568 --> 00:06:32,115
You needed a friend,
Jake was there.

55
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,523
<i>Hey, it's Jake.
Leave a message.</i>

56
00:06:41,605 --> 00:06:43,505
Jacob hadn't talk to me
in weeks.

57
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,330
I wanted to fix it,
he just...

58
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,226
He wouldn't give me
the chance.

59
00:06:59,692 --> 00:07:03,817
<i>"I miss you too.
Doesn't change anything."</i>

60
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,359
You scared me.

61
00:07:46,103 --> 00:07:48,405
You're going now
to the reservation.

62
00:07:48,405 --> 00:07:51,987
How'd you -- ?
Alice...

63
00:07:55,321 --> 00:07:57,577
Hey,
did you do this to my truck?

64
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:01,902
Bella, you have to understand.
Your safety is everything to me.

65
00:08:01,902 --> 00:08:03,365
Jacob is not gonna hurt me!

66
00:08:03,365 --> 00:08:06,280
Not intentionally,
but the wolves have no control...

67
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,525
Edward!
I have...

68
00:08:09,525 --> 00:08:12,093
Until graduation,
to see him.

69
00:08:14,853 --> 00:08:19,100
And I'll be one of you,
and he'll hate me forever.

70
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,927
I'm sorry.

71
00:08:36,035 --> 00:08:37,857
- Hey.
- Just in time. Alright, check it out.

72
00:08:37,857 --> 00:08:40,257
- Alright, let's see what you got.
- My fellow students.

73
00:08:40,257 --> 00:08:41,089
- Cool.
- Right?

74
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:42,459
- Wow.
- Okey, right? -- Cute.

75
00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:45,334
We are the future.
Anything is possible...

76
00:08:45,334 --> 00:08:47,018
...If you just believe.
- Nice.

77
00:08:47,018 --> 00:08:48,676
Blah, blah, blah...

78
00:08:48,676 --> 00:08:50,556
- Perfect.
- And got your self a speech.

79
00:08:50,556 --> 00:08:51,675
No, this will be my speech.

80
00:08:51,675 --> 00:08:54,260
When I want everyone to throw
diplomas at my head.

81
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,755
So...
Thank you.

82
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,003
Ya gotta embrace the cliches,
Jess.

83
00:08:59,003 --> 00:09:01,513
They have the bread and butter
of all valedictorians.

84
00:09:01,513 --> 00:09:04,064
And that is why
you are not valedictorian.

85
00:09:04,064 --> 00:09:07,909
And Jess doesn't need cliches.
Speech is gonna be epic.

86
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:10,272
Epic? It'll change lives.

87
00:09:11,243 --> 00:09:13,008
I decided to throw a party.

88
00:09:13,008 --> 00:09:16,475
After all, how many times
we gonna graduate high school?

89
00:09:16,475 --> 00:09:18,323
A party? At your place?

90
00:09:19,966 --> 00:09:22,927
- I've never seen your house.
- No one's ever seen their house.

91
00:09:22,927 --> 00:09:24,895
A nother party, Alice?

92
00:09:24,895 --> 00:09:26,669
- It'll be fun.
- Yeah.

93
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:28,487
That's what you said last time.

94
00:09:33,292 --> 00:09:34,366
- Hey, Angela.
- Yes.

95
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:36,071
Do you need some help
with those?

96
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:08,177
I know you know what she saw.
Tell me.

97
00:10:08,177 --> 00:10:09,943
It was nothing.

98
00:10:10,895 --> 00:10:12,932
You looked worried.

99
00:10:14,132 --> 00:10:17,454
Just that everyone would notice
how strange Alice is.

100
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,563
I think that ship sailed
long ago.

101
00:10:23,746 --> 00:10:25,059
I wonder what's wrong.

102
00:10:25,572 --> 00:10:28,226
There's someone missing
in Seattle, over a year ago.

103
00:10:28,524 --> 00:10:30,950
Charlie is doing what he can,
but...

104
00:10:34,105 --> 00:10:35,832
Do you know something
about this?

105
00:10:38,981 --> 00:10:42,014
We've been tracking the situation
in Seattle for a while.

106
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:46,041
Unexplained disappearances,
killings...

107
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,138
If the situation gets anymore
conspicuous,

108
00:10:48,138 --> 00:10:50,086
the Volturi will step in.

109
00:10:52,258 --> 00:10:54,510
If they go to Seattle,
they can come here.

110
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:57,883
- They can see I'm still human.
- We won't get that far.

111
00:10:57,883 --> 00:11:00,108
But we'll go to Seattle
if we have to.

112
00:11:02,102 --> 00:11:03,611
I'll fax these down
the first thing.

113
00:11:03,611 --> 00:11:04,843
Thank you.

114
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,022
- Hey.
- Hey.

115
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,019
- You're ready for dinner?
- Yeah.

116
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:15,399
It is still just...
you and I, alright?

117
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:17,800
No, I'm just dropping her off.

118
00:11:19,235 --> 00:11:21,402
- See you later.
- Bye.

119
00:11:22,902 --> 00:11:24,991
Oh...
Bella.

120
00:11:24,991 --> 00:11:26,879
My parents wanted to
remind you about the...

121
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:28,903
Airline ticket
you got for your birthday.

122
00:11:28,903 --> 00:11:30,775
What airline ticket?

123
00:11:32,252 --> 00:11:34,898
A round trip ticket
to see Mom in Florida.

124
00:11:34,898 --> 00:11:37,203
Wow, that was generous.

125
00:11:37,203 --> 00:11:39,783
And it expires soon, they say
you might wanna use it this weekend.

126
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:43,407
Well, I can't just drop
everything and go.

127
00:11:43,407 --> 00:11:46,277
It might be your last chance
to see her before you graduate.

128
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:49,248
Well. It might not be
a bad idea.

129
00:11:49,248 --> 00:11:50,504
get out of the town
for a couple of days,

130
00:11:50,504 --> 00:11:52,783
get some distance.

131
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:57,119
Yeah,
I wouldn't mind seeing Mom...

132
00:11:57,119 --> 00:11:59,329
As long as you
use the companion ticket.

133
00:11:59,329 --> 00:12:01,812
Wait, just two tickets?

134
00:12:03,983 --> 00:12:07,928
Super,
That makes me really happy.

135
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,832
<i>I did wanna see my Mom.</i>

136
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:16,277
<i>I wanted to know that her life
was full by satisfying</i>

137
00:12:18,702 --> 00:12:20,239
Aren't you gonna miss this?

138
00:12:21,316 --> 00:12:25,480
Don't you just feel the vitamin D
soaking up in your pores?

139
00:12:28,427 --> 00:12:30,615
Yeah, I'm gonna miss this.

140
00:12:32,602 --> 00:12:35,635
You know, colleges in Florida
are a lot sunnier.

141
00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:42,639
I'm just saying,
if you go to university of Alaska...

142
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,255
I'm never gonna see you.

143
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:51,507
They have a really great
science program.

144
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,624
You mean Edward program.

145
00:12:57,025 --> 00:12:59,334
The way he watches you...

146
00:12:59,334 --> 00:13:00,865
It's like he's willing to leap
in front of you,

147
00:13:00,865 --> 00:13:02,934
and take a bullet
or something.

148
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:05,366
Is that a bad thing?

149
00:13:06,254 --> 00:13:08,766
It's an intense thing.

150
00:13:08,766 --> 00:13:10,482
You're different with him.

151
00:13:11,851 --> 00:13:15,455
If he moves, you move.
Like magnets.

152
00:13:16,966 --> 00:13:19,317
I don't know, we're  just...

153
00:13:19,317 --> 00:13:21,877
In love.
I get it.

154
00:13:22,823 --> 00:13:23,638
I just want to make sure,

155
00:13:23,638 --> 00:13:26,176
you're making
the right choices for you.

156
00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:29,905
You know, cause you're the one
who's gonna have to live with him.

157
00:13:33,721 --> 00:13:36,719
Alright, enough with the heavy.

158
00:13:43,563 --> 00:13:46,589
- Mom.
- Congraduation.

159
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:48,134
I didn't want you
to spending you're money.

160
00:13:48,134 --> 00:13:49,887
I didn't, come on.

161
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:07,238
Are these all our old trip T-shirts?
- Emm. -- Get out!

162
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,983
I saved'em all.
I thought they'd make a good quilt.

163
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:12,317
To keep you warm up in Alaska.

164
00:14:13,071 --> 00:14:16,150
Remember this one?
Ensanada.

165
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,850
- The snake pit.
- Yep.

166
00:14:18,798 --> 00:14:20,789
But this one is my favourite.
Here...

167
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:24,127
The three-headed lobster
in Maine.

168
00:14:24,127 --> 00:14:26,793
- This is amazing.
- No, honey. I'm glad you've like it.

169
00:14:26,793 --> 00:14:28,900
I just figured, you know,
when you get older, have kids,

170
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,352
We can add to it.
Maybe go visit...

171
00:14:30,352 --> 00:14:32,667
the world's largest catsup bottle
or something.

172
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,673
- Thanks
- Oh...

173
00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:38,333
I'm glad you like it.

174
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:42,826
I just thought, you should have
a little piece of me, up there in Alaska.

175
00:14:44,896 --> 00:14:47,217
- Mom.
- Yeah.

176
00:14:50,591 --> 00:14:55,858
- I miss you.
- Oh, honey. I miss you too.

177
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:15,248
You sure this is
where you saw her?

178
00:15:16,287 --> 00:15:18,266
She's almost here.

179
00:15:31,052 --> 00:15:32,315
On your left!

180
00:16:08,023 --> 00:16:11,165
Wait!
She's in their territory.

181
00:16:12,682 --> 00:16:14,355
She'll get away!

182
00:16:15,606 --> 00:16:17,130
No she won't!

183
00:16:52,755 --> 00:16:54,419
Emmett, no!

184
00:17:27,272 --> 00:17:28,879
Did you regret going?

185
00:17:30,739 --> 00:17:32,020
No.

186
00:17:33,338 --> 00:17:37,954
It was really great to see my mom.
Just really hard saying goodbye.

187
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:42,703
- It doesn't have to be goodbye.
- Is that why you ask me to go?

188
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,347
You thought
I was gonna change my mind.

189
00:17:46,792 --> 00:17:49,084
I'm always hoping for that.

190
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:51,981
What?

191
00:17:53,269 --> 00:17:56,203
If I asked you to stay in the car,
would you?

192
00:18:02,578 --> 00:18:04,059
Of course not.

193
00:18:16,322 --> 00:18:17,362
Hey.

194
00:18:18,822 --> 00:18:22,834
- Charlie said you left town.
- Yeah. To visit my Mom, why?

195
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,645
Just checking to see
if you're still human.

196
00:18:27,436 --> 00:18:28,940
I'm coming here to warn you.

197
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,204
If your kind
come on our land again...

198
00:18:32,204 --> 00:18:33,442
Wait, what?

199
00:18:36,065 --> 00:18:39,438
- You didn't tell her?
- Just leave it alone, Jacob.

200
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,846
Tell me what?

201
00:18:42,846 --> 00:18:46,160
Emmett and Paul
had a misunderstanding,

202
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,897
there is nothing
to worry about.

203
00:18:47,897 --> 00:18:49,703
Listen to you.

204
00:18:49,703 --> 00:18:51,771
Did you lie
to get her out of town, too?

205
00:18:51,771 --> 00:18:55,715
You should leave.
Now.

206
00:18:55,715 --> 00:18:57,799
She has a right to know.

207
00:18:58,492 --> 00:19:01,042
She is the one
the red-head wants.

208
00:19:02,326 --> 00:19:04,044
Victoria?

209
00:19:05,028 --> 00:19:10,061
- Alices's vision.
- I was trying to protect you.

210
00:19:10,061 --> 00:19:12,240
By lying to me.

211
00:19:14,757 --> 00:19:17,021
Okey. We're gonna talk
about this, but...

212
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:18,799
You!

213
00:19:19,362 --> 00:19:21,170
Why haven't you
called me back?

214
00:19:24,282 --> 00:19:26,704
I had nothing to say.

215
00:19:28,506 --> 00:19:31,128
- Well, I have tons. Hold on.
- Hey.

216
00:19:33,016 --> 00:19:34,218
Bella.

217
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,592
- Edward, you have to trust me.
- I do trust you.

218
00:19:38,768 --> 00:19:40,525
It's him I don't trust.

219
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:54,781
Lose the grin, Jacob.
We're just going for a ride.

220
00:19:54,781 --> 00:19:56,756
Hold on tight.

221
00:20:10,225 --> 00:20:12,186
Are you sure,
this is a good idea?

222
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,707
I'm a "vampire girl",
remember?

223
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:20,275
- Look who's back.
- Whatup, Bella?

224
00:20:20,275 --> 00:20:23,994
- Quil, you too?
- Yep. Finally made the pack.

225
00:20:23,994 --> 00:20:25,071
I'm glad you're here, Bella.

226
00:20:25,071 --> 00:20:27,745
Maybe we can get a break from
Jake's obsessive inner monologue.

227
00:20:27,745 --> 00:20:29,331
"I wish Bella would call".

228
00:20:29,431 --> 00:20:31,965
- "I wish Bella wouldn't call".
- "Maybe I should call Bella".

229
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:34,088
"Maybe I should call Bella
and hang up".

230
00:20:35,102 --> 00:20:37,037
Alright, you can shut up now.

231
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:43,508
Bella, this is Leah Clearwater.
Harry's daughter.

232
00:20:44,113 --> 00:20:47,367
Hey.
I'm really sorry about your father.

233
00:20:47,367 --> 00:20:50,373
If you're here to torture Jacob
some more, feel free to leave.

234
00:20:53,715 --> 00:20:55,429
Fun, isn't she?

235
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,982
- Bella... Hi.
- Hey.

236
00:20:58,982 --> 00:21:01,738
I was wondering when we'd see
your face around here again.

237
00:21:01,738 --> 00:21:03,679
Yeah, same here.

238
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,012
Sam, we're good?

239
00:21:05,012 --> 00:21:08,229
We're good. She won't be getting
through our line anytime soon.

240
00:21:19,555 --> 00:21:22,332
So, when did Leah
joined the pack?

241
00:21:22,332 --> 00:21:26,915
Around when her Dad died.
Her brother Seth, also phased.

242
00:21:26,915 --> 00:21:31,044
He's only fifteen.
One of the youngest we've had.

243
00:21:31,044 --> 00:21:34,052
Sam keeps him home studying,
but he's chomping at the bit.

244
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:37,247
Wish it was Leah
who'd stay home.

245
00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:39,695
Come on,
don't be such a guy.

246
00:21:40,391 --> 00:21:46,291
No, it's... It's not a chick thing.
It's... You know, a triangle thing.

247
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:50,398
We all have to live
the Leah, Sam, Emily pain-fest.

248
00:21:51,714 --> 00:21:53,826
Wolf telepathy, remember?

249
00:21:53,826 --> 00:21:56,587
So, Sam dumps Leah
for Emily?

250
00:21:56,587 --> 00:22:01,744
It wasn't like that.
Sam hates himself for hurting Leah.

251
00:22:01,744 --> 00:22:04,184
But, Emily was The One.

252
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:07,697
Yeah, I guess it's sort of
chooses you sometimes.

253
00:22:09,915 --> 00:22:14,315
It's more than some crush, Bella.
Sam imprinted on Emily.

254
00:22:15,956 --> 00:22:17,630
Do I want to know what that is?

255
00:22:27,404 --> 00:22:31,131
Imprinting on someone
is like...

256
00:22:32,404 --> 00:22:37,620
Like when you see her,
everything changes.

257
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:43,153
All of a sudden, it's not
gravity holding you to the planet.

258
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,403
It's her.

259
00:22:46,126 --> 00:22:51,526
Nothing else matters.
You would do anything...

260
00:22:52,802 --> 00:22:55,674
Be anything for her.

261
00:22:57,567 --> 00:23:00,138
It sounds like
you know the feeling.

262
00:23:03,714 --> 00:23:08,814
Have you...
imprinted on someone?

263
00:23:14,248 --> 00:23:16,347
You'd know if I had.

264
00:23:19,935 --> 00:23:22,704
I just have a direct line
to Sam's thoughts.

265
00:23:24,715 --> 00:23:28,689
So for now, you're...
still you.

266
00:23:30,928 --> 00:23:35,334
- And you're still you.
- Yeah.

267
00:23:40,797 --> 00:23:42,877
Until graduation.

268
00:23:43,912 --> 00:23:45,567
graduation?

269
00:23:46,877 --> 00:23:48,592
You knew
this was gonna happen.

270
00:23:48,592 --> 00:23:50,342
Not in a month!

271
00:23:52,254 --> 00:23:56,527
I mean, not before you've...
you've even lived!

272
00:23:57,567 --> 00:23:59,801
Or before I could...

273
00:24:03,182 --> 00:24:07,936
For a second, just a second,
I thought...

274
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:12,145
But he's got his hooks in you
so deep.

275
00:24:12,731 --> 00:24:16,711
- I decided this, not him.
- Bella, they're not even a live!

276
00:24:18,086 --> 00:24:20,062
It makes me sick!

277
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:25,288
Better you really be dead
than one of them.

278
00:24:38,245 --> 00:24:40,177
I can't believe you said that.

279
00:24:44,494 --> 00:24:46,736
Edward was right,
I shouldn't have come.

280
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:49,929
Bella, come on.
Please.

281
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,928
I'm sorry.

282
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,363
You know...

283
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:07,874
Edward could at least
respect meal times.

284
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:11,161
I was just with Jake.

285
00:26:11,161 --> 00:26:14,612
Oh...
Good.

286
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:22,742
I'll just give you two
some privacy then.

287
00:26:24,825 --> 00:26:25,507
Hey.

288
00:26:25,507 --> 00:26:27,278
Do you understand
how worried I've been?

289
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:28,601
I was perfectly safe.

290
00:26:28,601 --> 00:26:31,087
I almost break the treaty
to make sure of it.

291
00:26:32,062 --> 00:26:34,491
- I know, I smell like a dog. I'm sorry.
- No, no. Something's wrong.

292
00:26:42,192 --> 00:26:45,258
- Edward, what's wrong?
- Someone's been in here.

293
00:26:51,153 --> 00:26:54,497
Who was it?
Someone we know?

294
00:26:54,497 --> 00:26:57,622
Just a stranger.
I didn't recognize his scent.

295
00:26:57,622 --> 00:26:59,229
A nomad passing through?

296
00:26:59,229 --> 00:27:01,921
A passer-by wouldn't have left
Bella's father alive.

297
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:04,854
His scent disappeared about five miles
south of Bella's house.

298
00:27:06,662 --> 00:27:09,962
- Someone's orchestrating this.
- Victoria?

299
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:14,400
- I would've seen her deciding.
- It has to be the Volturi.

300
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,114
I don't think
it's the Volturi either.

301
00:27:17,114 --> 00:27:18,779
I've been watching
Aro's decisions, too.

302
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:20,109
So we keep looking.

303
00:27:20,109 --> 00:27:22,775
We also take shifts,
guarding Bella at her house.

304
00:27:23,163 --> 00:27:26,160
- A nother protection detail?
- Rosalie.

305
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:28,915
No, she's right.

306
00:27:29,015 --> 00:27:31,731
You can't protect me,
watch my dad...

307
00:27:31,731 --> 00:27:33,414
and search for the intruder.

308
00:27:33,414 --> 00:27:37,005
- And for Victoria.
- And keep yourselves fed.

309
00:27:37,005 --> 00:27:38,747
I'm not leaving you here
defenseless.

310
00:27:38,747 --> 00:27:40,795
Well, I'm not gonna
let you starve.

311
00:27:41,881 --> 00:27:45,839
And I wouldn't be unprotected,
I have...

312
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:47,727
What?

313
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:57,924
Whoever it was,
he left his stink behind.

314
00:27:57,924 --> 00:28:00,702
It'll be hard to miss
when we cross it again.

315
00:28:00,702 --> 00:28:03,780
- We'll handle it from here.
- We don't need you to handle anything.

316
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:07,610
- Or anyone.
- I could care less what you need.

317
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,493
Alright, we're done here.

318
00:28:09,493 --> 00:28:12,377
- No, you're done here.
- Stop!

319
00:28:12,377 --> 00:28:15,698
I'm tired of this.
From now on I'm Switzerland, Okay?

320
00:28:17,199 --> 00:28:21,820
<i>Edward hated the idea,
but it wasn't about rivalry anymore.</i>

321
00:28:22,466 --> 00:28:25,143
<i>It was about my safety,
and Charlie's.</i>

322
00:28:26,314 --> 00:28:29,797
<i>In the days that followed
I got them to at least try to work together.</i>

323
00:28:35,728 --> 00:28:38,188
<i>The wolves took over
so the Cullen's can hunt.</i>

324
00:28:41,421 --> 00:28:43,940
<i>It wasn't exactly
an easy alliance.</i>

325
00:29:00,476 --> 00:29:02,114
Doesn't he own a shirt?

326
00:29:07,013 --> 00:29:09,024
I'm good here,
you should go.

327
00:29:09,024 --> 00:29:14,330
- I'm not gonna be going long.
- Don't rush. You need to hunt.

328
00:29:30,579 --> 00:29:32,715
Maybe you rush a little bit.

329
00:29:38,029 --> 00:29:40,040
- Hey, beautiful.
- Hi.

330
00:29:50,809 --> 00:29:55,154
So, whaddaya wanna do today?
Bike, hike, hang?

331
00:29:55,154 --> 00:29:57,930
Your call.
Or we're going to a party tonight.

332
00:30:00,953 --> 00:30:05,209
You sure this is okay?
I really hate being a party crasher.

333
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:08,713
Technically,
you're a Council Meeting crasher.

334
00:30:09,436 --> 00:30:14,536
See. The Council leaders,
Dad, Quil's grandpa, and Sue Clearwater.

335
00:30:15,168 --> 00:30:17,059
She took over for Harry
when he died.

336
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:18,856
Okay, I should not be here.

337
00:30:19,675 --> 00:30:23,337
You're okay.
I thought...

338
00:30:23,337 --> 00:30:26,332
I mean, they thought it would be
good for you to hear the histories.

339
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:32,070
The histories? The tribe's histories?
Aren't they secret?

340
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:36,690
We all got a role to play.
And you're a part of this.

341
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,486
I mean, it's the first time Seth,
Leah and Quil are hearing them, too.

342
00:30:40,486 --> 00:30:43,884
But you are the first outsider.
Ever.

343
00:30:46,021 --> 00:30:47,815
If I haven't known that,
I wouldn't believe you.

344
00:30:49,903 --> 00:30:52,444
- And would've dressed better.
- Jake.

345
00:30:53,508 --> 00:30:56,467
- Hey.
- It's about time, you got here.

346
00:30:56,467 --> 00:30:59,618
Paul's been hoovering the grub.
But, I saved you some burgers.

347
00:30:59,618 --> 00:31:01,843
Good looking out, Bro.

348
00:31:01,843 --> 00:31:04,841
Bella, this is Seth Clearwater,
Leah's brother.

349
00:31:04,841 --> 00:31:08,943
- Newest member of the pack.
- Newest, bestest, brightest.

350
00:31:08,943 --> 00:31:10,584
And slowest.

351
00:31:13,253 --> 00:31:15,462
- Come on. Your dad's about to start.
- Alright.

352
00:31:17,763 --> 00:31:20,838
The Quileutes have been a small tribe
from the beginning...

353
00:31:21,962 --> 00:31:24,568
But we've always had magic in
our blood.

354
00:31:26,716 --> 00:31:29,094
We were great spirit warriors...

355
00:31:29,094 --> 00:31:34,194
Shape shifters,
that transform into the powerful wolf.

356
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:39,259
This enabled us to scare off
our enemies,

357
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:41,865
and protect our tribe.

358
00:31:43,448 --> 00:31:48,448
One day our warriors
came across a creature...

359
00:31:49,538 --> 00:31:54,638
<i>It looked like a man,
but it was hard like stone,</i>

360
00:31:54,638 --> 00:31:56,994
<i>and cold as ice...</i>

361
00:32:16,624 --> 00:32:20,792
Our warriors' sharp teeth,
finally tore it apart...

362
00:32:20,792 --> 00:32:24,630
But only fire
would completely destroy it.

363
00:32:25,412 --> 00:32:29,203
They lived in fear,
the Cold Man was not alone.

364
00:32:30,425 --> 00:32:32,049
And they were right.

365
00:32:35,992 --> 00:32:39,252
<i>She took her vengeance out
on the village.</i>

366
00:32:41,735 --> 00:32:44,086
<i>Our elder chief,
Taha Aki,</i>

367
00:32:44,086 --> 00:32:47,581
<i>was the only spirit warrior left
to save the tribe,</i>

368
00:32:47,581 --> 00:32:50,363
<i>after his son was killed.</i>

369
00:33:01,595 --> 00:33:05,349
<i>Taha Aki's Third Wife could sees
that he would lose...</i>

370
00:33:06,385 --> 00:33:10,311
<i>The Third Wife
was no magical being,</i>

371
00:33:10,311 --> 00:33:13,110
<i>no special powers, but one...</i>

372
00:33:14,646 --> 00:33:16,527
Courage.

373
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:30,726
The Third Wife's sacrifice
distracted the Cold Woman,

374
00:33:30,726 --> 00:33:34,360
long enough for Taha Aki
to destroy her.

375
00:33:34,866 --> 00:33:37,001
She saved the tribe.

376
00:33:37,592 --> 00:33:40,882
Over time,
our enemies have disappeared.

377
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:43,738
But one remains...

378
00:33:45,142 --> 00:33:47,287
The Cold Ones.

379
00:33:49,501 --> 00:33:52,043
Our magic awakens
when they near.

380
00:33:52,043 --> 00:33:56,227
And we sense it now,
we feel the threat in our blood.

381
00:33:57,896 --> 00:34:00,070
Something terrible is coming.

382
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:07,173
And we must all be ready.
All of us.

383
00:34:34,173 --> 00:34:36,048
What did you do to me?

384
00:34:40,361 --> 00:34:44,485
- I'm so...
- Yeah, I know...

385
00:34:45,809 --> 00:34:47,533
We'll find you someone
to drink.

386
00:34:55,746 --> 00:34:59,025
Just try not to get killed,
will you?

387
00:35:01,862 --> 00:35:03,984
I'm gonna need numbers.

388
00:35:05,381 --> 00:35:07,500
<i>Seattle is in a state of terror...</i>

389
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,431
<i>Police are baffled by the
escalating murders and disappearances.</i>

390
00:35:11,431 --> 00:35:15,777
<i>Theories range from a vicious new gang
to a wildly active serial killer...</i>

391
00:35:15,777 --> 00:35:18,302
<i>- Reporting live, Dawn Chubai. CNN.</i>
- It's getting worse.

392
00:35:18,302 --> 00:35:20,419
We're going to have
to do something.

393
00:35:20,419 --> 00:35:24,638
It takes more than one of our kind
to cause the damage they're reporting.

394
00:35:24,638 --> 00:35:28,690
Quite a few more.
They're undisciplined, conspicuous...

395
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,449
It's a Newborns.

396
00:35:31,725 --> 00:35:33,590
What, like new vampires?

397
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,775
In their first few months
after the change.

398
00:35:35,775 --> 00:35:38,287
That's when we're at our most
uncontrollable,

399
00:35:38,287 --> 00:35:42,338
vicious, insane with thirst.

400
00:35:42,338 --> 00:35:45,054
Something to look forward to.

401
00:35:46,548 --> 00:35:50,085
No one has trained these newborns,
but this isn't random.

402
00:35:50,499 --> 00:35:52,360
Someone's creating an army.

403
00:35:53,071 --> 00:35:55,193
Oh, now we definitely
going to Seattle.

404
00:35:56,127 --> 00:35:58,157
An Army of vampires?

405
00:35:58,157 --> 00:35:59,831
And they've been created
to fight someone.

406
00:35:59,831 --> 00:36:01,741
We're the only clan
even close to Seattle.

407
00:36:01,741 --> 00:36:02,945
Regardless,
of who are they were may,

408
00:36:02,945 --> 00:36:05,304
if we don't put a stop to them,
the Volturi will.

409
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:08,781
I'm surprised
they've let it go on this long.

410
00:36:08,781 --> 00:36:10,313
Maybe they're behind it.

411
00:36:11,313 --> 00:36:14,059
In Italy,
I read Aro's mind...

412
00:36:14,059 --> 00:36:15,776
He wants me and Alice
to join him...

413
00:36:15,776 --> 00:36:19,083
He knows we'd never choose him
as long as our family is still alive.

414
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:21,770
An army
could solve that for him.

415
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:33,838
Hey.
Did you eat dinner yet?

416
00:36:35,745 --> 00:36:38,169
Um... no...
I haven't.

417
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:46,075
This kid Riley Biers,
disappeared over a year ago.

418
00:36:46,601 --> 00:36:50,561
And his poor parents been papering
Seattle with these things ever since.

419
00:36:52,071 --> 00:36:53,986
You think
they should just give up?

420
00:36:56,768 --> 00:36:59,740
I wouldn't.
If it were you...

421
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:03,523
Not ever.

422
00:37:09,308 --> 00:37:11,433
<i>I have to figure out
what to tell people...</i>

423
00:37:12,365 --> 00:37:14,756
Whu I won't be home
for Christmases.

424
00:37:16,071 --> 00:37:18,533
Why I won't visit.

425
00:37:19,552 --> 00:37:21,868
Why they'll never see me again.

426
00:37:22,314 --> 00:37:26,915
After a few decades,
everyone you know will be dead.

427
00:37:28,984 --> 00:37:30,997
Problem solved.

428
00:37:35,496 --> 00:37:38,049
Why are you so against me
becoming like you?

429
00:37:38,752 --> 00:37:40,747
I've told you.

430
00:37:43,153 --> 00:37:47,653
Be honest with me.
There's more.

431
00:37:48,275 --> 00:37:53,175
I know the consequences,
of this choice you're making.

432
00:37:57,883 --> 00:38:03,734
I've lived through it,
and to let you suffer that.

433
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:08,213
You believe I have a soul...

434
00:38:08,213 --> 00:38:10,228
I don't.

435
00:38:12,396 --> 00:38:17,096
But to risk yours, just for the sake
of never having to lose you.

436
00:38:19,495 --> 00:38:22,171
It's the most selfish thing
I'll ever do.

437
00:38:26,263 --> 00:38:30,315
I thought, maybe you were afraid
that I'll be too different.

438
00:38:32,335 --> 00:38:36,255
Unlike. I won't be, you know...
warm.

439
00:38:36,255 --> 00:38:38,303
And won't smell the same.

440
00:38:47,237 --> 00:38:50,140
You'll always be my Bella.

441
00:39:10,659 --> 00:39:13,858
My Bella, just less fragile.

442
00:39:24,179 --> 00:39:26,320
Gosh, it's so pretty here.

443
00:39:31,856 --> 00:39:35,031
So, Alice is planning
a big graduation party.

444
00:39:36,036 --> 00:39:37,803
Which you're invited to.

445
00:39:41,748 --> 00:39:44,735
Yeah,
I figured that.

446
00:39:52,183 --> 00:39:53,438
What?

447
00:39:55,256 --> 00:39:57,472
I just wanted to do this
differently.

448
00:39:58,292 --> 00:39:59,723
Smoother.

449
00:40:01,202 --> 00:40:03,177
But now, I'm out of time.

450
00:40:04,521 --> 00:40:05,899
To what?

451
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:09,005
You need to hear the truth,
Bella.

452
00:40:09,805 --> 00:40:12,338
Understand all your options.

453
00:40:13,792 --> 00:40:15,617
You need to know...

454
00:40:17,004 --> 00:40:19,759
That I'm in love with you.

455
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:24,067
And I want you to choose me,
instead of him.

456
00:40:25,832 --> 00:40:27,633
I thought you understood.

457
00:40:30,788 --> 00:40:33,335
- I don't feel that way for you.
- I don't buy it.

458
00:40:33,335 --> 00:40:34,951
What don't you buy?

459
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:38,925
That's how I feel.

460
00:40:38,925 --> 00:40:42,772
You feel something else for me,
you just won't admit it.

461
00:40:43,777 --> 00:40:48,877
So I'm not giving up.
I'm gonna fight for you.

462
00:40:51,556 --> 00:40:53,996
Until your heart stops beating.

463
00:40:54,627 --> 00:40:56,320
Well, then you're not gonna have
to fight for long.

464
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,717
You're rushing into it because
you're afraid you'll change your mind.

465
00:40:58,717 --> 00:41:00,220
No, I'm not.

466
00:41:01,743 --> 00:41:03,138
I know what I want.

467
00:41:04,966 --> 00:41:07,891
You wouldn't have
to change for me, Bella.

468
00:41:08,691 --> 00:41:11,250
Or say goodbye to anybody.

469
00:41:11,983 --> 00:41:14,989
I can give you more than him.

470
00:41:15,476 --> 00:41:18,795
I mean, he probably can't even
kiss you without hurting you.

471
00:41:21,218 --> 00:41:23,608
Feel that?

472
00:41:23,608 --> 00:41:27,921
Flesh and blood and warmth.

473
00:41:52,044 --> 00:41:52,800
Edward!

474
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,270
If you ever touch her
against her will again!

475
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:57,237
- Don't do this!
- She's not sure what she wants!

476
00:41:57,237 --> 00:41:58,716
- Don't do this!
- Well, let me give you a clue!

477
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:02,807
- Wait for her to say the words!
- Fine! And she will!

478
00:42:02,807 --> 00:42:05,812
- Jacob. Just go, okay!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey...

479
00:42:05,812 --> 00:42:10,329
Easy guys, easy.
Let's take it down a notch. Alright?

480
00:42:13,377 --> 00:42:14,998
What's going on?

481
00:42:18,409 --> 00:42:20,206
I kissed Bella.

482
00:42:24,105 --> 00:42:26,387
And she broke her hand...

483
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,914
Punching my face.

484
00:42:31,044 --> 00:42:33,436
Total misunderstanding.

485
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:38,732
It's just a sprain,
should heal fairly quickly.

486
00:42:40,359 --> 00:42:43,323
Trying to walk and chew gum
at the same time again, Bella?

487
00:42:44,774 --> 00:42:47,871
- I punched a werewolf in the face.
- Bad ass...

488
00:42:47,871 --> 00:42:51,047
You're gonna be
one tough little newborn.

489
00:42:51,047 --> 00:42:53,511
Tough enough to take you on.

490
00:42:59,062 --> 00:43:01,208
Don't worry about it.

491
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:05,791
Okay, any Leads?

492
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:10,177
No sign of the intruder. But Victoria
continues to make appearances.

493
00:43:17,685 --> 00:43:20,920
Go blather to someone else
about the joys of becoming a newborn.

494
00:43:24,682 --> 00:43:28,479
Okay.
Rosalie...

495
00:43:30,697 --> 00:43:33,921
I don't understand what I did,
to make you hate me so much.

496
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:38,685
I don't hate you.

497
00:43:41,082 --> 00:43:43,843
I don't particularly like you,
but...

498
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:52,975
- Bella, I envy you.
- What?

499
00:43:54,207 --> 00:43:56,684
- That's ridiculous.
- No, it's not.

500
00:43:58,743 --> 00:44:02,002
You have a choice.
I didn't.

501
00:44:02,865 --> 00:44:06,179
None of us did. But you do,
and you're choosing wrong.

502
00:44:07,574 --> 00:44:10,687
I don't care how miserable
your human life is.

503
00:44:11,416 --> 00:44:14,598
My life is not miserable.

504
00:44:17,257 --> 00:44:20,882
It's not perfect,
but nobody's life is perfect.

505
00:44:20,882 --> 00:44:25,182
Mine was.
Absolutely perfect.

506
00:44:26,721 --> 00:44:28,970
Everything as I still wanted.

507
00:44:29,841 --> 00:44:31,926
To be married,
with a nice house and a husband...

508
00:44:31,926 --> 00:44:34,008
to kiss me when he came home.

509
00:44:34,008 --> 00:44:36,161
A family of my own.

510
00:44:36,845 --> 00:44:39,845
<i>Royce King was
the most eligible bachelor in town.</i>

511
00:44:41,439 --> 00:44:43,207
<i>I barely knew him.</i>

512
00:44:47,517 --> 00:44:52,030
<i>But I was young.
I was in love with the idea of love.</i>

513
00:44:53,037 --> 00:44:56,601
<i>On the last night of my life,
I left a friend's house late.</i>

514
00:44:56,601 --> 00:44:59,933
<i>- I wasn't far from home.</i>
- Here she is.

515
00:44:59,933 --> 00:45:02,934
Hey, Rose!
Come over here!

516
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:04,623
Here, hold this.

517
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:08,963
Hey, come over here.
We've been waiting for you.

518
00:45:10,584 --> 00:45:12,617
Here she is

519
00:45:14,488 --> 00:45:15,704
Royce.

520
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,656
You're drunk.

521
00:45:18,656 --> 00:45:22,122
Isn't she lovely, John?
I told you she was a looker.

522
00:45:22,122 --> 00:45:25,042
It's hard to say
with all those clothes on.

523
00:45:25,042 --> 00:45:29,345
What do you say, Rose?
Why don't we take off a few layers?

524
00:45:29,345 --> 00:45:31,573
Stop it!...

525
00:45:33,816 --> 00:45:36,364
I'll see you tomorrow.
Sober.

526
00:45:38,037 --> 00:45:39,576
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

527
00:45:39,576 --> 00:45:43,688
- Stop it! Just stop it! Let go! Stop it!
- Comeback! Hey, you'll do as I say!

528
00:45:49,044 --> 00:45:52,439
They left me in the street,
thinking I was dead.

529
00:45:52,439 --> 00:45:54,488
Believe me, I wanted to be.

530
00:45:56,037 --> 00:45:58,540
Carlisle found me,
he smelled all the blood...

531
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:01,442
- Thought he was helping me.
- I'm sorry.

532
00:46:04,215 --> 00:46:06,427
I got my revenge on them.

533
00:46:08,045 --> 00:46:10,042
One at a time.

534
00:46:10,042 --> 00:46:13,433
I saved Royce for last,
so he'd know I was coming.

535
00:46:31,467 --> 00:46:34,073
I was a little theatrical back then.

536
00:46:42,682 --> 00:46:44,930
Things got better
after I found Emmett.

537
00:46:48,002 --> 00:46:49,940
But we'll always be this.

538
00:46:53,956 --> 00:46:58,277
Frozen,
never moving forward.

539
00:46:59,689 --> 00:47:03,722
That's what I miss the most,
the possibilities.

540
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,718
Sitting on a front porch
somewhere,

541
00:47:07,293 --> 00:47:09,956
Emmett gray haired
by my side,

542
00:47:09,956 --> 00:47:12,742
surrounded by
our grandchildren,

543
00:47:13,928 --> 00:47:16,049
their laughter.

544
00:47:17,676 --> 00:47:20,644
I understand,
that's what you want.

545
00:47:27,454 --> 00:47:31,190
But there's nothing
I'll ever gonna want, more...

546
00:47:33,103 --> 00:47:35,015
than Edward.

547
00:47:35,395 --> 00:47:37,074
You're wrong again.

548
00:47:39,239 --> 00:47:42,460
After you've been changed,
there's one thing you'll want more...

549
00:47:43,572 --> 00:47:45,595
One thing you'll kill for...

550
00:47:47,827 --> 00:47:49,572
Blood.

551
00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:58,464
What did I say,
about low profile?

552
00:48:10,807 --> 00:48:12,736
Something's coming...

553
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:19,444
Something...
Bigger than any of us alone.

554
00:48:20,262 --> 00:48:22,237
And if you can't...

555
00:48:23,376 --> 00:48:25,692
control yourselves...

556
00:48:27,555 --> 00:48:29,490
We're all going to die.

557
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:36,699
What's done is done,
just...

558
00:48:39,044 --> 00:48:41,345
clean up after yourselves.

559
00:48:49,989 --> 00:48:53,120
They've already drawn
too much attention.

560
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:55,431
So has our "inaction".

561
00:48:55,431 --> 00:48:58,966
Others may begin to question
the Volturi's effectiveness.

562
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,657
Let them.

563
00:49:06,966 --> 00:49:09,285
Maybe we should consult
with Aro.

564
00:49:14,183 --> 00:49:16,556
Aro's decisions
are being watched.

565
00:49:18,631 --> 00:49:20,510
We must decide.

566
00:49:22,604 --> 00:49:26,550
Then decide sister.
It's time.

567
00:49:27,811 --> 00:49:29,678
Yes, it is.

568
00:49:34,493 --> 00:49:38,332
Either we let them do
what they were created for...

569
00:49:38,332 --> 00:49:40,089
Or we end them.

570
00:49:41,118 --> 00:49:43,704
Decisions, decisions...

571
00:49:53,496 --> 00:49:54,609
When we were five,

572
00:49:54,609 --> 00:49:57,942
they asked us what we wanted to be
when we grew up...

573
00:49:57,942 --> 00:50:02,601
Our answers were things like
astronaut, president...

574
00:50:02,601 --> 00:50:05,402
Or in my case, a princess.

575
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:07,941
When we were ten,
they asked again,

576
00:50:07,941 --> 00:50:10,995
and we answered,
rock star, cowboy,

577
00:50:10,995 --> 00:50:13,833
or in my case,
a gold medalist.

578
00:50:13,833 --> 00:50:17,245
But now that we've grown up,
they want a serious answer.

579
00:50:18,302 --> 00:50:21,092
Well, how about this...

580
00:50:21,092 --> 00:50:23,165
who the hell knows?

581
00:50:26,928 --> 00:50:29,129
This isn't the time to make
hard and fast decisions,

582
00:50:29,129 --> 00:50:31,803
this is the time
to make mistakes.

583
00:50:31,803 --> 00:50:34,905
Take the wrong train
and get stuck somewhere.

584
00:50:34,905 --> 00:50:38,374
Fall in love,
a lot.

585
00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:43,215
Major in philosophy, because there's
no way to make a career out of that.

586
00:50:43,215 --> 00:50:46,730
Change your mind, and change it again,
because nothing is permanent.

587
00:50:47,905 --> 00:50:50,397
So, make as many mistakes
as you can.

588
00:50:51,188 --> 00:50:53,644
That way, someday,
when they ask what we wanna be...

589
00:50:54,358 --> 00:50:59,335
we won't have to guess.
We'll know.

590
00:51:26,677 --> 00:51:28,504
You've made it!

591
00:51:28,504 --> 00:51:30,979
- Hey.
- What'd you think of my speech?

592
00:51:30,979 --> 00:51:33,557
Too easy-breezy, too self-helpful?
You may admit it.

593
00:51:33,987 --> 00:51:36,844
- No, you pretty much nailed it.
- Yeah?

594
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:41,200
- It's like I was born to lead, right?
- Oh, great. I love this song, let's go.

595
00:52:05,878 --> 00:52:09,667
- What are you doing here?
- You invited me, remember?

596
00:52:10,396 --> 00:52:12,974
Was my right hook
too subtle for you?

597
00:52:12,974 --> 00:52:15,196
That was me
uninviting you.

598
00:52:15,196 --> 00:52:19,216
Look, Bella. I'm sorry...
about, you know...

599
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:23,600
The kiss and your hand...

600
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,242
I'd blame it on the whole
inner animal thing...

601
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:29,988
But it was really just... me.
Being an ass.

602
00:52:30,827 --> 00:52:32,582
I'm really sorry.

603
00:52:33,937 --> 00:52:35,504
I brought you something.

604
00:52:36,023 --> 00:52:39,685
A graduation present.
I made it myself.

605
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,478
Oh...
You made this?

606
00:52:44,423 --> 00:52:47,600
It's really pretty.
Thanks.

607
00:53:02,251 --> 00:53:03,710
I'll be right back.

608
00:53:06,565 --> 00:53:09,725
- Alice, what did you see?
- The decision's been made.

609
00:53:09,725 --> 00:53:13,096
- What's going on?
- You're not going to Seattle?

610
00:53:13,096 --> 00:53:15,114
No...

611
00:53:15,114 --> 00:53:16,808
They're coming here.

612
00:53:17,557 --> 00:53:21,088
- They'll be here in four days.
- This could turn into a blood bath.

613
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:24,438
- Who's behind it?
- I didn't see anyone I recognize.

614
00:53:25,592 --> 00:53:27,701
Maybe one...

615
00:53:27,701 --> 00:53:31,382
I know his face.
He's local, Riley Biers.

616
00:53:31,901 --> 00:53:33,003
He didn't start this.

617
00:53:33,003 --> 00:53:35,451
Whoever did
is staying out of the action.

618
00:53:35,451 --> 00:53:37,808
They must be playing with
the blind spots in your vision.

619
00:53:37,808 --> 00:53:39,418
Either way,
the army is coming...

620
00:53:39,418 --> 00:53:41,715
and there aren't enough of us
to protect the town.

621
00:53:41,715 --> 00:53:44,431
Hold up!
What damn army?

622
00:53:44,431 --> 00:53:47,997
- Newborns. Our kind.
- What are they after?

623
00:53:47,997 --> 00:53:51,535
They were passing around
Bella's scent. A red blouse.

624
00:53:51,535 --> 00:53:53,661
They're after Bella?

625
00:53:53,661 --> 00:53:56,781
- What the hell does this mean?
- It means an ugly fight.

626
00:53:56,781 --> 00:53:59,003
With lives lost.

627
00:54:03,203 --> 00:54:04,907
Alright...

628
00:54:04,907 --> 00:54:07,411
- We're in.
- No.

629
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:09,504
You'll get yourselves killed,
noway.

630
00:54:09,504 --> 00:54:14,024
- I wasn't asking for permission.
- Edward.

631
00:54:17,373 --> 00:54:19,659
It means
more protection for you.

632
00:54:20,274 --> 00:54:25,374
Jacob. Do you believe Sam
will agree to... an understanding?

633
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:29,450
As long as we get to kill
some vampires.

634
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:33,845
- Jasper?
- They'll give us the numbers.

635
00:54:33,845 --> 00:54:36,488
And the newborns won't know
they even exist.

636
00:54:36,488 --> 00:54:39,204
- That'll give us an edge.
- We'll need to coordinate.

637
00:54:39,204 --> 00:54:43,274
- Carlisle, they'll gonna get hurt.
- We'll all need some training.

638
00:54:43,274 --> 00:54:46,301
Fighting newborns requires
knowledge that Jasper has.

639
00:54:46,301 --> 00:54:48,155
You're welcome to join us.

640
00:54:49,698 --> 00:54:52,927
Alright.
Name the time and place.

641
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:54,549
Jake...

642
00:54:54,549 --> 00:54:57,310
You don't know
what you're getting yourself in to.

643
00:54:58,248 --> 00:55:00,225
Bella...

644
00:55:00,225 --> 00:55:04,496
This is what we do.
You should be happy.

645
00:55:04,496 --> 00:55:07,565
Look at us, working together.

646
00:55:07,565 --> 00:55:10,876
You're the one who wanted us
to get along, remember?

647
00:55:20,749 --> 00:55:22,201
Again!

648
00:55:35,069 --> 00:55:37,201
It's a graduation present.

649
00:55:56,397 --> 00:55:59,174
They don't trust us enough
to be in their human forms.

650
00:55:59,174 --> 00:56:01,682
They came.
That's what matters.

651
00:56:02,628 --> 00:56:04,552
Will you translate?

652
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,325
Hey, Jake.

653
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,636
Welcome.

654
00:56:20,478 --> 00:56:23,030
Jasper has experience
with newborns.

655
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:25,223
He'll teach us
how to defeat them.

656
00:56:27,674 --> 00:56:29,716
They want to know
how the "newborns" is differ from us.

657
00:56:30,842 --> 00:56:32,468
They're a great deal
stronger than us,

658
00:56:32,468 --> 00:56:35,432
because their own human blood
lingers in their tissues.

659
00:56:36,125 --> 00:56:39,886
Our kind is never more
physically powerful...

660
00:56:39,886 --> 00:56:42,467
than in our first several months
of this life.

661
00:56:45,587 --> 00:56:47,751
Carlisle's right.

662
00:56:47,751 --> 00:56:50,109
That's why
they are created.

663
00:56:50,694 --> 00:56:54,591
A newborn army, doesn't need
thousands like a human army.

664
00:56:55,314 --> 00:56:57,691
And no human army
could stand against them.

665
00:56:59,561 --> 00:57:02,640
The two most important things
to remember are, first...

666
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,303
Never let them
get their arms around you.

667
00:57:04,303 --> 00:57:07,439
They'll crush you instantly.
The second...

668
00:57:09,012 --> 00:57:11,828
Never go
for the obvious kill.

669
00:57:13,294 --> 00:57:18,394
They'll be expecting that.
And you will lose.

670
00:57:19,934 --> 00:57:21,647
Emmett?

671
00:57:28,351 --> 00:57:31,729
Don't hold back.
Not in my nature.

672
00:57:46,021 --> 00:57:47,580
Never lose focus.

673
00:58:08,687 --> 00:58:10,001
One more thing...

674
00:58:10,899 --> 00:58:13,510
Never turn your back
on your enemy.

675
00:59:00,639 --> 00:59:02,418
Some of you,
are gonna get hurt.

676
00:59:05,739 --> 00:59:09,539
Some of you
could get killed, because of me.

677
00:59:12,177 --> 00:59:14,634
It's gonna be a hundred times
worse than this, right?

678
00:59:37,728 --> 00:59:39,764
We're done for the day.

679
00:59:52,327 --> 00:59:54,353
Jasper...

680
00:59:56,845 --> 00:59:59,778
Are you sure, there's nothing
I can do to help?

681
00:59:59,778 --> 01:00:03,405
Your presence alone,
your scent will distract the newborns.

682
01:00:03,405 --> 01:00:07,813
Their hunting instinct will take over,
drive them crazy.

683
01:00:08,934 --> 01:00:11,067
Good. I'm glad.

684
01:00:13,158 --> 01:00:14,744
Hey.

685
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:16,898
How do you know so much
about this?

686
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:22,877
I didn't have quite the same upbringing
as my adopted siblings.

687
01:00:28,810 --> 01:00:30,438
Those bites are like mine.

688
01:00:31,281 --> 01:00:32,833
Battle scars.

689
01:00:34,383 --> 01:00:37,115
All the training the Confederate Army
gave me...

690
01:00:37,115 --> 01:00:39,412
was useless against
the newborns.

691
01:00:40,472 --> 01:00:44,419
Still,
I never lost a fight.

692
01:00:49,248 --> 01:00:52,220
This has happened
during the civil war?

693
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:55,071
I was the youngest major
in the Texas cavalry.

694
01:00:55,071 --> 01:00:57,916
All without having seen
any real battle.

695
01:00:57,916 --> 01:00:59,131
Until...

696
01:01:00,924 --> 01:01:03,282
Until I'm not a certain immortal.

697
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:05,733
Maria.

698
01:01:10,132 --> 01:01:11,342
<i>I was riding back
to Galveston...</i>

699
01:01:11,342 --> 01:01:14,860
<i>after evacuating
a column of women and children.</i>

700
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:16,251
When I saw her...

701
01:01:17,399 --> 01:01:19,553
I immediately offered her my aid.

702
01:01:27,229 --> 01:01:30,415
Lovely. And an officer.

703
01:01:37,379 --> 01:01:42,579
You'd better do it, Maria.
I can never stop once I've started.

704
01:01:45,378 --> 01:01:50,161
- What's your name, soldier?
- Major Jasper Whitlock, Ma'am.

705
01:01:50,161 --> 01:01:51,910
I hope you survive.

706
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:56,389
You maybe of
a great use to me.

707
01:02:01,253 --> 01:02:03,281
Maria was creating an army?

708
01:02:03,281 --> 01:02:05,420
They were very common
in the South.

709
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:09,128
And cost a brutal battles
for territory.

710
01:02:09,128 --> 01:02:11,162
Maria won them all.

711
01:02:12,016 --> 01:02:17,016
She was smart, careful.
And she had me.

712
01:02:19,463 --> 01:02:22,308
<i>I was the second in command.</i>

713
01:02:22,308 --> 01:02:26,153
<i>My abilities to control emotions
served her well.</i>

714
01:02:27,053 --> 01:02:29,061
<i>I trained her newborns.</i>

715
01:02:32,117 --> 01:02:36,531
<i>An endless occupation since she never
let them live beyond their first year.</i>

716
01:02:39,530 --> 01:02:41,950
<i>It was my job
to dispose of them.</i>

717
01:03:02,526 --> 01:03:05,401
<i>I could feel
everything they felt.</i>

718
01:03:17,987 --> 01:03:20,709
I thought what Maria and I had
was love.

719
01:03:22,097 --> 01:03:26,797
But I was her puppet.
She pulled the strings.

720
01:03:27,964 --> 01:03:30,422
I didn't know
there was another way...

721
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:34,346
Until I found Alice.

722
01:03:35,846 --> 01:03:38,856
Now she'd seen me coming,
of course.

723
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:41,240
Kept me waiting long enough.

724
01:03:44,798 --> 01:03:46,771
My apologies, Ma'am.

725
01:03:48,427 --> 01:03:50,514
I don't know what I'd have become
without her.

726
01:03:53,286 --> 01:03:55,768
You'll never have to be
that again.

727
01:04:44,783 --> 01:04:45,860
What is it?

728
01:04:49,538 --> 01:04:52,640
The intruder...

729
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,935
The newborn army.

730
01:04:56,558 --> 01:04:59,039
They're all her puppets.

731
01:05:00,990 --> 01:05:02,451
Victoria.

732
01:05:03,541 --> 01:05:06,827
Alice would've seen
if she wanted to make an army.

733
01:05:06,827 --> 01:05:10,003
Unless she's hiding
behind them,

734
01:05:10,003 --> 01:05:12,287
and she's letting
someone else decide.

735
01:05:40,845 --> 01:05:43,096
Welcome to the army.

736
01:05:52,272 --> 01:05:53,129
I'm not just gonna hide,

737
01:05:53,129 --> 01:05:55,129
while you're taking
all the risks for me?

738
01:05:56,784 --> 01:05:57,645
If it's Victoria involved...

739
01:05:57,645 --> 01:06:00,194
I need to keep you as far away
from the fight as possible.

740
01:06:00,194 --> 01:06:02,494
Jasper said that
I could be of help.

741
01:06:02,494 --> 01:06:03,853
We won't need your help.

742
01:06:03,853 --> 01:06:06,645
With the wolves in this,
it's an easy win.

743
01:06:06,645 --> 01:06:08,811
The rest of us,
aren't gonna have enough to do.

744
01:06:09,434 --> 01:06:11,661
Okay, either it's so dangerous
that I have to hide...

745
01:06:11,661 --> 01:06:13,790
Or it's so easy, that you're gonna be
side blind, which is it?

746
01:06:13,790 --> 01:06:16,467
It's dangerous for you.
It's easy for us.

747
01:06:18,306 --> 01:06:20,575
I think it's dangerous
for us to be apart.

748
01:06:21,405 --> 01:06:23,398
How many times
we have to prove that?

749
01:06:24,073 --> 01:06:27,523
I'll be worrying.
You'll be worried.

750
01:06:27,523 --> 01:06:29,797
And we''ll both
feel more horrible.

751
01:06:31,576 --> 01:06:32,662
Okay, you're right.

752
01:06:34,066 --> 01:06:35,437
So, I'm coming with you.

753
01:06:35,437 --> 01:06:37,381
No, we've got
to stay away together.

754
01:06:38,154 --> 01:06:41,061
I can't make you choose
between me and your family, it's...

755
01:06:41,061 --> 01:06:43,714
The only way I can protect you,
is to be with you.

756
01:06:48,251 --> 01:06:50,092
You're not fighting?

757
01:06:50,092 --> 01:06:52,247
What, you pull a muscle
or something?

758
01:06:52,247 --> 01:06:55,208
- He's doing it for me. Okay?
- Whatever.

759
01:06:56,027 --> 01:06:57,423
Just tell me the plan.

760
01:06:58,165 --> 01:07:00,440
This field will give us
an advantage in battle.

761
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,970
We need to lure the newborns
with Bella's scent.

762
01:07:03,830 --> 01:07:05,533
It needs to end here.

763
01:07:05,533 --> 01:07:07,199
Edward and I
are going on a campsite.

764
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:10,150
Even if he carries me,
they'll still pick up our scents.

765
01:07:10,581 --> 01:07:12,703
Your stench, however,
is revolting.

766
01:07:12,703 --> 01:07:14,877
Dude, you really don't want
to start comparing stinks.

767
01:07:14,877 --> 01:07:19,428
What he means, is that your scent
will mask mine if you carry me.

768
01:07:19,428 --> 01:07:20,902
Done.

769
01:07:20,902 --> 01:07:22,465
This is not a good idea.

770
01:07:22,465 --> 01:07:23,643
Edward.

771
01:07:23,643 --> 01:07:27,849
They won't want to get
anywhere near his... odor.

772
01:07:27,849 --> 01:07:29,613
Okay, let's just try it.

773
01:07:32,613 --> 01:07:35,483
- Eau de wolf, comin' up.
- Run.

774
01:07:45,165 --> 01:07:48,037
You gonna ask me
to sit out the fight, too?

775
01:07:48,037 --> 01:07:50,474
Or don't you care
about my safety?

776
01:07:50,474 --> 01:07:53,815
Of course I care,
but you'd say no.

777
01:07:54,408 --> 01:07:56,172
So I won't have a choice
anyways.

778
01:07:57,106 --> 01:07:59,817
Since I let Sam be alpha male.

779
01:07:59,817 --> 01:08:02,026
I got to live with the shots
he calls.

780
01:08:02,624 --> 01:08:04,839
Since you let Sam be alpha?

781
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:09,940
I didn't want to be in a pack,
let alone be it's their leader.

782
01:08:11,596 --> 01:08:13,036
Wow.

783
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:18,110
- Chief Jacob.
- Opted out.

784
01:08:18,110 --> 01:08:21,069
But every choice has
it's consequences.

785
01:08:21,069 --> 01:08:24,093
- Some more than others.
- Don't start.

786
01:08:24,093 --> 01:08:27,028
Everybody makes choices,
you gonna have to accept mine.

787
01:08:27,028 --> 01:08:29,727
You can love more than
one person at a time.

788
01:08:30,573 --> 01:08:34,330
I've seen it,
with Sam, Emily, and Leah.

789
01:08:35,729 --> 01:08:36,813
Well...

790
01:08:36,813 --> 01:08:41,092
- I'm not a wolf, I can't imprint.
- It has nothing to do with imprinting.

791
01:08:41,773 --> 01:08:45,549
It has to do with...
Feeling something for somebody.

792
01:08:46,089 --> 01:08:48,926
And I know
you feel something for me.

793
01:08:49,939 --> 01:08:52,204
I can sense
how I make you feel...

794
01:08:52,204 --> 01:08:53,830
Physically.

795
01:08:54,968 --> 01:08:56,799
I make you nervous.

796
01:09:01,127 --> 01:09:02,567
Jake.

797
01:09:04,370 --> 01:09:05,618
Don't worry.

798
01:09:06,726 --> 01:09:09,345
I promised I wouldn't kiss you
again until you asked.

799
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:13,650
You're going to be keeping
that promise for a while, Chief.

800
01:09:17,349 --> 01:09:21,435
All I picked up was wolf stench.
No Bella.

801
01:09:24,070 --> 01:09:27,338
- This will work.
- Great.

802
01:09:37,021 --> 01:09:39,273
- Okay, Alice. Don't be a stranger.
- Okay.

803
01:09:41,608 --> 01:09:43,748
Your alibi for the battle
is all arranged.

804
01:09:43,748 --> 01:09:45,042
Really?

805
01:09:45,042 --> 01:09:47,737
I told your father that our whole
family's going camping this weekend.

806
01:09:47,737 --> 01:09:50,683
So you and I are having
a sleep over at my house.

807
01:09:51,499 --> 01:09:54,060
- Charlie is going fishing anyway.
- Charlie?

808
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:57,207
You guys run
for the same basis now?

809
01:09:57,207 --> 01:09:59,047
Me, he likes.

810
01:10:00,033 --> 01:10:03,034
Actually, you and Edward will have
the house to yourself tonight.

811
01:10:06,776 --> 01:10:08,586
Like alone?

812
01:10:08,586 --> 01:10:12,148
We're all going hunting,
powering up for the battle.

813
01:10:14,742 --> 01:10:16,375
You're welcome.

814
01:10:18,095 --> 01:10:22,369
- Hey. Do you want a sandwich?
- No, I'm good.

815
01:10:23,878 --> 01:10:26,967
Well, the sister...
I like.

816
01:10:26,967 --> 01:10:30,515
Alice.
Yeah, she's great.

817
01:10:37,765 --> 01:10:40,169
Hey, Dad.
I was wondering...

818
01:10:41,302 --> 01:10:44,817
Why didn't you get remarried,
after Mom?

819
01:10:48,886 --> 01:10:50,237
I don't know...

820
01:10:51,726 --> 01:10:54,155
Guess I still haven't met
the right gal.

821
01:10:56,083 --> 01:10:58,705
- Why?
- I don't know.

822
01:11:01,519 --> 01:11:03,210
I thought you just...

823
01:11:03,210 --> 01:11:05,597
Maybe you gave up
on the whole institution of it.

824
01:11:06,597 --> 01:11:08,259
Of marriage.

825
01:11:09,671 --> 01:11:11,830
But do you think
there's any value in it?

826
01:11:13,707 --> 01:11:15,688
Yeah.

827
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:17,244
Yeah, marriage has value.

828
01:11:18,883 --> 01:11:23,083
When you're older.
Much older.

829
01:11:25,048 --> 01:11:26,900
Like you're mother...

830
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:29,291
It seem to work out fine for her
the second time round.

831
01:11:29,291 --> 01:11:32,653
- Later in life.
- Yeah, I guess.

832
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:35,985
I mean...

833
01:11:35,985 --> 01:11:37,761
You definitely don't wanna
have to get married,

834
01:11:37,761 --> 01:11:41,333
because you weren't...
careful.

835
01:11:43,510 --> 01:11:44,876
What?

836
01:11:45,452 --> 01:11:46,665
Look, you know
what I'm talking about.

837
01:11:46,665 --> 01:11:48,423
There's...

838
01:11:48,423 --> 01:11:50,060
Things, that you need
to think about it, if you...

839
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:51,672
If you gonna be...
physically intimate.

840
01:11:51,672 --> 01:11:54,225
Okay. Don't...
until we've enough of "The Talk".

841
01:11:54,225 --> 01:11:56,185
- Don't you just quit.
- It's just as embarrassing for me,

842
01:11:56,185 --> 01:11:58,368
- as it is for you.
- I doubt that.

843
01:11:58,368 --> 01:12:00,883
And don't bother, 'cause Mom
beat you too early ten years ago.

844
01:12:00,883 --> 01:12:02,843
Well, you didn't have a boyfriend
ten years ago.

845
01:12:02,843 --> 01:12:05,977
I'm sure things work
the same way.

846
01:12:07,778 --> 01:12:09,914
Alright.
So...

847
01:12:11,178 --> 01:12:13,697
You guys are...
taking precautions, and...

848
01:12:13,697 --> 01:12:17,316
Okay, dad. Please just
don't worry about that.

849
01:12:17,794 --> 01:12:21,453
Edward is... old school.

850
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:25,323
Old school, great.

851
01:12:25,323 --> 01:12:26,808
What's that?
Like a code for something?

852
01:12:26,808 --> 01:12:28,681
Oh my god.
Dad...

853
01:12:28,681 --> 01:12:30,467
I'm a virgin!

854
01:12:30,467 --> 01:12:33,159
Okay, go.
Glad we covered that.

855
01:12:33,159 --> 01:12:34,907
Me too.

856
01:12:38,517 --> 01:12:40,173
Virgin...

857
01:12:41,509 --> 01:12:43,875
Liking Edward
a little bit more now.

858
01:12:54,761 --> 01:12:57,065
What are you doing here outside?
What's wrong?

859
01:12:58,201 --> 01:12:59,736
Nothing.

860
01:13:19,261 --> 01:13:21,801
It seems the only fair,
that I'd be represented as well.

861
01:13:26,709 --> 01:13:28,633
It's really pretty.

862
01:13:29,836 --> 01:13:31,327
Thanks.

863
01:13:39,091 --> 01:13:40,450
There's a bed.

864
01:13:41,985 --> 01:13:43,838
I thought you might need one
to sleep in.

865
01:13:47,009 --> 01:13:49,175
I think an air mattress
would've sufficed.

866
01:13:49,652 --> 01:13:52,950
- It is too much?
- No.

867
01:13:53,778 --> 01:13:55,306
No, it's perfect.

868
01:13:57,007 --> 01:13:58,811
I want to ask you something.

869
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:01,282
Anything.

870
01:14:04,646 --> 01:14:06,909
Okay, marriage
is the condition for you,

871
01:14:06,909 --> 01:14:08,894
to change me yourself, right?

872
01:14:10,899 --> 01:14:12,648
Yes.

873
01:14:14,925 --> 01:14:18,516
Okay. I want to negotiate my
own condition.

874
01:14:20,144 --> 01:14:22,855
Anything you want,
It's yours.

875
01:14:24,351 --> 01:14:26,063
Do you promise?

876
01:14:27,502 --> 01:14:28,990
Yeah.

877
01:14:50,349 --> 01:14:54,423
Bella... no.

878
01:14:54,423 --> 01:14:56,557
You've said that you wanted me
to have every human experience.

879
01:14:56,557 --> 01:14:58,915
Not the ones
that support risk killing you.

880
01:14:58,915 --> 01:15:00,504
You won't.

881
01:15:01,863 --> 01:15:03,205
And everyone says,
once I'm changed...

882
01:15:03,205 --> 01:15:05,646
all I'm gonna want is
to slaughter the whole town.

883
01:15:06,129 --> 01:15:08,366
That part doesn't last forever.

884
01:15:08,733 --> 01:15:10,374
I want you.

885
01:15:11,666 --> 01:15:16,706
While I'm still me.
While I still want you this way.

886
01:15:20,688 --> 01:15:22,553
It's too dangerous.

887
01:15:23,232 --> 01:15:26,987
Try...
Just try.

888
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,428
I'll go to some ridiculously
expensive college

889
01:15:30,428 --> 01:15:32,207
and let you buy me a car.

890
01:15:33,085 --> 01:15:35,725
I'll marry you, just try.

891
01:16:16,507 --> 01:16:19,152
Stop trying to take
your clothes off.

892
01:16:19,152 --> 01:16:21,715
- Do you want to do that part?
- Not tonight.

893
01:16:46,042 --> 01:16:48,925
Okay.
I mean, you don't...

894
01:16:50,890 --> 01:16:52,725
But, fine.

895
01:16:55,411 --> 01:16:58,243
Believe me, I want to.

896
01:16:59,961 --> 01:17:02,305
I just want to be married
to you first.

897
01:17:04,894 --> 01:17:08,500
You really make me feel like
I'm some sort of like a villain trying...

898
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:10,948
steal your virtue
or something.

899
01:17:12,828 --> 01:17:15,370
It's not my virtue
I'm concerned about.

900
01:17:17,359 --> 01:17:19,490
Are you kidding?

901
01:17:19,490 --> 01:17:24,190
It's just one rule,
I wanna leave unbroken.

902
01:17:25,918 --> 01:17:29,437
It might be too late for my soul,
but I will protect yours.

903
01:17:30,827 --> 01:17:35,506
- I know it's not a modern notion.
- It's not modern.

904
01:17:35,506 --> 01:17:37,602
It's ancient.

905
01:17:39,716 --> 01:17:41,751
I'm from a different era.

906
01:17:44,147 --> 01:17:48,538
Things were...
a lot less complicated.

907
01:17:50,091 --> 01:17:55,091
And if I met you back then,
I would've courted to you.

908
01:17:56,767 --> 01:17:59,052
We'd have taken
chaperoned strolls,

909
01:17:59,052 --> 01:18:02,410
or had iced tea
on the porch.

910
01:18:12,843 --> 01:18:15,187
I may have stolen
a kiss or two.

911
01:18:16,079 --> 01:18:19,274
But, only...

912
01:18:19,274 --> 01:18:21,870
after asking
your father's permission.

913
01:18:23,486 --> 01:18:25,534
I would've got down
on one knee.

914
01:18:32,025 --> 01:18:34,332
And I would
presented you with a ring.

915
01:18:42,048 --> 01:18:43,522
This was my mother's.

916
01:18:47,402 --> 01:18:52,202
Isabella Swan. I promise
to love you, every moment forever.

917
01:18:53,418 --> 01:18:57,267
And would you do me the extraordinary
honor of marrying me?

918
01:19:03,062 --> 01:19:05,125
Yes.

919
01:19:26,273 --> 01:19:28,231
You're not coming with us?

920
01:19:36,780 --> 01:19:39,511
It will be a last minute decision.

921
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:43,720
I told you how it works.

922
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:47,306
The Cullens have powers.

923
01:19:47,901 --> 01:19:50,963
Don't underestimate them,
Riley.

924
01:19:50,963 --> 01:19:53,337
You'll have the numbers,

925
01:19:53,337 --> 01:19:55,548
but they'll be able to...

926
01:19:55,548 --> 01:19:59,454
anticipate your every move.

927
01:20:00,050 --> 01:20:03,340
- According to your friend.
- Yes.

928
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:06,908
My dead friend.

929
01:20:09,067 --> 01:20:12,358
Laurent found out about
the things they could do,

930
01:20:14,357 --> 01:20:16,206
and they killed him.

931
01:20:17,989 --> 01:20:21,188
But not before he told me.

932
01:20:25,424 --> 01:20:27,286
Maybe he was wrong.

933
01:20:30,228 --> 01:20:32,082
I mean...

934
01:20:32,082 --> 01:20:34,666
This is supposed to be...

935
01:20:34,666 --> 01:20:37,701
Cullen territory.

936
01:20:37,701 --> 01:20:42,100
But we've been tearing it up
and I've never even seen them here.

937
01:20:42,787 --> 01:20:44,963
You don't trust me.

938
01:20:45,815 --> 01:20:48,276
With my life.
I'm just saying that...

939
01:20:48,276 --> 01:20:52,014
I'm doing this for us.
So that we can feed,

940
01:20:52,437 --> 01:20:57,537
without their retaliation.
I can't live in fear anymore,

941
01:20:57,537 --> 01:20:59,192
waiting for them to attack.

942
01:20:59,192 --> 01:21:02,217
I won't let them.

943
01:21:02,217 --> 01:21:07,217
I'm going to
end the Cullen clan.

944
01:21:09,716 --> 01:21:11,588
I swear.

945
01:21:28,458 --> 01:21:32,451
I love you. So much.

946
01:21:52,429 --> 01:21:53,812
You're going overboard.

947
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:57,113
If this is all I can contribute,
I want to be thorough.

948
01:21:57,113 --> 01:21:59,164
The newborns will be frantic.

949
01:22:01,573 --> 01:22:04,454
It's Okay. Don't make yourself
uncomfortable.

950
01:22:05,055 --> 01:22:06,942
It doesn't bother me anymore.

951
01:22:08,572 --> 01:22:10,079
Since when?

952
01:22:10,079 --> 01:22:12,842
Since I spent 24 hours
thinking you were dead.

953
01:22:14,717 --> 01:22:16,329
You're not wearing your ring.

954
01:22:18,591 --> 01:22:20,531
Well, I didn't want to risk
losing it.

955
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:24,849
Or risk Jacob seeing it?

956
01:22:27,546 --> 01:22:31,266
I think we should wait to tell him.
I mean, at least till after the fight.

957
01:22:31,266 --> 01:22:33,921
- If you're having second thoughts...
- I'm not.

958
01:22:34,147 --> 01:22:36,907
I just want him to have
a clear head.

959
01:22:36,907 --> 01:22:38,494
Whose head is unclear?

960
01:22:39,832 --> 01:22:41,485
Nobody's, I hope.

961
01:22:42,553 --> 01:22:44,525
Alice says
there's a storm coming.

962
01:22:44,525 --> 01:22:48,242
Yeah, I can feel it.
We should get going.

963
01:22:49,567 --> 01:22:51,248
I'll see you
in a couple of hours.

964
01:23:01,353 --> 01:23:02,838
Something up?

965
01:23:05,670 --> 01:23:07,444
A bunch of vampires
trying to kill me.

966
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:10,240
Same old, same old.

967
01:24:27,601 --> 01:24:28,921
Thank you.

968
01:24:31,319 --> 01:24:33,248
You should get back
before the storm hits.

969
01:24:33,248 --> 01:24:35,067
No, I'm staying.

970
01:24:35,067 --> 01:24:36,240
You'll need my connection
to the pack,

971
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:37,839
to keep tabs
on what's going on.

972
01:24:37,839 --> 01:24:40,549
- You're not going to fight?
- Seth will spell me in the morning.

973
01:24:41,705 --> 01:24:43,565
He's not happy
about missing the action,

974
01:24:43,565 --> 01:24:45,375
but it'll keep him
out of trouble.

975
01:24:46,481 --> 01:24:48,227
Let's get you inside.

976
01:25:06,252 --> 01:25:08,430
I should have chosen
a site lower down.

977
01:25:08,430 --> 01:25:11,002
No, It's fine. I'm okay.

978
01:25:12,025 --> 01:25:13,267
What can I do?

979
01:25:26,304 --> 01:25:29,393
I can't sleep with all that
teeth chattering going on.

980
01:25:36,917 --> 01:25:38,079
Forget it.

981
01:25:39,361 --> 01:25:44,461
She may need her toes someday.
And let's face it...

982
01:25:44,461 --> 01:25:46,850
I'm hotter than you.

983
01:25:50,796 --> 01:25:54,126
Get your hand off me!

984
01:25:54,126 --> 01:25:56,423
Get your hands off her!

985
01:25:56,423 --> 01:25:58,158
Don't fight.

986
01:26:01,012 --> 01:26:03,417
She gets sick, it's on you.

987
01:26:19,836 --> 01:26:21,580
Why!
you're freezing, Bella

988
01:26:23,215 --> 01:26:26,842
Relax,
You'll warm up soon.

989
01:26:28,172 --> 01:26:30,238
Faster
if you took your clothes off.

990
01:26:31,029 --> 01:26:34,414
- Jake.
- Survival one oh one.

991
01:27:05,175 --> 01:27:08,592
Can you, at least attempt
to control your thoughts?

992
01:27:10,855 --> 01:27:14,220
I really get under that
ice cold skin of yours, don't I?

993
01:27:16,848 --> 01:27:19,012
What?

994
01:27:19,012 --> 01:27:21,300
Are you doubting her feelings
for you?

995
01:27:24,272 --> 01:27:26,269
Nice...

996
01:27:26,269 --> 01:27:29,137
So picking through
my brain's okay,

997
01:27:29,137 --> 01:27:32,317
but letting me into yours,
forget it.

998
01:27:35,915 --> 01:27:36,998
Look...

999
01:27:38,679 --> 01:27:41,564
- I know she's in love with you.
- Oh, good.

1000
01:27:42,064 --> 01:27:44,359
But she's in love with me, too.

1001
01:27:46,679 --> 01:27:48,966
She just won't admit it to herself.

1002
01:27:52,218 --> 01:27:54,031
I can't tell you
if you're right.

1003
01:27:56,113 --> 01:27:58,776
Then let me ask you something.

1004
01:27:58,776 --> 01:28:01,722
- If she chooses me...
- She won't.

1005
01:28:02,052 --> 01:28:03,704
If she did.

1006
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:07,154
Would you try to kill me?

1007
01:28:08,123 --> 01:28:10,217
That's an intriguing idea.

1008
01:28:15,113 --> 01:28:18,818
But no.
I couldn't hurt her like that.

1009
01:28:19,337 --> 01:28:22,938
see, you'd just turn her into
a bloodsucking demon like you.

1010
01:28:22,938 --> 01:28:26,456
I don't want that.
I never wanted that.

1011
01:28:26,456 --> 01:28:28,908
- So stop her.
- I tried.

1012
01:28:30,548 --> 01:28:33,504
- I left.
- But you gave up too quickly.

1013
01:28:35,433 --> 01:28:39,021
If you'd stayed away
another six months,

1014
01:28:39,021 --> 01:28:42,309
I could've made her happy.
Trust me.

1015
01:28:43,762 --> 01:28:46,384
You have to consider...

1016
01:28:46,384 --> 01:28:49,255
that I might be better for her
than you are.

1017
01:28:51,133 --> 01:28:53,376
I have considered that.

1018
01:28:57,029 --> 01:28:58,802
I know you can protect her.

1019
01:29:01,693 --> 01:29:05,235
But you can give her a life,
a human life.

1020
01:29:05,235 --> 01:29:07,204
It's all I want for her.

1021
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,652
But, I'm not...

1022
01:29:11,652 --> 01:29:15,728
I'm not going to force her
into anything, ever again.

1023
01:29:17,490 --> 01:29:20,676
The last time I tried,
it almost killed us both.

1024
01:29:23,309 --> 01:29:25,819
Yeah, that I remember.

1025
01:29:29,949 --> 01:29:32,064
When you thought
she was gone...

1026
01:29:34,554 --> 01:29:36,756
that you'd lost her...

1027
01:29:38,796 --> 01:29:42,318
How did you... cope?

1028
01:29:43,854 --> 01:29:45,794
There're no words.

1029
01:29:51,608 --> 01:29:54,167
But I wouldn't wash it
on anyone, Jacob.

1030
01:29:56,703 --> 01:30:00,937
This might sound odd,
but I'm glad you're here.

1031
01:30:00,937 --> 01:30:02,151
Pretty neat.

1032
01:30:03,433 --> 01:30:06,741
As much as I'd love to kill you,
I'm glad she's warm.

1033
01:30:09,692 --> 01:30:12,347
If we weren't
natural enemies...

1034
01:30:12,347 --> 01:30:16,648
and you weren't trying to steal
my reason for existing...

1035
01:30:16,648 --> 01:30:19,025
I might actually like you.

1036
01:30:19,826 --> 01:30:21,304
Well...

1037
01:30:22,630 --> 01:30:26,457
If you weren't planning on sucking
the life out of the girl I love,

1038
01:30:27,769 --> 01:30:29,506
I might...

1039
01:30:36,259 --> 01:30:39,869
No...
Not even then.

1040
01:30:47,591 --> 01:30:51,289
But she could still
change her mind, you know.

1041
01:30:57,696 --> 01:30:59,594
Then I'd let her go.

1042
01:31:19,077 --> 01:31:20,568
Fine. Hi, Seth.

1043
01:31:24,057 --> 01:31:25,806
Where's Jacob?
Did he already...

1044
01:31:25,806 --> 01:31:27,076
Not yet.

1045
01:31:28,726 --> 01:31:31,351
He's checking to see if the woods
are clear before he goes.

1046
01:31:39,435 --> 01:31:41,865
I'm really sorry
about last night.

1047
01:31:41,865 --> 01:31:43,498
I couldn't have been
easy on you.

1048
01:31:43,498 --> 01:31:46,618
It definitely won't make my list
of top ten favorite evenings.

1049
01:31:47,537 --> 01:31:49,176
You have a list?

1050
01:31:50,024 --> 01:31:51,863
All ten I spent with you.

1051
01:31:52,985 --> 01:31:55,221
Number one is when you said
you'd marry me.

1052
01:31:56,633 --> 01:31:58,437
Mrs. Cullen.

1053
01:32:01,340 --> 01:32:03,341
This is the twenty-first century,

1054
01:32:03,341 --> 01:32:05,341
I always wanna
hyphenate my name.

1055
01:32:06,011 --> 01:32:07,911
You're marrying him?

1056
01:32:08,426 --> 01:32:09,867
Jake...

1057
01:32:13,834 --> 01:32:15,523
You knew he was listening?

1058
01:32:16,364 --> 01:32:18,214
He deserves to know.

1059
01:32:18,758 --> 01:32:20,213
- Jake, stop!
- Bella, let him...

1060
01:32:20,213 --> 01:32:22,274
Don't!

1061
01:32:24,597 --> 01:32:26,300
Jake, stop!

1062
01:32:29,461 --> 01:32:33,715
- Jake, please!
- I'm done! I'm so done!

1063
01:32:34,284 --> 01:32:36,893
- What can I do?
- You can't do anything.

1064
01:32:36,893 --> 01:32:39,627
I can. By going out there
and killing something.

1065
01:32:39,627 --> 01:32:42,893
No! You're not thinking clearly,
don't do that!

1066
01:32:42,893 --> 01:32:45,146
Maybe I'll get my self killed
and make it simple for you.

1067
01:32:45,146 --> 01:32:48,741
No! Just, Jake...
Stay!

1068
01:32:49,565 --> 01:32:51,156
Why?

1069
01:32:52,641 --> 01:32:54,886
Give me one good reason.

1070
01:32:55,603 --> 01:32:57,585
Because I don't wanna lose you.

1071
01:32:59,104 --> 01:33:00,877
It's not good enough.

1072
01:33:01,747 --> 01:33:03,944
Because you're too important.

1073
01:33:07,192 --> 01:33:09,029
Still not good enough.

1074
01:33:09,964 --> 01:33:11,539
Jacob!

1075
01:33:14,847 --> 01:33:16,489
Kiss me!

1076
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:23,784
I'm asking you to kiss me.

1077
01:34:10,613 --> 01:34:13,019
That should have been
our first kiss.

1078
01:34:18,966 --> 01:34:20,866
I gotta go.

1079
01:34:23,269 --> 01:34:25,283
I'll be back.

1080
01:34:54,831 --> 01:34:56,469
You saw.

1081
01:34:57,617 --> 01:35:01,642
No. But Jacob's thoughts
are very loud.

1082
01:35:02,628 --> 01:35:04,198
I don't know what happened.

1083
01:35:06,158 --> 01:35:07,584
You love him.

1084
01:35:12,091 --> 01:35:13,721
I love you more.

1085
01:35:15,548 --> 01:35:17,533
I know.

1086
01:35:31,515 --> 01:35:33,176
It's starting.

1087
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:35,135
Jacob just got there.

1088
01:36:40,891 --> 01:36:42,560
He's good.

1089
01:37:41,194 --> 01:37:42,665
Someone's hurt?

1090
01:37:43,613 --> 01:37:46,982
She's close.
I can hear her thoughts.

1091
01:37:46,982 --> 01:37:48,849
Seth, go.

1092
01:37:53,315 --> 01:37:55,944
She knew we weren't there,
but she caught my scent.

1093
01:37:55,944 --> 01:37:57,759
She knew you'd be with me.

1094
01:37:58,799 --> 01:38:00,499
She found us.

1095
01:38:03,892 --> 01:38:05,791
She's not alone.

1096
01:38:14,699 --> 01:38:17,974
Riley...
Listen to me.

1097
01:38:18,830 --> 01:38:22,012
Victoria's just using you,
to distract me.

1098
01:38:22,610 --> 01:38:24,414
But she knows I'll kill you.

1099
01:38:27,801 --> 01:38:31,279
In fact, she'll be glad she doesn't
have to deal with you anymore.

1100
01:38:32,175 --> 01:38:34,168
Don't listen, Riley.

1101
01:38:34,470 --> 01:38:36,655
I told you
about their mind tricks.

1102
01:38:36,655 --> 01:38:40,979
I can read her mind,
so I know what she thinks of you.

1103
01:38:40,979 --> 01:38:42,717
He's lying.

1104
01:38:42,717 --> 01:38:47,817
She only created you and this army
to avenge her true mate, James.

1105
01:38:48,619 --> 01:38:52,527
It's the only thing
she cares about. Not you.

1106
01:38:54,286 --> 01:38:58,466
There's only you.
You know that.

1107
01:39:00,255 --> 01:39:02,672
Think about it.

1108
01:39:02,672 --> 01:39:07,472
You're from Forks,
you know the area.

1109
01:39:08,038 --> 01:39:10,365
That's the only reason
she chose you.

1110
01:39:11,503 --> 01:39:13,329
She doesn't love you.

1111
01:39:13,879 --> 01:39:16,098
Riley...

1112
01:39:16,098 --> 01:39:19,618
Don't let him do this to us.

1113
01:39:21,251 --> 01:39:23,773
You know I love you.

1114
01:39:36,922 --> 01:39:38,731
You're dead.

1115
01:39:53,077 --> 01:39:55,349
You won't get another chance
like this again.

1116
01:39:59,751 --> 01:40:01,123
You want her!

1117
01:40:02,954 --> 01:40:06,527
You want me to feel the pain
you felt when I killed James.

1118
01:40:08,338 --> 01:40:11,402
When I tore him to pieces.

1119
01:40:13,486 --> 01:40:16,960
When I turned him into ash.

1120
01:40:18,406 --> 01:40:23,223
When I turned him
into nothing.

1121
01:41:42,469 --> 01:41:44,799
Victoria!

1122
01:41:44,799 --> 01:41:49,335
Victoria!

1123
01:42:43,023 --> 01:42:46,841
- Something's wrong.
- Alice needs us to go.

1124
01:42:46,841 --> 01:42:48,267
And now.

1125
01:43:10,882 --> 01:43:13,926
- How long?
- A few minutes. Maybe ten.

1126
01:43:13,926 --> 01:43:15,308
The pack needs to leave.

1127
01:43:15,308 --> 01:43:17,976
The Volturi won't honor a truce
with the werewolves.

1128
01:43:25,075 --> 01:43:26,525
Leah, don't!

1129
01:43:43,399 --> 01:43:44,976
Jacob!

1130
01:43:48,121 --> 01:43:50,892
Jacob. Hold on, Carlisle
is gonna take care of you.

1131
01:43:50,892 --> 01:43:53,296
The bones on the right half
of his body are shattered.

1132
01:43:54,890 --> 01:43:57,320
- Bella.
- Jake, I'm right here.

1133
01:43:59,104 --> 01:44:01,573
- Jacob, you idiot. I had it.
- Leah.

1134
01:44:01,573 --> 01:44:04,396
I need to set the bones before
his accelerated healing kicks in.

1135
01:44:04,396 --> 01:44:06,657
- It's already starting.
- We need to get him out of here.

1136
01:44:06,657 --> 01:44:08,819
We're not gonna win a fight
with the Volturi.

1137
01:44:09,723 --> 01:44:12,596
- We'll take him back to Billy's.
- I'll be there as soon as I can.

1138
01:44:13,066 --> 01:44:14,496
Hang in there, Jake.

1139
01:44:26,262 --> 01:44:27,675
We got you.

1140
01:44:28,562 --> 01:44:30,118
They're coming.

1141
01:44:51,056 --> 01:44:52,464
Impressive.

1142
01:44:52,464 --> 01:44:56,056
I've never seen a coven escape
an assault of this magnitude intact.

1143
01:44:57,056 --> 01:44:58,642
We were lucky.

1144
01:45:00,008 --> 01:45:01,696
I doubt that.

1145
01:45:03,654 --> 01:45:06,468
It appears we missed
an entertaining fight.

1146
01:45:06,468 --> 01:45:10,297
Yes. It's not often
we're rendered unnecessary.

1147
01:45:10,488 --> 01:45:13,346
If you'd arrived a half hour ago,
you would've fulfilled your purpose.

1148
01:45:14,899 --> 01:45:16,738
Pity.

1149
01:45:19,850 --> 01:45:21,649
You missed one.

1150
01:45:28,352 --> 01:45:31,186
We offered her asylum
in exchange for her surrender.

1151
01:45:32,055 --> 01:45:33,951
That wasn't yours to offer.

1152
01:45:37,162 --> 01:45:38,551
Why did you come?

1153
01:45:44,513 --> 01:45:45,960
Who created you?

1154
01:45:47,482 --> 01:45:48,614
You don't need to do that.

1155
01:45:48,614 --> 01:45:50,982
She'll tell you
anything you want to know.

1156
01:45:50,982 --> 01:45:52,389
I know.

1157
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:56,953
I don't know

1158
01:45:56,953 --> 01:45:59,033
Riley wouldn't tell us.

1159
01:45:59,033 --> 01:46:01,330
He said our thoughts
weren't safe.

1160
01:46:01,330 --> 01:46:04,923
Her name was Victoria.
Perhaps you knew her.

1161
01:46:05,556 --> 01:46:09,069
Edward. If the Volturi had
knowledge of Victoria,

1162
01:46:09,069 --> 01:46:10,595
they would've stopped her.

1163
01:46:11,566 --> 01:46:13,333
Isn't that right, Jane?

1164
01:46:15,247 --> 01:46:16,939
Of course.

1165
01:46:18,292 --> 01:46:19,777
Felix.

1166
01:46:20,564 --> 01:46:22,531
She didn't know
what she was doing.

1167
01:46:23,971 --> 01:46:26,466
We'll take responsibility for her.

1168
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:28,946
Give her a chance.

1169
01:46:31,276 --> 01:46:34,137
The Volturi don't give
second chances.

1170
01:46:35,552 --> 01:46:37,747
Keep that in mind.

1171
01:46:37,747 --> 01:46:40,544
Caius will be interested to know
that she's still human.

1172
01:46:41,081 --> 01:46:42,721
The date is set.

1173
01:46:45,458 --> 01:46:47,345
Take care of that, Felix.

1174
01:46:48,333 --> 01:46:50,107
I'd like to go home.

1175
01:47:24,517 --> 01:47:28,172
- It's been going on for a while.
- Doc's rebreaking his bones.

1176
01:47:28,172 --> 01:47:30,099
Why'd he have to butt in?
I could've taken that tick...

1177
01:47:30,099 --> 01:47:32,068
Oh, give it a rest, Leah.

1178
01:47:38,269 --> 01:47:40,416
The worst is over.
He'll be alright.

1179
01:47:41,193 --> 01:47:42,264
I gave him some morphine,

1180
01:47:42,264 --> 01:47:44,634
but his body temperature
will burn it off soon.

1181
01:47:44,634 --> 01:47:46,568
I'll come back
to set up a drip.

1182
01:47:47,472 --> 01:47:48,966
Thank you.

1183
01:47:58,671 --> 01:48:00,579
He's asking for you.

1184
01:48:14,944 --> 01:48:16,757
Hey, Jake.

1185
01:48:19,660 --> 01:48:21,498
Hey.

1186
01:48:33,653 --> 01:48:36,123
I was worried about you.

1187
01:48:36,123 --> 01:48:38,114
You were worried about me?

1188
01:48:39,365 --> 01:48:40,954
Yeah.

1189
01:48:41,960 --> 01:48:44,701
I guessed Edward
would read my thoughts.

1190
01:48:47,404 --> 01:48:49,553
Was he hard on you?

1191
01:48:49,553 --> 01:48:53,547
He wasn't even mad at me.
Or you.

1192
01:48:54,807 --> 01:48:56,607
Well, damn.

1193
01:48:58,780 --> 01:49:00,720
He's better than I thought.

1194
01:49:01,384 --> 01:49:03,404
He's not playing a game.

1195
01:49:05,400 --> 01:49:06,730
Right.

1196
01:49:10,186 --> 01:49:12,166
Bella...

1197
01:49:14,865 --> 01:49:18,120
He's not as perfect
as you think.

1198
01:49:21,085 --> 01:49:23,122
I know who he is.

1199
01:49:27,227 --> 01:49:29,807
I must not talk about that.

1200
01:49:30,804 --> 01:49:34,027
I'd rather get all the rebreaking
done at once.

1201
01:49:39,950 --> 01:49:43,137
At least I know
I did everything I could.

1202
01:49:46,640 --> 01:49:50,146
Wasn't easy making you
admit your feelings for me.

1203
01:49:53,145 --> 01:49:56,467
I only fought them, because I know
they wouldn't change anything.

1204
01:50:04,559 --> 01:50:07,657
I'm exactly right for you,
Bella.

1205
01:50:10,014 --> 01:50:15,014
It would be as easy
as breathing with me.

1206
01:50:20,674 --> 01:50:23,074
You know I love you.

1207
01:50:29,769 --> 01:50:32,895
You know how much
I wish it was enough.

1208
01:50:44,552 --> 01:50:46,007
Should I come back?

1209
01:50:48,775 --> 01:50:51,209
I need some time.

1210
01:50:55,229 --> 01:50:57,908
But I'll always be waiting.

1211
01:51:02,353 --> 01:51:05,368
Untill my heart stops beating.

1212
01:51:07,414 --> 01:51:09,798
Maybe even then.

1213
01:51:31,846 --> 01:51:34,822
- August thirteenth?
- Yeah.

1214
01:51:34,822 --> 01:51:36,819
it's a month
before my birthday.

1215
01:51:36,819 --> 01:51:38,910
I don't need to be
another year older than you.

1216
01:51:40,760 --> 01:51:42,820
Alice said she can get
the wedding together by then.

1217
01:51:43,772 --> 01:51:45,468
I'm sure she can.

1218
01:51:47,680 --> 01:51:49,365
There's no rush.

1219
01:51:51,888 --> 01:51:56,099
I've chosen my life.
I want to start living it.

1220
01:51:56,099 --> 01:51:59,420
And so, you're gonna let Alice
plan the whole thing?

1221
01:51:59,967 --> 01:52:01,244
Yeah.

1222
01:52:01,244 --> 01:52:04,325
Dress, the reception,
the guest list...

1223
01:52:04,325 --> 01:52:07,048
I mean, who knows
who she's gonna invite?

1224
01:52:09,233 --> 01:52:10,754
Does it matter?

1225
01:52:15,324 --> 01:52:17,319
I just don't know
why you're doing this.

1226
01:52:17,389 --> 01:52:20,045
What? The wedding?

1227
01:52:23,697 --> 01:52:26,106
You're trying to make
everyone else happy.

1228
01:52:27,277 --> 01:52:29,712
But you're already
giving away too much.

1229
01:52:30,884 --> 01:52:32,370
You're wrong.

1230
01:52:40,361 --> 01:52:43,917
This wasn't a choice
between you and Jacob.

1231
01:52:47,457 --> 01:52:51,812
It was between who I should be
and who I am.

1232
01:52:55,361 --> 01:52:57,388
I've always felt out of step.

1233
01:52:58,331 --> 01:53:00,801
Like literally,
stumbling through my life.

1234
01:53:03,384 --> 01:53:05,254
I'm never felt normal.

1235
01:53:08,006 --> 01:53:10,068
Because I'm not normal.

1236
01:53:11,230 --> 01:53:13,216
I don't wanna be.

1237
01:53:14,267 --> 01:53:17,585
I've had to face death...

1238
01:53:17,585 --> 01:53:21,561
and loss and pain,
in your world.

1239
01:53:21,561 --> 01:53:24,651
But, I've also never felt
stronger...

1240
01:53:27,551 --> 01:53:30,662
more real, more...
my self.

1241
01:53:32,702 --> 01:53:34,822
Because it's my world, too.

1242
01:53:38,186 --> 01:53:40,503
It's where I belong.

1243
01:53:46,849 --> 01:53:49,368
So, it's not just about me.

1244
01:53:51,148 --> 01:53:55,210
No, sorry.

1245
01:53:56,593 --> 01:53:59,615
I've made a mess trying
to figure all this out, but...

1246
01:54:00,676 --> 01:54:02,346
I wanna do it right.

1247
01:54:03,013 --> 01:54:05,928
And I wanna tie my self
to you,

1248
01:54:05,928 --> 01:54:08,488
in every way
humanly possible.

1249
01:54:11,705 --> 01:54:13,728
Starting with a wedding.

1250
01:54:17,650 --> 01:54:19,910
Actually...

1251
01:54:19,910 --> 01:54:23,419
Something,
a little more difficult first.

1252
01:54:23,419 --> 01:54:25,524
And maybe even dangerous.

1253
01:54:30,634 --> 01:54:32,735
We have to tell Charlie.

1254
01:54:36,199 --> 01:54:38,418
It's highly dangerous.

1255
01:54:38,418 --> 01:54:40,597
It's a good thing
you're bulletproof.

1256
01:54:42,802 --> 01:54:45,084
I'm gonna need that ring.

1257
01:55:02,029 --> 01:55:08,197
