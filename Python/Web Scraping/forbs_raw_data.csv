See full coverage\xa0here."", 'Coal baron Chris Wallin also returns to the list, at No. 41, bucking the trend that saw most mining fortunes fall. While Gina Rinehart retains her position as the country’s richest person, her estimated net worth fell by $1.8 billion, or 10.8%, to $14.8 billion on faltering iron-ore prices. Likewise, her four children, led by eldest daughter Bianca Rinehart, lost $1.9 billion, or 38% of their combined estimated wealth—the biggest drop in both dollar and percentage terms. That pushed them down to the 11th spot, from No. 5.', 'Overall, 22 fortunes fell, partly because of the Australian dollar’s 8.7% drop against the U.S. dollar since the last Australian rich list, in November 2017. Of the 23 fortunes that rose, the biggest gain—in dollar and percentage terms—went to Atlassian founders Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar, up $3 billion each, or 88.2%. Their $6.4 billion fortunes put them in a tie for fifth place, up five spots. Australia’s other tech billionaire, WiseTech Global founder Richard White, jumped 16 places to No.17, after his fortune swelled by $950 million, or 76%, to $2.2 billion.', 'The tech kings are 3 of 35 individual billionaires, one fewer than our last list. Just six women are billionaires, from a total of seven on the entire list, the same as in November 2017.', 'Only one new entrant joined the list this year: financial-services whiz Michael Heine, cofounder of investment platform Netwealth. Since its November 2017 IPO, Netwealth’s share price has more than doubled, placing Heine at No. 50 on the list, with an estimated fortune of $750 million.

Flight Centre founder Graham Turner, property developer Tim Roberts, and Chris Thomas, founder of Adelaide-based meat processor Thomas Foods, fell below the $750 million cutoff.', 'METHODOLOGY', 'The list was compiled using information from the individuals, stock exchanges, analysts, private data bases, government agencies and other sources.

But how about the 25 people jockeying to replace him as president? Forbes dug into the details—examining financial disclosure statements, scouring local real estate records and calculating pension benefits—to figure out the finances of the 2020 candidates. ', 'There were some surprises. Bernie is a millionaire. So is “middle-class Joe” Biden. Elizabeth Warren is richer than both of them, worth an estimated $12 million. But she’s a long way from John Delaney, whose $200 million fortune makes him twice as wealthy as every other Democratic candidate not named Tom Steyer or Michael Bloomberg. ', 'Aside from Trump, Steyer and Bloomberg, the average net worth is $12.9 million—the same as it was for the 2016 contenders. The median net worth is $2 million. The poorest is Pete Buttigieg, who has an estimated $100,000—or about 0.003% of Trump’s fortune. ', 'We reached out to the candidates. No one, not even the Democrats who spend the most time bashing Trump for his financial dealings, answered every question. So we ranked the entire field on transparency, assigning scores ranging from 0 (lips sealed) to 5 (full disclosure). In the end, we uncovered the money, regardless of whether the candidates wanted it out in the open. ', '', '', 'In November, former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg joined a dozen other Democrats aiming to unseat Donald Trump. He has the money to compete, thanks to an 88% stake in financial information company Bloomberg LP, which generates an estimated $10 billion in annual revenue and throws off piles of cash. Bloomberg used $250 million of his own money running for mayor three times, and he has funneled $8 billion into philanthropic and activist causes, including fighting climate change and guns.', '', 'The billionaire-in-chief is rich enough to fund his entire presidential campaign by himself. Not that he will. While donors around the country have been pitching in to support his reelection effort, the richest president in American history has donated exactly $0 of his own, according to the latest filings.', '', 'After years of backing other Democrats, the hedge funder is trying his own luck as a candidate. Money won’t be an issue. Steyer founded Farallon Capital in 1986 and turned it into one of the largest hedge fund firms in the country. He stepped back in 2012 to focus on politics and philanthropy, concentrating his early efforts on protecting the environment. That struck some people as odd, given that he had previously invested in the fossil-fuel industry. Oil tycoon Harold Hamm, a prominent Trump supporter, once called Steyer “the world’s biggest hypocrite.” For his part, Steyer said he had a change of heart and divested his old fossil-fuel holdings. ', '', '', 'Delaney made a fortune in the business world before serving three terms in Congress. The son of a union electrician, he launched HealthCare Financial Partners, a lender to health care businesses, in 1993. One of his major backers: Tom Steyer, whose hedge fund invested $25 million. Delaney took HealthCare Financial Partners public in 1996 and pocketed $30 million when he sold it three years later to Heller Financial (later rolled into GE Capital). He quickly founded a second company, commercial lender CapitalSource, raising $542 million to launch it—$190 million of it from Steyer’s firm.', '', 'The Democratic senator got millions working for Republican megadonor Philip Anschutz. After serving in the Justice Department during the Clinton administration, Bennet left Washington in 1997 to join the Anschutz Investment Company. There, he worked on a deal to merge three movie theater chains into Regal Entertainment Group and ultimately joined its board of directors. Today his assets include hedge fund holdings and Colorado real estate.', '', '', 'Teachers aren’t paid so poorly after all—at least not Harvard professors. Warren and her husband, Bruce Mann, both longtime instructors at the university, have built up a small fortune through years of teaching, writing and consulting. Their largest holdings include TIAA and CREF accounts—available to educators and nonprofit employees—worth more than $4 million. One of their best investments has been their home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, purchased in 1995 for $447,000. It’s now worth an estimated $3 million. ', '', '', '', '“Middle-class Joe” is now solidly upper class. The former vice president and his wife, Jill, earned more than $15 million in the two years after they left the White House, cashing in on a multi-book deal with publisher Flatiron. In 2017, they dropped $2.7 million on a 4,800-square-foot pad in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. The next year, they paid off a mortgage on their other home, in Wilmington, Delaware. ', 'Senator Harris married lawyer Douglas Emhoff in 2014, creating a California power couple. She brought the clout, and he brought the money. Since then, they have raked in $8.2 million—most of it from Emhoff’s work at law firms Venable and DLA Piper. The couple owns homes in Los Angeles, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco, worth a combined $5.8 million before debt.', '', '', 'Sestak graduated second in his class at the U.S. Naval Academy in 1974 and retired as a three-star admiral three decades later. For his service, he gets roughly $120,000 every year for the rest of his life. That pension is worth nearly $1.5 million. Sestak has funneled his salary into a diversified portfolio, which includes more than $15,000 of Apple stock and at least $100,000 in Amazon shares. ', '', 'The former Texas congressman married into a rich family—his wife, Amy, is the daughter of an El Paso real estate tycoon—but only a small chunk of that wealth has trickled down to the couple. Their largest asset is a note held by Amy, worth $2.5 million, according to a campaign spokesperson. Beto holds a minority interest in a $2.5 million El Paso strip mall, which he got from his mother. ', '', 'Elizabeth Warren announces her bid for president on Feb. 9, 2019 in Lawrence, Massachusetts.', '', 'Mayor Bill de Blasio has spent most of his life in public service, but like the Oval Office occupant he hopes to replace, he owes his fortune to timely investments in New York City real estate. In 2000 de Blasio, who held a handful of city and federal jobs before being elected mayor, and his wife bought a 1,200-square-foot row house on a quiet Brooklyn block. Four years later, they picked up a 1,600-square-footer just down the road. Since then, real estate values have skyrocketed. Last year de Blasio collected $108,450 by renting out the two properties while he and his family live in Gracie Mansion, the mayor’s official residence.', '', 'Turns out, the socialist senator is a pretty successful capitalist. After running for president in 2016, Sanders inked three lucrative book deals that have brought him more than $2 million so far, catapulting him into the 1%. Since the 2016 election, he has shelled out $575,000 for a northern Vermont summer home and paid off a 30-year mortgage on his Burlington, Vermont, house—25 years early. ', '', '', 'Since 1988, Inslee has bounced back and forth between the Washington state government (serving as a legislator and now governor) and the federal government (representing Washington’s 4th district, then its 1st district). That’s made him eligible for an estimated $68,000 per year for life in state and federal pensions, an income stream worth around $750,000 in all. He owns a five-bedroom, $1 million home outside Seattle. ', '', '', 'A prosecutor turned politician, Klobuchar holds a plain-vanilla portfolio. Her retirement holdings include a federal pension worth an estimated $560,000, the result of 12 years in the U.S. senate. ', '', 'When the New Jersey senator arrived in Washington in 2013, he owned stock in companies like Netflix, Facebook and Amazon. He sold all of that within a year of taking office, putting the proceeds into checking and savings accounts. Today Booker’s portfolio includes a 2,800-square-foot house in Newark, where he served as mayor from 2006 to 2013, and a New Jersey state pension. His federal tax returns show average annual giving of 11%, higher than any of the other 14 candidates who have released their filings.', '', '', 'The governor of Montana is a small-time landlord. He owns 50% of a historic building in Helena, Montana, where he rents out two commercial spaces and one residential apartment. It’s in a convenient location for Bullock, just a mile down the road from his office at the state capitol. His stake is worth roughly $300,000 after debt. The rest of Bullock’s portfolio is mostly composed of retirement accounts.\xa0\xa0\xa0', '', 'Williamson made millions as a self-help guru and author (with books like the 1992 bestseller A Return To Love), but she hasn’t held onto most of the money. What she does have sits in mutual funds, money market accounts and cash accounts, along with a handful of publicly traded stocks like Apple, Home Depot and VF Corp. While Williamson is not likely to win the election, she’ll almost certainly make money off her campaign: In April, she released her latest book, A Politics of Love.

Those who are carrying a balance on their travel rewards cards should look to pay down debt first so the value of rewards earned can truly be realized.', 'This online survey of 2,000 U.S. adults was commissioned by Forbes Advisor and conducted by market research company OnePoll, in accordance with the Market Research Society’s code of conduct. Data was collected between Feb. 4 and Feb. 7, 2022. The margin of error is +/- 2.2 points with 95% confidence.

For a complete survey methodology, including geographic and demographic sample sizes, contact pr@forberadvisor.com.', 'A credit card can be used to make a purchase of goods or services in-person or online. When you apply for and are approved for a credit card, you’re given a line of credit based on your credit score and other factors like your income.', 'A potential advantage to using a credit card over paying cash or a debit card is that a credit card can function like a short-term loan. By using a credit card, you’ll normally have until the end of the credit card billing period (also known as a “grace period”) to pay back from your bank account what you charged to the card. You can also earn rewards like cash back or travel rewards with some types of cards, along with extras like purchase and travel protections. The downside is that if you don’t pay the entire amount that you charged to your card, you’ll accrue interest on your purchases which can be expensive over time.', 'When you make a purchase on a rewards credit card, you’ll earn a percentage back on your spending as either cash back, points or miles depending on the type of card and what type of rewards it’s offering. Airline credit cards, for example, will typically earn miles, cash back cards will earn you cash back and general purpose rewards cards may earn points that can be used for things like a statement credit or to redeem for travel, merchandise or other options.', 'Some rewards credit cards will earn the same flat rate back on all spending, like a card that earns 2% back on every purchase. Others will have tiered rewards where a certain type of purchase, like gas or groceries, may earn at a higher reward rate then other types of purchases. Before choosing a rewards card it’s important to consider your spending habits and the type of rewards you think you’ll get the most benefit from and then compare that to the various options available to you.', 'Most credit cards calculate interest using the average daily balance method, which means your interest is compounded and accumulates every day, based on your daily rate of interest. In other words, every day your finance charges are based on the balance from the day before.', 'The daily rate of interest is determined by dividing your card’s APR by 365 to find the daily rate of interest and then multiplying that number by your balance. For example, to determine the average daily balance on a card with a $10,000 balance on the first day of the billing cycle and an APR of 17%, you’d divide 17 by 365, which equals a daily rate of 0.0466%. This means the next day, your card would have a balance of $10,4.66, which is what you get when you multiply the balance of $10,000 by 0.000466.', 'Since the average daily balance is compounded, every day the calculation is based on the day before.', 'APR vs. APY vs. Interest', 'APR is a card’s annual percentage rate over the course of a year. A balance of $10,000 with an APR of 17% would accumulate $1,700 in interest. But since most credit cards use an average daily balance method to calculate interest, it can be an incomplete view to look at a card’s APR and try to estimate how much you’d pay in interest.', 'APY is not a term typically applied to credit cards as it refers to the amount of interest you’d earn over the course of a year on things like deposit accounts such as savings accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs).', 'In other words, APR refers to the amount of interest you’d pay on a credit card balance or other line of credit and APY refers to the amount of interest you can earn on a deposit account.', 'In general, there are several steps to applying for a credit card: First, check your credit score through a credit card issuer or by ordering it from one of the three main credit agencies. Once you know where you stand with your credit score, decide which type of card will be the best for you based on what you’re planning to use it for. Credit cards typically fall into one of three categories: rewards, low APR or credit-building.', 'Next, check to see if you’re pre-qualified. Many issuers, including American Express, Bank of America, Capital One, Chase, Citibank, Deserve and Discover will let you check to see if you’re pre-qualified for any of their cards. Keep in mind that pre-qualification doesn’t ensure approval.', 'Choosing the right card may be difficult, but applying for the card you’ve chosen is easy. Most cards can be applied for online, although you can go to the issuing bank and apply in person or call them on the phone. If you’re approved, the next step is to make sure you understand the card’s terms and conditions, listed in the fine print of the cardmember agreement.', 'There are several steps you can take to try to improve your credit score. First, check your credit report to make sure there aren’t any errors that could be having an adverse effect. Paying your bills on time, every time will have the single biggest impact on your score. After payment history, the next biggest factor in your credit score is the amount of debt you have. Since credit reporting agencies don’t have your income information, they use something called “credit utilization” instead of a debt-to-income ratio.', 'Credit utilization is the amount of debt you owe relative to the amount of credit you have. So if you have a balance of $3,000 on a card with a $10,000 limit, you’re using 30% of your credit. Total credit utilization is based on the aggregate amount across all your lines of credit, both what you owe and how much you have available. It’s typically suggested that utilization of 30% or below should be the goal.', 'Credit Cards for Good Credit', 'What is considered a good credit score can vary among lenders, and you typically aren’t told what a particular lender’s exact cutoff point is between a good credit score and a bad one. However FICO, the most widely known credit scoring model, shares some helpful information you can use as a guide. The most common FICO scores feature a scale of 300 to 850. On that scale, a credit score between 670 and 739 is generally considered “good.”', 'You can check out Forbes Advisor’s list of best cards for good credit to see what might work for your particular circumstances.', 'Credit Cards for Fair Credit', 'The definition of a fair credit score varies among lenders, and you typically aren’t told what a particular lender’s exact cutoff point is between a good credit score and a fair one. However FICO, the most widely known credit scoring model, shares some helpful information you can use as a guide. The most common FICO scores feature a scale of 300 to 850. On that scale, a credit score between 580 and 669 is generally considered fair.', 'You can check out Forbes Advisor’s list of best cards for fair credit to see what might be a fit for your particular circumstances', 'Credit Cards for Bad Credit', 'While there’s no exact number that counts as the threshold between “bad” and “good” credit, generally a FICO score below 580 is considered very poor and between 580 and 669 is generally considered fair.', 'The lower your credit score, the more limited your options when it comes to credit cards. Someone with bad credit will typically only be able to get approved for a secured card or a card with higher-than-average interest rates and other additional fees. See Forbes Advisor’s list of best credit cards for bad credit to see what some of the options are if your credit isn’t stellar.', 'There are three credit reporting agencies in the U.S.:', 'Each of these agencies may use a slightly different method of reporting your credit behavior so it’s not uncommon to have a slightly different credit score with each agency. All three companies serve the same function: to analyze your credit behavior to generate a three-digit credit score used to determine your creditworthiness and in turn, the rates you’ll be offered on loans like a credit card or a mortgage.', 'Although all credit cards can be used to make purchases, there are several different types of credit cards, each designed for a different goal.', 'A rewards credit card is one that earns a percentage back on your spending, in the form of cash back, points or miles. The exact amount you’ll earn back can vary greatly by card with some earning the same flat rate back on all of your spending and others offering tiered rewards with certain purchase categories earning elevated rates over other categories.', 'A balance transfer card is one that offers a low or 0% APR for transfers made to the card for an introductory period of time. After that introductory period, the card’s standard variable APR will typically apply. There may be a balance transfer fee to shift debt to a balance transfer card, usually 3% to 5% of the amount being transferred.', 'A low interest credit card is one that has a low ongoing interest rate, typically far lower than the industry average APR on other cards. For those who typically carry a balance on their cards, this may be a more beneficial option since over time, the interest charges will be less than on a card with a higher interest rate. This is different from a card with a 0% APR in that a low interest card’s rate is ongoing and doesn’t expire after a promotional period.', 'A 0% APR credit card is one that offers an introductory 0% interest period on either purchases, balance transfers or both. Think of a 0% APR offer like an interest-free loan with an expiration date. If used responsibly, it can give you a cushion of time to pay off what you owe, without accumulating additional finance charges. But also be aware that the zero-interest period of time doesn’t last forever and when it expires your balance will accrue interest at the card’s standard variable rate.', 'College student credit cards aren’t actually different from other credit cards, they’re just marketed towards college students or others with thin credit files who may otherwise have a challenging time being approved for a credit card.', 'A student credit card, which is a first credit card for many, will typically have more forgiving underwriting standards than a card designed for those with good credit. This means you’re likely to qualify with a lower credit score than the standard version of the card would require. Some college credit cards even offer some perks like rewards and cash bonuses for good grades.', 'When you’re just starting out with credit or you’re seeking to move past credit missteps, there are credit cards aimed at helping you prove responsible payment behavior, and in turn boost your credit profile. The best starter credit card for you will provide a balance between benefits, such as reporting to the credit bureaus and helping to raise your credit score, and costs to carry, including annual fees or any other maintenance costs.', 'A business credit card can be a great way to separate your personal expenses from your work ones, even if it’s just a part-time gig. When you apply for a business credit card, your approval will be based on your personal credit score. It also means you’ll be personally liable for any debts accrued on the card even if they’re from your business and that business fails. The issuer will also take other factors into consideration when reviewing your application, including your business income and credit history.', 'Choosing the right credit card for your particular circumstances should be based on a combination of factors including your credit score, your tolerance for annual fees, what perks you might be seeking and how any rewards fit with your spending habits.', 'Not all credit cards charge an annual fee but many of those that do will offer rich rewards and other perks in return.', 'Depending on your goals in acquiring a new credit card, be aware of any other fees associated with owning a particular card. For example, if you’re looking for a card to shift a balance to, be sure to factor in any balance transfer fees. Those with not-so-great credit may find that some options available to them charge account opening fees or credit limit request fees in addition to any annual fees. Steer clear of those, if possible.', 'For those who think they might carry a balance, even if it’s just occasionally, be aware of the APR on any card you’re considering. Carrying a balance for any length of time on a credit card is expensive and you don’t want to be socked with a ballooning balance over time.', 'If a card offers rewards on your spending, make sure that the areas where it offers the best rewards are a match for your spending habits. Someone without a car is unlikely to benefit from high rewards on gas, for example. While those who rarely dine out or get take-out will likely fare better with a card that offers elevated rewards on groceries rather than dining.', 'Many credit cards offer perks and benefits beyond the ability to earn rewards. Premium travel cards may offer exclusive airport lounge access, free checked baggage and airline incidental credits. Many cards on the market offer other perks like extended warranty protections and other travel protections and insurances. Even cards without an annual fee may offer several money-saving benefits.', 'Cards aimed at helping you shore up your credit profile, like secured cards, work by reporting your on-time payment behavior to the credit bureaus so that over time, your score can improve with a record of positive payment history. There are many cards on the market aimed at those seeking to boost their profile. The best ones charge little to no annual fee and don’t carry account opening or other unnecessary fees. There are some unsecured cards available too, although these tend to be unavailable to those with a recent bankruptcy.', 'Credit cards provide everything from consumer protections to valuable benefits and substantial earnings potential, but only when used correctly. Here’s how to get the most value out of your cards.', 'Earning any type of rewards is better than nothing, but to get the most out of your credit card, you’ll want to ensure you’re earning the most rewards you can on the types of purchases you make most often. Balancing this with a type of rewards you value and are easy to redeem–cash back, miles or points–is also important.', 'Most credit cards come with additional benefits, such as purchase protection, extended warranties, store credits and discounts or travel perks. Whenever you get a new card, or come up on your card’s renewal anniversary, familiarize yourself with its current benefits to make sure you know what benefits you’re entitled to or which ones you may need to enroll for.', 'Credit cards are a convenience but if you’re not making payments toward your balance due, you’re likely racking up hefty fees. Be sure to make minimum payments on time every month to avoid late fees. Ideally, pay off your full balance to avoid interest charges as well.

Others work behind the scenes as the issuing bank for credit cards that may not be part of a traditional financial institution, like Chime or Upgrade.', 'Card networks process the payments between the buyer and the merchant. There are four major credit card networks: Mastercard, Visa, American Express and Discover. American Express and Discover are unique in that they are also card issuing companies in addition to owning a card network.', 'A credit card that’s co-branded is one that’s issued in partnership with a certain retailer or service provider. Popular brands like JetBlue, Hyatt and Disney have all partnered with credit card companies to offer cards that earn rewards in their loyalty programs and offer brand specific perks. Typically a co-branded credit card will offer rewards and or other perks within the brand.', 'Both Visa and Mastercard are payment processing networks and it shouldn’t matter to you as a consumer which one your card is on when it comes to making a payment. But both cards offer perks and benefits specific to their brand and type of card within the brand. For example, a traditional Visa or Visa Platinum card may offer roadside dispatch services and lost card replacement assistance. A Visa Signature card may offer these benefits plus travel insurances and protections. Each individual Visa card will come with different benefits based on the type of Visa and the perks selected by the issuing bank to include.', 'The same holds true for Mastercard: There are different types of Mastercards with varying perks and benefits depending on the type of Mastercard. The most notable feature some Mastercards offer that some Visas don’t is cell phone coverage. You shouldn’t choose a card based on the issuing network however. Instead think of any extras offered by the payment networks as a bonus, with the focus on the main features of the card itself.', 'To view rates and fees for Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express please visit this page.', 'To view rates and fees for The Platinum Card® from American Express please visit this page.', 'The best credit card is the one that rewards your personal spending habits in a way that makes sense for your redemption preferences.

A good credit history over time will save you money as it can help you qualify for lower rates on other types of loans, like mortgages, auto loans or student loans. Since many rewards cards offer tiered rewards in different areas of spending, for someone with a careful strategy of pairing rewards cards, it can be more beneficial than just one card.', 'Disadvantages to Having Multiple Credit Cards', 'Too many credit cards can entice you to overspend and take on more debt than you can handle. And if you’re considering adding more credit cards to your portfolio, keep in mind that every time you apply for a credit card, the issuer will run a credit check to determine whether or not to approve you.

Sometimes there is a balance transfer fee to move debt from one card to another, typically between 3% to 5% of the amount being transferred.', 'This fee will add on to your debt load, so do the math before deciding to transfer your debt to another card. If the amount you’re paying in balance transfer fees is greater than what you’d save on interest by doing the transfer, then it’s probably not a good money move.', 'A 0% balance transfer is when you shift debt to a card offering a promotional 0% interest rate on the amount that you transfer. This can save you money as any payments you make toward the balance on a 0% card will go entirely toward paying down the principal, instead of accruing additional finance charges.', 'These offers are not infinite and typically last anywhere from six months to nearly two years. Once the 0% APR promotional period expires, any remaining balance will be subject to the card’s regular rate of interest. Keep in mind that a 0% balance transfer may not be entirely free as there may be a balance transfer fee.', 'The main goal of a balance transfer is to save money on existing debt. A balance transfer card can save money by allowing you to transfer your debt to a new credit card ideally with a lower rate. Once you’ve transferred the debt, you’ll make payments to the new card. Ideally, you wouldn’t charge anything to your new balance transfer card so you can focus on paying down the balance.', 'Since most (but not all) credit cards come with balance transfer fees, it typically only makes sense to make this move if the new card has a lower interest rate than your existing debt or comes with a low promotional offer on the new card.', 'A balance transfer fee is the amount you’ll be charged to move your debt from one card to another. Typically it’s 3% or 5% of the amount being transferred. Before applying for a balance transfer card it’s important to consider any fees you may have to pay as this will add onto your existing debt. Do the math to make sure you’ll actually end up saving money by doing a balance transfer.', 'It typically takes anywhere from two to seven days for your transfer request to be completed, but it depends on the issuer of the card you’re seeking to transfer a balance to.', 'For example, American Express says it typically takes from five to seven days for a transfer from another bank to be completed but it could take as long as six weeks. Citibank says on its site it can take from two to 21 days and Chase says most transfers are complete within two weeks.', 'The exact time for your transfer will likely depend on both the bank you’re transferring the debt to and the bank you’re transferring the debt from.', 'First, choose the card you want to transfer a balance to. If you’re applying for a new balance transfer card online, you’ll have the option to choose to transfer a balance to the new card during the application process. Otherwise, you can speak to an agent at the issuing bank for your new card to make the transfer.', 'Be sure to read the card’s fine print and understand the terms and conditions of the card you’re transferring a balance to. Things to look for include:', 'Be aware that you won’t actually find out how much of a credit limit you’ll have on the new card until after you apply. This is important because you may not get approved for a line of credit as large as the amount you’re looking to transfer.', 'A 0% balance transfer works the same way as any other balance transfer. After you choose the card with an introductory 0% APR balance transfer offer, you can opt to make the transfer during the application process, or reach out to someone at the issuing bank to shift a balance to the new card.', 'When looking for the right balance transfer card for your circumstances, ideally you’ll search for a balance transfer card with low or no balance transfer fees to minimize the cost when you do a transfer. Keep in mind you’ll also need to choose a card from an issuing bank other than the one you’re looking to transfer debt from since banks won’t let you transfer debt from one of their cards to another. Finally, consider the length of your balance transfer. The longer it is, the more time you’ll have to pay off your debt before interest piles up, but the cards with the longest 0% APR offers may also have higher balance transfer fees.', 'Other considerations include:', 'The process to apply for a balance transfer credit card is similar to applying for any other type of credit card. First, determine which card might be the best fit for your goals. You can then typically apply online or in-person at the issuing bank where applicable. You’ll be required to provide your name, a U.S. address and your Social Security or ITIN number. You may also be asked to provide your income and housing costs. This information, along with a hard credit pull, will factor into how much a credit limit you’ll be granted on a new card.', 'While a balance transfer card can be an appealing option to help pay down debt, it’s important to consider the pros and cons before opening up a new card.', 'There are other options to help you get some breathing room on high-interest debt outside of a balance transfer card. Here are some to consider:', 'If you’re overwhelmed by the amount you need to pay on your monthly credit card bill or you can no longer afford to make the payment at the levels you once did, consider just making the minimum monthly payment to avoid affecting your credit or going into default on your card. It may not help you get out of debt quicker, but it can delay any adverse effects to your overall credit profile.', 'If you aren’t eligible for a balance transfer card or you don’t want to apply for a new line of credit, it may make sense to calculate various repayment scenarios using a credit card payoff calculator. This may help you feel more in control of your financial situation and can help you prioritize your spending.', 'If you’re stuck with high-interest credit card debt, but don’t qualify for a better offer on a balance transfer card, it may make sense to work on improving your credit score. This takes time, but there are tools, like Experian Boost, that may help you nudge your score up enough within a few months that you become eligible for a better offer on a balance transfer card.', 'A personal or debt consolidation loan may be available to you at a lower interest rate than what you’re currently paying on your cards. If a thin or recovering credit profile is keeping you from qualifying for the best offers, you may have a better chance of getting a loan with a cosigner.', 'If you’re looking to pay off one credit balance using another card, this generally isn’t possible. Banks don’t allow you to pay your credit card balance using another credit card. Typically, payments via check, electronic bank transfer or money order are the only acceptable methods of payment.', 'But a balance transfer credit card is the exception to that rule. If you can transfer a balance from a high-interest credit card to one with a 0% APR offer or even a lower ongoing interest rate, you can save money.', 'Once you’ve chosen the card you want to transfer a balance to, you can apply online or via phone call with the bank. During the application process, you’ll have the option to transfer your balance to the new card. If the card you’re transferring a balance to has a balance transfer fee, that will be automatically added to the total balance you’ll owe on the new card.', 'Keep in mind you generally can’t transfer a balance from one card to another card issued by the same bank, and some banks will have limits, regardless of your credit score, of how much you’re allowed to transfer to a new card.', 'A balance transfer APR is the amount of interest you’ll be charged on your debt when you move it to a new card. Some cards offer 0% interest for an introductory period of time, other cards may offer a low ongoing interest rate. The main goal in doing a balance transfer is to save money on interest, so ideally the APR of the card you’re transferring a balance to will be less than the interest rate on your current card.', 'Every new line of credit can ding your score. So if you’re applying for a new balance transfer card, it can have an impact on your credit score. Your score may also be impacted by a balance transfer if the amount you’re transferring to a new card is at or close to the total allowable credit limit on the new card. That’s because your debt-to-available credit ratio makes up a significant role in determining your overall score.', 'But, if you have a plan to use a balance transfer to help you pay down your debt more quickly than you could without doing a transfer, in the long run, your overall debt load will be lower and that will in turn have a positive impact on your credit score.', 'Balance transfer business credit cards function in the same way as personal balance transfer cards. Before making a transfer from one business credit card to another, be sure to consider the terms of the offer, how long any introductory APR offer will last as well as any balance transfer fees you may incur.', 'It’s also important to remember that most business credit cards come with a personal guarantee, which means that your payment behavior, good or bad, can affect your personal credit score. So a late or missed payment on a balance transfer business card will affect your credit standing.', 'Yes, but the limit is determined by the issuing bank and your creditworthiness. For example, Chase caps balance transfers at $15,000. But there’s no guarantee that you’ll get approved for a limit on a new card that high. If you’re only approved for, say, a $5,000 limit on a balance transfer card with any bank, then $5,000 is going to be the maximum amount of debt you can carry on the new card.', 'Also remember that any balance transfer fees will count toward your limit and have to be factored in when doing a transfer. So, if you’re approved for a $5,000 credit limit but there’s a 5% balance transfer fee, you’ll only be able to transfer $4,750, since you’ll have to include a $250 balance transfer fee.', ""\n                Robin Saks Frankel is a credit cards and personal finance writer for Forbes Advisor.

The cards may help smaller businesses including sole proprietorships keep owners’ personal and business expenses separate.', 'It may be tempting to opt for a personal card instead of a business card, especially considering many business cards will require a personal guarantee to receive approval for.

For instance, business cards often offer the ability to issue employee cards and sometimes offer compatibility with Quickbooks or other business-grade accounting software.', 'Keeping expenses separate with a business credit card isn’t only an expediency when it comes to accounting—legal implications complicate the inconvenience of sorting out personal and business spending. “Piercing the corporate veil” is the casual term for mixing business and pleasure from a legal standpoint.

To learn more about the application process, see our guide to applying for credit cards.', 'Choosing the form in which you’d prefer your business credit card rewards involves weighing both how you plan to spend the rewards and several other factors, like the extra benefits the cards offer.

For instance, 1% cash back on a $100 purchase will see the cardholder earn $1 in cash-back rewards. These rewards are usually returned to the cardholder as a statement credit or deposit into an account upon redemption. Cash-back rewards are not a discount on purchases—all purchases must be paid off in full.', 'Every time you make a purchase with your cash-back business card, you’ll earn a percentage back on your spending. The amount you’ll earn will depend on your particular card’s terms. Those earnings are accumulated in your card’s account and you can redeem them according to your card’s protocols. Some cards let you redeem your cash earnings in any amount, at any time, while others require a minimum balance to cash out.', 'The exact way you’ll receive your cash back also varies by card, with some letting you take those rewards as a statement credit against your balance and others also allowing you to take actual cash back.', 'Business credit cards offering cash-back rewards can be, well, rewarding. But these cards also often come with a few disadvantages.', 'Which credit card is right for your business will depend entirely on the priorities and preferences of your business.

The credit card that will earn you the highest cash-back rewards will depend on your business’ spending habits and tolerance for tracking rewards.', 'For example, the Ink Business Preferred® Credit Card earns 3 points per dollar on the first $150,000 spent on travel and select business categories each account anniversary year and 1 point per dollar on all other purchases. If these categories match up with your company’s expenses, the rewards can really add up. But it requires tracking your spending carefully.', 'If you prefer a simple cash-back scheme, a card\xa0that earns the same flat rate on all your business spending could be a better fit.', 'Although business credit cards typically offer higher credit limits than personal cards, if you’re looking for the highest possible limit on a cash-back business credit card, know that the limit you’ll actually receive will depend on your credit profile and the amount of business revenue you claim on your application.', 'If you expect that you’ll occasionally need to spend more on a card than your credit limit, consider a business charge card. With a charge card you’ll have to pay the balance in full every month, unlike a credit card where you can carry a balance. A charge card also doesn’t have a preset spending limit which means you won’t have to worry about being denied for a large purchase. However, the issuer will use your spending patterns to determine an upper limit on the amount you can charge at any one time.', 'Yes. Many cards only offer 1% cash-back reward on all purchases, so a business credit card offering 1.5% cash back on all eligible purchases is likely a solid deal. Though 2% cash-back cards abound and for some businesses higher categorical rewards may be more lucrative, a 1.5% cash-back rate is certainly respectable.', 'Getting a cash-back business credit card is similar to getting any other type of credit card. Once you’ve identified a card that fits your business’ spending habits, you can apply. A business credit isn’t limited to those who work full-time or have a steady established business. It’s possible to get a cash-back business card even if it’s just to use for part-time work, a freelance position or an occasional side gig.', '\xa0', 'Most business credit cards can be applied for online or in some cases over the phone or in-branch if it’s a bank-issued card. If you know how to apply for a personal credit card, the process is similar. You’ll have to provide some basic information including your business’ contact details, annual revenue, industry type and number of employees. You’ll also need your company’s employee identification number (EIN) if you have one and your Social Security number.', '\xa0', 'Be aware that when you apply for a business credit card, you’re personally guaranteeing that you’ll repay the debt, just like you would for a personal credit card.

For a full list of our overall best startup business credit cards, view our list.', 'Business credit is different from personal credit, though personal credit is often used to provide a personal guarantee when a business does not have established credit. Businesses build credit by maintaining healthy credit accounts with lenders that regularly report to business credit reporting agencies. Like with personal credit, paying bills on time is a big factor. To learn more, read our guide to building business credit.', 'A small handful of business credit cards do not require a personal guarantee. These cards likely require some other form of proof your business is a worthy borrower—collateral, strong income or other risk-reducing factors the lender may want to see will likely help your chances of approval.

Those rewards come in a variety of ways. A travel card can earn airline miles, hotel points or flexible points that can be redeemed either with transfer partners or applied towards travel charges.', 'A travel rewards credit card accrues miles or points for each purchase made with the card. Often, these cards have an enticing welcome bonus that typically requires spending a certain amount of money within a specific time period after opening the card. After earning miles or points, there are usually a few redemption options including redeeming for airline tickets, gift cards or statement credits. As a general rule, redeeming miles and points for travel will result in the most value.', 'Credit card points, like Chase Ultimate Rewards or American Express Membership Rewards, are earned for each purchase made with the card. Every card has a different earning structure, so one card may earn high rewards on travel and dining purchases while another may earn more points on groceries and gas spending. Often credit card points will have multiple redemption options, like for cash, travel or gift cards vs. a co-branded card which tends to earn rewards that can only be redeemed for one thing, like travel with a specific airline or hotel or merchandise.', 'Airline and hotel point values often are variable, which means that the worth of a point may fluctuate depending on the specific redemption. Some programs will tie the value of their points or miles to the cash equivalent of a ticket or hotel night, others have a tiered system based on something like peak or off-peak travel times, seat class or hotel category—or a combination of the two.', 'Since airline and hotel rewards are primarily redeemed towards nights or flights, it makes sense to do the research before cashing in a stash of points to make the most of your redemption. Forbes Advisor’s Complete Guide to Redeeming Points and Miles is a good place to start.', 'Not all travel credit cards are alike. Here’s how the various types break down so you can choose which type of travel rewards card is best for your unique circumstances.', 'These types of credit cards earn rewards that can be transferred to other programs, like airline or hotel loyalty programs. Transferable rewards include Chase Ultimate Rewards, American Express Membership Rewards and Citi ThankYou Points.', 'Airline credit cards earn miles that can be used to redeem for future purchases with that airline. You can also use that airline’s miles to book flights on other carriers within the same airline alliance, which may yield greater value for your earnings.', 'Many airline credit cards offer perks beyond earning miles. Usually the higher the annual fee, the more benefits you’ll get. Some common airline credit card extras may include free checked baggage, priority boarding, a TSA PreCheck/Global Entry application fee credit and airport lounge access. If you’re able to max out these extras, the perks can often be worth more than the annual fee.', 'Anyone who stays in hotels at least semi-regularly and who can pledge loyalty to one hotel brand may find that a hotel credit card is right for them. With hotel credit cards, you’ll earn rewards in the hotel’s currency, like Marriott Bonvoy points, Hilton Honors points or World of Hyatt points, which are redeemable towards any eligible hotel property under that brand’s umbrella.', 'Owning a hotel credit card can be a much faster path towards accruing points than earning them on stays alone. Some cards confer automatic elite status upon ownership, which comes with its own set of benefits that can range from late check-out to free breakfast to room upgrades. Some cards will also offer one night free annually every year you renew your card membership as well as other perks such as airport lounge access.', 'Credit card points may often have a fixed-value when redeemed for things like cash or travel where the issuer publishes the cash value per point. For example, a card may offer a value of a penny per point when redeemed for any valid travel purchase.', 'With some cards, fixed-value points currencies can also vary by redemption type. For example, points on a card might be worth 1.5 cents each when redeemed for travel rewards, but only be worth 1 cent each when redeemed for cash back.', 'If you’re traveling for work and you want to keep your business expenses separate from personal, a travel business credit card may be worth considering. Business credit cards for travel function the same as consumer credit cards for travel, although the business versions often offer different earnings rates and perks as well as a different annual fee structure.', 'If you aren’t sure if you should choose a travel credit card or a cash back credit card, it makes sense to examine your goals. If you’re hoping to earn rewards to use towards future travel and/or want some perks to make your journey more comfortable, a travel credit card might fit the bill. But, if you want flexibility in how you use your credit card earnings, cash offers the widest array of options since you can spend your money any way you’d like.', 'A co-branded card generally makes sense if you tend to stay loyal to that brand when you travel. Using a co-branded card can fast-track you towards elite status with a hotel or airline and often comes with other valuable benefits. If you’d prefer to fly any airline you choose and stay at any hotel brand you’d like, a general travel card is likely a better choice for your needs.', 'With travel credit cards, the level of benefits will most likely be associated with the annual fee. A premium card might come with airport lounge access, travel protections including trip cancellation and delay insurance and exclusive privileges at luxury hotels. A mid-range card might still offer auto rental insurance and a Global Entry/TSA Precheck benefit. Even a card with no annual fee might offer some basic benefits depending on the card.', 'A co-branded travel card will offer benefits specific to that brand. For airlines, you might see a checked bag benefit or a rebate on in-flight purchases. For hotels, you might see a status level, a free annual night award or anniversary points. Both types of cards might offer you the ability to spend towards higher levels of status.', 'When comparing travel credit cards, items to consider include:', 'The best way to maximize your rewards is to use a credit card that aligns with your spending patterns. In other words, if a large part of your budget goes towards travel and dining, using a card that offers high rewards in those areas will make the most sense. Another option is to pair credit cards and use different cards in different areas of spending.', 'Understanding how to get the most out of the points and miles you earn from your travel credit card goes hand-in-hand with using the loyalty programs offered by most airlines and hotel brands. It’s free to join and you can belong to as many loyalty programs as you like. Typically when you sign up for a co-branded credit card affiliated with a particular brand, you’ll automatically become a member of the loyalty program if you aren’t already.', 'Tracking your spending allows you to make sure that every time you make a purchase, you’re using the card that will earn you the most rewards. This means knowing which card to use in which scenario based on how a particular merchant codes the purchase.', 'For example if you own two credit cards, one that earns high rewards on dining and one co-branded airline, it might not make sense to use the airline card to pay your restaurant tab since the dining card likely earns more rewards. You can do this by various methods as complicated as creating a spreadsheet or as simple as putting stickers on each card to remind you when to use it.', 'Beyond earning rewards, there are strategies to get the most value when it comes time to redeem your rewards too. When it comes time to cash in your travel rewards, there’s generally two ways to do it. You can plan the itinerary you want, and use your rewards to fully or partially off-set the cost. Or, you can research to see where the rewards you have can be used to get the most bang for your buck. It comes down to how much work you’re comfortable doing.', 'Big bonuses on credit cards look like they’re here to stay. We saw generous offers throughout 2021 and several of the best credit cards in 2022 continue to offer welcome bonuses of 100,000 points or more. While those rewards can often be redeemed in several different ways, travel still reigns supreme: a recent survey showed 29% of respondents would prefer to cash out for free flights or upgrades and another 25% prefer to redeem points for hotel stays.', 'If visions of luxury vacations are enticing you to apply for your next card, be sure to consider what travel points are worth before blindly applying. Our survey showed that 42% of respondents expected travel points to be worth 20 cents or more each. Unless very strategically redeemed, most customers don’t see redemption values that high. Receiving between 0.5 and 2.5 cents per point is more common and should be factored in when evaluating cards.', 'Once you do have a stash of rewards available—either from new cards or old standbys—be sure to use them. Smartly, 72% of survey respondents are using their rewards to help cover the cost of one or more vacations this year (with 12% hoping to fund, or partially fund, at least three trips). Travel is far from the only valid redemption option, so if a trip isn’t in your immediate future, look into other options instead of joining the 4% of respondents hoarding 100,000 points or more.', 'This online survey of 2,000 U.S. adults was commissioned by Forbes Advisor and conducted by market research company OnePoll, in accordance with the Market Research Society’s code of conduct.

Credit cards that offer travel insurance tend to have high annual fees, so keep this in mind when weighing whether or not you are likely to use the feature.', 'There’s no one “best” credit card when it comes to travel rewards—or any type of rewards for that matter. That’s because everyone’s spending patterns are different and someone who travels frequently will fare best with a different travel rewards card than someone who travels maybe once a year.', 'Many credit cards are well suited for international travel. You want to make sure that the card has no foreign transaction fees. It also helps if the card’s points are suitable for the locations where you wish to travel. For instance, if you want to go to Asia, an airline card co-branded with a U.S.-based airline that doesn’t fly to Asia, like Southwest, will not help you.', 'The number of miles you need for a free flight depends on different factors including which airline miles you are using, where you are flying to and from, when you are traveling and other factors. Domestic flights in the U.S. will generally require fewer miles than an international flight. Typically, count on spending between 4,000 and 20,000 miles for a domestic one-way flight in economy.', 'Long-haul international flights can cost quite a bit more. Plan on spending between 20,000 to 30,000 miles each way to fly to Europe and even more for flights to Asia, Africa, and Oceania.', 'Don’t forget to consider the cost of checked bags and fuel surcharges before booking your ticket. Flights booked with rewards are also often subject to government taxes and fees.', 'Point values are as varied as the types of points themselves. Some cards’ points values are more straightforward because some points rates are somewhat tied to the cash prices. However, if a program uses an awards chart the value of the point will vary widely depending on how you are redeeming it. In general, you’ll get the highest value per point on premium airline seats and luxury hotel stays.', 'A travel rewards credit card will typically recommend good to excellent credit in order to qualify. Plan to have a credit score of at least 700 to get approved by the top credit cards on the market. Some of the top travel cards on the market might even require applicants to have a credit score of 720 or higher.', 'Points and miles are effectively the same, they’re just different names for the rewards earned on a particular credit card. Some credit cards offer points, some—particularly airline cards—offer miles. But the fundamental function is the same in that these rewards cards all earn a specified type of award currency based on your spending that can be used in various ways.', '\xa0'," """"\n                Caroline Lupini is the Credit Card and Travel Analyst for Forbes Advisor.

Each category comes with its own advantages and disadvantages.', 'Centralized crypto exchanges (CEX) are managed by one organization. Centralized exchanges make it easy to get started with cryptocurrency trading by allowing users to convert their fiat currency, like dollars, directly into crypto. The vast majority of crypto trading take place on centralized exchanges.', 'Some crypto enthusiasts object to centralized exchanges because they go against the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrency. Even worse in the eyes of some crypto users, the company or organization may require users to follow Know Your Customer (KYC) rules. These require each user to divulge their identity, much as you would when you apply for a bank account, to combat money laundering and fraud.', 'There’s another concern with centralized exchanges: hacking. With a CEX, the exchange holds the crypto traded on its platform—at least in the short term, while trades go through—raising the risk of hackers stealing assets.', 'To address this risk, centralized crypto exchanges have beefed up security over recent years. Among other strategies, they now store most customer assets offline and take out insurance policies to cover crypto losses in the case of hacking.', 'If you like the convenience of a centralized exchange, you can reduce your risk by transferring crypto to a separate, off-exchange hot or cold wallet.', 'Decentralized crypto exchanges (DEX) distribute responsibility for facilitating and verifying crypto trades. Anyone willing to join a DEX network can certify transactions, much like the way cryptocurrency blockchains work. This may help increase accountability and transparency as well as ensure an exchange can keep running, regardless of the state of the company that created it.', 'The trouble is that decentralized exchanges are much less user friendly, not only from an interface standpoint but also in terms of currency conversion. Decentralized exchanges, for instance, don’t always allow users to deposit dollars and exchange them for crypto. This means you either have to already own crypto or use a centralized exchange to get crypto that you then use on a DEX.', 'You’ll also likely be engaging in direct peer-to-peer trades. This means it may take longer for you to find someone looking to buy what you’re selling and, if liquidity is low, you may have to accept concessions on price to buy or sell a low-volume crypto quickly.', 'There are nearly 600 cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide inviting investors to trade bitcoin, ethereum and other digital assets. But costs, quality and safety vary widely. With an emphasis on regulatory compliance, Forbes Digital Assets ranked the top 60 cryptocurrency exchanges in the world.', 'You pay two types of fees when you buy and sell crypto: trading fees and withdrawal fees.', 'Trading fees may be charged as a flat percentage of the amount of crypto you buy or sell, or an exchange may differentiate between orders that are makers and those that are takers, charging a different percentage accordingly.', 'On a basic level, makers are orders that add liquidity to an exchange, meaning they do not fulfill standing orders. Takers, meanwhile, remove liquidity from an exchange by completing orders that are waiting for a trade. Depending on the exchange, maker fees are usually slightly less than taker fees, although this isn’t always the case.', 'While you’re ideally picking an exchange with the lowest costs, dwelling too much on the ins and outs of maker and taker fees can be counterproductive. That’s because you can’t choose whether your order is processed as a maker or a taker. Instead, you’re better served considering overall fees and any discounts available for trading a certain amount each month or holding an exchange’s native cryptocurrency.', 'An important note: Some crypto investment apps claim to charge zero fees, but this isn’t entirely accurate. Instead of charging you an outright, they charge a spread—that’s the difference between the rate at which they buy or sell crypto. Spreads can, and frequently do, wind up being much more expensive than if you paid a percentage trading fee.', 'Many exchanges charge fees to withdraw coins from their platform. This can be an issue if you prefer to move your crypto to a secure third-party wallet or onto another exchange. Withdrawal fees typically vary by cryptocurrency.', 'If you anticipate moving your crypto off of an exchange, you should choose a platform that allows a certain amount of fee-free withdrawals, like Gemini.', 'If you engage in more advanced trading strategies, like margin trading, there are additional fees associated with borrowing money. Beginner-friendly exchanges like Coinbase and Gemini offer quick buy features that charge higher fees. You can avoid them by learning how to buy and sell on an exchange’s trading platform.', 'If you make purchases using a credit card or debit card, you may be charged a premium by both the exchange and your card issuer. That’s why it’s best to buy crypto with cash or wire transfers.', 'Beyond fees, when choosing the best crypto exchange for your needs, consider things like security, trading volumes, educational resources and whether an exchange lists the cryptocurrencies you’re interested in buying.', 'As crypto has grown more popular and valuable, it’s become a big large target for hackers. Leading exchanges like Binance and KuCoin have been hacked, resulting in tens of millions of dollars in losses. While exchanges often reimburse those whose coins are stolen, nobody wants to be in that position in the first place.', 'You can minimize your risk by spreading your crypto purchases across multiple exchanges. Alternatively, make it a habit to move your crypto holdings out of an exchange’s default wallet to your own secure “cold” wallet.

Access to cash value (10% of score): This measure evaluates the liquidity of cash value and a policyholder’s access to it. Some policies will build cash value better in the early years, and with other companies you may be waiting several years before you have meaningful cash value within a policy. Generally speaking, the higher the liquidity, particularly in early policy years, the better—but some insurers charge more for greater liquidity, so consider the possible tradeoff.', '4. Historical performance (25% of score): This measures whether the historical performance of the company’s investments that fuel cash value growth are superior to other companies’ comparable products.', '5.

If you’re traveling outside of the U.S., a plan with travel medical insurance is important because you may have little to no coverage under your U.S. health plan.

If you want the freedom to cancel a trip no matter what, opt for a “cancel for any reason” upgrade. You generally have to buy it within the first few weeks of making your first deposit. Similarly, you can also buy an “interruption for any reason” upgrade that allows you to cut a trip short and return home for any reason.', 'These upgrades are especially good for the traveler who has put down substantial prepaid, non-refundable deposits.', 'A survey by Forbes Advisor found that 50% of adult Americans have had to cancel a trip because of the pandemic.

Rates often vary widely among companies for the exact same coverage, so it’s smart to compare car insurance quotes from multiple insurers. For example, in California, rates for a good driver range from $1,668 (Wawanesa) to $3,940 (The Hartford)—a range of about $2,270 for the exact same driver.', 'If you don’t shop around you won’t know if your rates are on the high end. You can find free quotes online or by working with an auto insurance agent. Independent insurance agents can provide quotes from multiple companies.', 'Insurance quotes are always free.', 'Ask about car insurance discounts when you’re getting car insurance quotes. You can typically knock down your car insurance costs with discounts for:', 'Here are types of car insurance that are generally required by states.', 'Liability insurance: Required in most states. Car liability insurance pays for injuries and property damage you cause to others. A good rule of thumb is to buy enough liability insurance to cover what can be taken from you in a lawsuit.', 'Uninsured motorist coverage (UM): Mandatory in some states and optional in others. Uninsured motorist insurance pays for you and your passengers’ medical bills and other expenses if someone crashes into you and they don’t have any liability insurance. A related coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, helps with you and your passengers’ medical bills when a driver with insufficient coverage causes an accident resulting in injuries.', 'Collision and comprehensive insurance: Required if you have a car loan or lease. These are two separate coverage types often sold together. Collision and comprehensive insurance pay for your vehicle repair bills due to problems such as car accidents, car theft, fires, floods, severe weather, falling objects, vandalism and collisions with animals.', 'Personal injury protection: Required in some states. Some states use a no-fault car insurance system. In these states you’ll make smaller injury claims on your own auto insurance no matter who was to blame. These claims fall under personal injury protection, which is required in no-fault states and available in some others.', 'Sometimes getting the best car insurance means adding extra coverage in order to get more protection or guard against unexpected out-of-pocket expenses. Here are some other auto insurance types to consider.', 'Accident forgiveness. Raising your car insurance rates after you cause an accident is standard operating procedure for car insurance companies. If you get “accident forgiveness” coverage from your insurer, you can escape a rate increase after your first at-fault accident. Some insurers go a step further and also “forgive” a moving violation, such as a speeding ticket.', 'Gap insurance. Do you have a large car loan balance or lease? If your car is totaled, the insurance payout for the vehicle could be much less than your balance. Gap insurance pays the difference.', 'New car replacement. If you’re the unlikely driver who totals your new car, this coverage can help. It will pay to replace your car with a similar new car, rather than compensating you only for the depreciated value of your car. New car replacement coverage rules can vary among insurers for what qualifies as a “new” car so check the details.', 'Pay-per-mile insurance. If you drive very little, pay-per-mile auto insurance could be a good bet for you. Part of your premium hinges on exactly how many miles you drive each month. The other part, called the base rate, doesn’t change from month to month.', 'SR-22 insurance. An SR-22 is definitely not something you want, but you may need an insurer that provides it. Your state could require you to obtain an SR-22 form to prove that you have auto insurance. Your insurance company needs to send this form to the state to verify you have coverage, but not all insurers perform this service. You might end up with an SR-22 requirement if, for example, you rack up a lot of moving violations or you cause an accident while driving uninsured.', 'Usage-based insurance. This type of policy has the potential to reduce your car insurance bill if you’re a really good driver. This typically means no speeding, hard braking, hard cornering and other factors. Usage-based insurance (UBI) programs use either an app or a device that plugs into your car to track your driving habits.', 'But don’t count on savings from usage-based insurance. Less than half (48%) of drivers who opt into a usage-based insurance program actually see savings, according to TransUnion’s 2022 Insurance Trends and Outlook Report. Premiums stayed the same for 30% of drivers using UBI.', 'Vanishing deductibles. If you have a collision or comprehensive insurance claim, your insurance check will be reduced by your deductible. Some auto insurers take the sting out of deductibles by offering a vanishing deductible. Generally this means a set reduction (such as $100) for every year you don’t make a claim.', 'Your car insurance cost will vary depending on several factors that include:', 'If you’re lucky, you’ll have very little experience with collision repairs. That also means you won’t necessarily know if you’re getting superior claims service compared to other insurers.', 'Collision repair professionals have the advantage of dealing with insurers daily and seeing which companies try to cut corners on claims, and which companies have processes that slow down the repair process.', 'For this reason we incorporated grades of insurance companies from collision repair professionals, supplied by CRASH Network.', '“Drivers pay their auto insurance premiums every month, yet they only find out how well that insurer will take care of them when they file a claim—which happens about once a decade for the average driver,” says John Yoswick, editor of CRASH Network, which has a weekly newsletter covering the collision repair and auto insurance market segments.', '“But auto body repair shops see every day which insurance companies prioritize cost-savings by pushing to use the cheapest parts and repair methods, and which insurers take better care of their policyholders by prioritizing repair quality and the use of automaker-recommended repair methods and parts,” he says.', 'CRASH Network produces an annual Insurer Report Card that gives insight into insurers’ claims processes that others don’t see.

If you rely on these programs (or think you might in the future), think twice before refinancing.', 'If refinancing makes sense for your situation, you can start the process immediately. Here’s how to refinance your loans:', '1. Shop around before you apply. Most refinancing lenders allow you to prequalify for a loan. To do so, you’ll enter a few personal details and the lender will complete a soft credit check—which has no impact on your credit score—before showing your estimated fixed and variable interest rates for your desired loan. Do this with several lenders to see who might offer the best deals.', '2. Submit an application. Once you’ve decided which lender you want to work with, submit a formal application. This is a more in-depth form, and you may need to include extra documentation about your income and other details. The lender will then do a hard credit check to confirm your information. If you’re approved, you’ll receive an overview of the final loan terms. Review the documents, and if all looks good, you can sign the paperwork to receive your loan.', '3. Confirm your old loan is closed, then start making payments. Your new lender will likely pay off your old loan directly. However, keep making payments on your old debt until you receive confirmation that it’s been paid off and your account has been closed. Once that happens, you’ll start making regular payments to your new lender on your refinanced loan.', 'Your safest bet is to refinance high-interest private loans. That’s because you won’t lose potentially useful federal repayment options, including up to three years of deferment or forbearance.', '\xa0', 'You do not have to refinance all of your loans, so consider keeping federal loans out of your refinance package.', '\xa0', 'If you do not plan to make use of any federal loan benefits—or you want to refinance so that you can pay off loans very quickly—it’s possible to refinance federal loans. Consider doing so, though, after the Covid-19 monthly payment freeze has ended.', 'Many lenders require a degree in order to refinance, so it’s best to wait until you’ve graduated. Some lenders have more relaxed degree requirements, but they may want to see a history of on-time student loan payments for a period of time first (say, 12 months). You also typically must be out of school before refinancing, with some exceptions.', '\xa0', 'If you don’t yet meet the credit and income requirements but you want to refinance anyway, it’s possible to use a co-signer. Due to the risk to their credit score the co-signer takes on, though, it’s ideal to wait to refinance until you have the financial profile to be eligible as the sole borrower. You can take the time to improve your credit score and refinance later on.', 'Some refinance lenders offer to release the co-signer from a loan after the borrower makes a certain number of payments. That can protect the co-signer from a credit hit as a result of the primary borrower’s negative payment history. If you plan to use co-signer release, check your loan documents to see when it will be possible (in 36 months, for instance) and what additional requirements you might need to meet.', 'There is technically no limit to how many times you can refinance student loans, though after completing the process a few times, it likely won’t be useful anymore. The main reason to refinance debt is to secure a lower interest rate, and at a certain point, you may find you already have the lowest rates possible.', 'The minimum credit score needed to refinance student loans varies by lender, but as a general rule of thumb, you’ll likely need a score of about 650 to qualify. However, to get the best interest rates available, a credit score of roughly 720 or higher is a common benchmark.', '\xa0', 'If your credit is lower, consider waiting to refinance until you can increase your credit score.', 'Some lenders may refinance student loans if you have bad credit, but it’s often not worthwhile. With poor credit or a spotty financial history, you’ll likely only qualify for the highest interest rates. Since most people refinance to get a lower rate, it probably doesn’t make sense to refinance if you have subpar credit.', '\xa0', 'However, you may be able to add a co-signer to your application. If they have excellent credit and a stable income, you could qualify for better rates—even if your own credit score is low. But adding a co-signer comes with it’s own set of risks and rewards, so make sure you understand the pros and cons before using this strategy.', 'Student loan refinancing and consolidation are two similar, but distinctly different, processes. With refinancing, you combine all your old loans into a new debt. The interest rate on the refinanced loan is determined by your creditworthiness, and if you have excellent credit, you could reap significant savings by getting a lower rate. Only private lenders offer refinancing, so your refinanced debt will be a private student loan.', '\xa0', 'Student loan consolidation, however, typically refers to a direct consolidation loan. This is a federal program that allows borrowers to combine multiple federal student loans into one consolidation loan. It remains federal debt, so you keep all the same protections. However, the new interest rate on your consolidated loan is simply a weighted average of your old rates. That means you won’t save money with consolidation.', '\xa0', 'Refinancing and consolidation both have their pros and cons, and the right option for you depends on your financial situation and goals.', '\n']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Finally, we evaluated each provider’s customer support tools, borrower perks and features that simplify the borrowing process—like online applications, prequalification options and mobile apps.', 'Where appropriate, we awarded partial points depending on how well a lender met each criterion.', 'A small business loan is a source of funding business owners can access to cover the costs associated with operation and growth. Like personal loans, business owners can get small business loans through traditional banks and credit unions as well as online lenders—including those backed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). Depending on the type of loan, you can use funds for everything from working capital and equipment acquisition to larger purchases like real estate.', 'Small business loans help companies make large purchases and cover the cost of doing business. Loans generally are issued as a lump sum that can be used to make a specific purchase or manage cash flow and then repaid with interest. However, there are other types of small business loans—like lines of credit, merchant cash advances and invoice financing—that can be used to access cash more quickly and on an as-needed basis.', 'The best loan for a business depends on a number of factors, including its creditworthiness, how much it needs to borrow, what the funds will be used for and how quickly it needs access to loan proceeds.', 'In general, small business loans help businesses access the money they need to operate and grow. However, there are several types of small business loans, and it’s important to find the best fit for your needs.', 'SBA loans are small business loans that are guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, including the SBA 7(a), 504, CAPLines, Export, Microloan and Disaster loan programs. These loans typically range from $30,000 to $5 million and come with low interest rates and extended repayment terms—up to 25 years. That said, qualification requirements are more demanding than for other loans not backed by the government, and the application process typically takes longer.', 'Common types of SBA loans include:', 'Terms loans are a traditional form of financing that’s repaid over a set period of time. In general, short-term loans range from just three to 18 months, whereas long-term business loans may be extended for up to 10 years. While some term loans are designed for specific uses—like financing equipment or inventory—term loans traditionally can be used to fund most large business-related purchases. Business term loans are typically available up to around $500,000, and annual percentage rates (APRs) start around 9%.', 'Unlike a term loan that’s paid out in a lump sum, a business line of credit is a set amount of money that a business owner can access on a revolving basis. This means the borrower can draw against the line of credit for a set period of time—usually up to five years. If the borrower pays back a portion of the line of credit early, they can access it again until the draw period ends.', 'Once the draw period is over, the borrower enters the repayment period and can no longer access the revolving funds. Rather than pay interest on the entire amount, as with a term loan, a business owner who accesses a line of credit is only charged interest for what they actually use.', 'Lines of credit are a good option for businesses that want to access cash on an as-needed basis for things like unexpected expenses and other cash-flow issues. Borrowing limits generally range from $2,000 to $250,000 and come with APRs from 10% to 99%.', 'Invoice factoring is the process of selling a business’ outstanding invoices in exchange for a lump sum cash payment. Invoices are sold to a third-party factoring company at a discount, so you won’t get paid for invoices in full. And, once you sell an invoice to a factoring company, the factoring company assumes responsibility for collections.', 'However, this form of financing can be an effective way to access cash quickly without having to wait the 30 to 90 days customers usually have to pay invoices. For that reason, invoice factoring is a helpful strategy when you need short-term financing or help managing cash flow. In general, invoice financing amounts can extend up to $5 million with APRs between 10% and 79%.', 'Merchant cash advances (MCAs) let business owners access a lump sum of cash by giving the lender—often a merchant services company—a portion of future sales receipts. In contrast to a traditional business loan, a merchant cash advance and related fees are repaid from the business’ individual sales or through automatic clearing house (ACH) payments on a daily or weekly basis.', 'Under this strategy, a business owner borrows a set amount of cash at a factor rate usually between 1.2 and 1.5. To repay the loan, the business must repay the advance with a set percentage of daily credit card sales over an estimated repayment term. A merchant cash advance may be a good option for businesses that experience a high volume of sales and need to access cash quickly—without qualifying for a traditional business loan.', 'Equipment financing is a form of small business loan that helps businesses purchase the equipment and machinery needed to start and maintain operations. This flexible financing can typically be used for everything from office furniture and electronics to manufacturing equipment.', 'Equipment loans are collateralized by the items being purchased, so the size of a loan depends on the value of the equipment and the size of the down payment. However, the best equipment financing companies offer terms and limits of up to 25 years and $1 million or more.', 'Interest rates on equipment financing may be lower than available through other types of financing and typically range from 8% to 30%. As with other small business loans, rates vary by lender and borrower creditworthiness.', 'The business loan application and underwriting process varies by lender, but most banks and lenders follow the same general guidelines. To get a small business loan, expect to follow these general steps:', 'Related:\xa0Business Loan Requirements: How To Get The Financing You Need', 'Just as certain types of loans are more appropriate for certain businesses, some lenders may be better suited to your business than others. Consider these factors to choose a small business loan:', 'Small business loans are available from a variety of traditional banks and credit unions as well as online lenders. However, each lender is limited by its own financial products and lending requirements.', 'Traditional banks and credit unions typically offer a limited range of small business loans, including those backed by the SBA. While traditional banks often have tighter borrowing standards than online lenders, small business owners may still find it easier to qualify at an institution where they have an existing banking relationship.', 'Not only will the bank already have the business’ financial statements on file, but it may also be easier to get approved with a local lender who is familiar with your operation.', 'In general, online lenders may have more flexible borrower qualifications than larger, traditional banks. And, while APRs may be higher through online banks than traditional lenders, approval rates also are higher and borrowers are less likely to need collateral. What’s more, many online lenders provide faster funding speeds than their brick-and-mortar counterparts, making them a good option for businesses that need cash quickly.', 'Find the best business card for you & identify which factors matter for your business ', 'As with personal loans, it’s possible to get a small business loan with bad credit—scores as low as 580. However, you’ll have to demonstrate strong cash flow, and banks are more likely to require collateral to reduce the risk of lending. Small business borrowers with bad credit also qualify for less competitive rates and pay more in interest over the life of the loan. If you have a low credit score—under 580—an alternative option like invoice factoring may be your best bet.', 'There are a number of steps you can take if you’re denied a small business loan. First, try to find out why your application was denied. If your SBA loan application is denied, you’re entitled to a notice of denial that details the reasons; you may receive this directly from the SBA or from your lender.', 'If, instead, you are denied a small business loan through an online lender or other financial institution, contact them to find out why you were not approved. They may be able to provide insight into how to improve your future approval odds.', 'Once you know why your loan application was rejected, take steps to rectify the underlying issues. For example, you may need to improve your credit score, establish more consistent sales or reassess the amount you need to borrow.', 'When applying for a small business loan, expect to provide business bank statements, personal and/or business tax returns, business licenses and permits, proof of business registration and your business’ Employer Identification Number (EIN) or Federal Tax Identification Number (TIN).', 'To obtain financing for your business, you may also have to provide a business plan and copies of financial statements, including a profit and loss statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement. Likewise, expect to furnish information regarding current accounts receivable and accounts payable as well as the specifics of existing debt. Depending on your creditworthiness and the type of loan, you may also need to provide proof of collateral.', '\n                Kiah Treece is a licensed attorney and small business owner with experience in real estate and financing.

Crossovers have taken a big bite out of the sedan market, leading some automakers to pare back their car offerings. Come 2021, the Buick, Ford and Lincoln brands will sell only SUVs, give or take the Mustang.', 'Don’t count sedans out just yet though. There are still lots of buyers—more than 3 million so far this year, according to MotorIntelligence—who prefer cars. Cars are easy to live with: They’re generally quieter, smoother, better handling and more fuel-efficient than their SUV counterparts. Some people just prefer the familiarity of a traditional car.', 'The winnowing of the sedan and hatchback universe means the remaining options must stand out in terms of performance, safety and efficiency. Style also is a huge factor now that over half the market has defected to crossovers and SUV in search of more utility.', 'While Detroit may be throttling back on four-doors, automakers from Asia and Europe are hedging their bets, and in some cases expanding their offerings to cater to these customers.

The automaker is specifically to recapture the sporty image it had in the 1990s and the new TLX offers a more involving but still luxurious driving experience. The regular TLX’s 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine returns 272 horsepower, up 66 horses from the 2020 model. As before TLXs can be had with front or all-wheel drive.

A fresh Z-car is due in 2021, Chevrolet dropped a new Corvette for 2020 and Toyota resurrected the Supra in 2019. That’s because performance cars have a cultural impact far beyond their sales, inspiring legions of fans and helping shift loads of more humble vehicles. Those who do buy are looking for fun, speed and style–perfect for showcasing a manufacturer’s capability.\xa0There are two time-honored approaches to building performance cars: the traditional sports car dedicated to speed and handling and the mainstream model with improved engineering and power upgrades (usually the lower-cost option).

Though cars only make up a quarter of all new vehicle sales, there are some that shouldn’t be completely overlooked by small or growing families. Even those with two or three children may find that sedans offer a more enjoyable driving experience as well as superior fuel economy compared with a hulking SUV.

Honda Sensing suite of advanced driver-assistance safety-tech includes adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist, and more, which helped boost the Accord’s crash-test scores.

The center seat can borrow LATCH anchors from either outboard seat or can use its own upper anchor. Trunk space is decent at 16 cubic-feet. The Fusion earned Good ratings in all crashworthiness categories from IIHS, but received a Poor rating for its headlights and no score for standard front vehicle-to-pedestrian crash prevention. The Fusion’s fuel economy numbers range from 23 to 42 mpg combined from a plug-in hybrid system.

The Passat was heavily revised for 2020, with all-new exterior styling and a much-changed interior (it does still ride on the same platform it has used since 2012). Its back seat is huge, offering 39.1 inches of legroom—almost as much as the generous Honda Accord. Decent headroom and large rear door openings also considerably boost its family-friendly factor. The Passat falls behind in trunk space with only 15.9 cubic-feet. All models are powered by 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine paired to a six-speed automatic transmission that prioritizes a smooth ride and passenger comfort over an involving driving experience.

From there things get progressively wilder, with a quartet of V8 versions offering up to 797 horsepower and an aggressive, widebody look on the top-spec cars. On the negative side, the Charger lacks standard driver-assist tech, and its many options can inflate the price. Fuel economy is a weak spot for the Charger, mostly due to its size and performance-oriented powertrains.

The Maxima has full sets of LATCH anchors for the outboard rear seats and a single center anchor. While rear-facing seats fit without much of an incursion on front-seat legroom, the Maxima’s sloping roof limits the headroom and can make loading car seats difficult. Thanks to a generous list of advanced safety features that are included as standard equipment, the Maxima earned a Top Safety Pick+ designation from the IIHS. Standard features include automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, rear automatic braking, blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning and high beam assist. The Maxima delivers 24 mpg combined from its 3.5-liter V6. Nissan does not currently offer a hybrid option for the Maxima.

Equipped with a pair of motors powering all four wheels, the Taycan comes in four peak output levels: The 4S is rated at 522 horsepower or 563 with the large battery; the Turbo is rated for 670 horsepower and the Turbo S at 750 horsepower. (Porsche reminds us that these peak figures only last for short bursts of 2.5 seconds at a time to protect the drivetrain from overheating.) Additionally, the Taycan is the first EV production car to utilize a two-speed transmission to make the most of its prodigious output. If there is a downside to all this technical brilliance—aside from the use of “turbo” on an electric vehicle— it’s the 69 MPGe rating and 201-mile range of the Taycan Turbo.\xa0Read our review here.

The 2019 Model 3 changed that, combining much of what Telsa has learned into a smaller, less expensive model poised to compete with the influx of mid-priced EVs from established mainstream manufacturers. Featuring familial exterior styling, an all-glass roof and a modern interior it’s unique without being pretentious. 2021 brought some mild styling updates and improved range across the lineup. The base Standard Range Plus model now claims a 263-mile range, while the Long Range Model 3 has a 353-mile range, increases of 13 and 31 respectively. While the fabled $35,000 Model 3 is now firmly in the history books, you can still get a Model 3 for just under $40,000, putting it right in league with its primary competitors. Read our review here.

Projected to launch as a three-car lineup including standard range, long-range and a performance variant, the standard range was binned prematurely due to a “disappointing” 244-mile max range. On the upside, Tesla simultaneously reduced the price of the dual-motor, all-wheel drive Model Y by $3,000 to approximately $51,000. While that’s a significant price jump from the Model 3, its increase in size—ordering a third row is an option—inflict little harm on the range, the Model Y still capable of 316 miles of range on a single charge.

Unlike most current VW products, the ID.4 is rear-wheel drive, although an all-wheel drive version is on the horizon.

For now the ID.4 offers 201 horsepower and can travel an estimated 260 miles on a single charge. While this isn’t the vehicle to take on unpaved backroads, it is ideal for urban adventurers and families who can charge from their home or have a nearby charging station. The ID.4 excels in its ability to blend modern influences with VW’s traditional styling cues, which appeals to faithful devotees of the brand.

A fresh Z-car is due in 2021, Chevrolet dropped a new Corvette for 2020 and Toyota resurrected the Supra in 2019. That’s because performance cars have a cultural impact far beyond their sales, inspiring legions of fans and helping shift loads of more humble vehicles. Those who do buy are looking for fun, speed and style–perfect for showcasing a manufacturer’s capability.\xa0There are two time-honored approaches to building performance cars: the traditional sports car dedicated to speed and handling and the mainstream model with improved engineering and power upgrades (usually the lower-cost option).

192,forbes,https://preferences-mgr.truste.com/?pid=forbes01&amp;aid=forbes_mobile01,,,"['Forbes', 'Take a glance at the personal savings rates by country, and you will see that the United States doesn’t even crack the top 10 among developed countries. While the U.S. savings rate spiked early in the Covid-19 pandemic (when stimulus checks rolled in and it was hard to go out and splurge), it is now falling back to its normal dismal level. ', 'If you’d like to buck that trend and set yourself up early for financial success, here are five powerful—but practical—steps you can take to jump-start your savings.', 'For many young professionals, it’s hard enough to predict what they’ll be having for dinner after work, let alone how much money they will need to retire in 35 or 40 years.', 'Thankfully, you don’t need to know exactly where the ultimate finish line is to set specific short- and medium-term savings goals. Setting highly specific goals and writing them down is a common-sense productivity hack that works—one study, for example, found individuals who write down their goals are 50% more likely to achieve them than those who merely think about them.', 'Forbes', 'Start with the big picture, then get specific about what you need to do to get there. If you’d like to purchase your first home, look at neighborhoods you can see yourself living in and see how much homes you might buy there cost. Now you have a basis for writing down how much money you think you’ll need to save for a down payment. Despite the high cost of housing, it might turn out to be less than you think: According to the National Association of Realtors, the median down payment for buyers under 30 is 6% of the purchase price. Plus, you may be able to get a Federal Housing Administration mortgage with as little as 3.5% down. ', 'You can do this for everything you’d like to save for, and it will serve as the first step for you to create a plan and budget to get there.', '', '', 'When you’re seated in an airplane awaiting takeoff, you’re always told that in case of an emergency you should put your own oxygen mask on before assisting others. Take the same approach when it comes to saving.', 'The way most people save money over a pay cycle is that after their check hits their bank account, they first use it to pay their recurring bills and other expenses. Then, at the end of the month, whatever is left may be saved. That’s akin to putting on your oxygen mask last.', 'Forbes', 'Instead, pay yourself first, by immediately setting money aside for savings as soon as your paycheck hits your bank account. In practice, when you create your monthly budget, you’ll determine how much you can afford to save and set it aside on payday. This simple behavioral shift will ensure that you will consistently hit your monthly saving goal. When money isn’t sitting in your account begging to be spent, you’re less tempted to make unplanned purchases.', '', 'What if there’s not enough room in your monthly budget to set aside for those savings goals? You are the CEO of your money and you need to take charge, crunch the numbers and make some decisions, just as an executive would. The majority of expenses that keep you from setting aside enough money are likely recurring ones—everything from rent, utilities and food to cell phone, internet and cable services. Some of these fixed expenses can take a real effort to cut, but once you do it, the payoff is big. While you’re saving to buy a house or condo, could you be renting a cheaper apartment or even taking on a roommate to cut your costs?', 'Forbes', 'There are smaller recurring expenses where savings, once you find them, can collectively add up. Instead of a big cell carrier, perhaps you can switch to an MVNO—that’s a mobile virtual network operator like Cricket Wireless or Mint Mobile that piggybacks on the big guys’ networks to offer cheaper service. If your cable bill is out of hand, consider joining the millions of cord-cutters who rely on lower-priced streaming services.', 'Now that you’ve freed up more money to save each month, make sure you do so by automating the savings act. From a behavioral standpoint, humans are wired to seek short-term gratification, which is at odds with long-term goals like saving for the future. Plus, you’re busy with your career and the rest of your life.', 'Put bluntly, the less you rely on your daily actions and impulses to save, the more likely you will be to save effectively and consistently. One simple act: Log into your job’s benefits portal and have your paycheck automatically split and deposited into two separate bank accounts—one for saving and one for spending. Another automatic and painless way to accumulate extra savings is to use a round-up app, which rounds up your purchases and then transfers the extra pennies to a savings or investment account. ', 'Forbes', 'You can also leverage automation in other parts of your financial life by setting up automatic payments for your credit cards and other credit-related accounts like car payments and student loans. Missing payments wastes money on late fees and high interest and can negatively impact your credit score—and that, in turn, could leave you stuck paying a higher interest rate and thousands of dollars in extra interest when you do take out a mortgage to buy that house. ', '', 'There’s a good chance, if you work for a medium-sized or large employer, that you’re already contributing some of your salary to a 401(k) or similar plan and that your employer is matching some of your contributions. In fact, you might even be saving for retirement without having thought much about it. That’s because, thanks in part to the work of Nobel Prize-winning behavioral economist Richard Thaler, who pioneered the idea of automating savings, Congress has encouraged—and employers have increasingly adopted—automatic enrollment into 401(k)s. In this system, unless you opt out, you’re signed up to contribute 3% or more of your salary to a pre-tax retirement account which is invested in a default option—usually a target date or lifecycle fund which allocates your money based on your age. That’s not a bad investment option for younger workers saving for retirement.', 'Forbes', 'But even if you’re already participating, it pays to give your 401(k) an annual tune-up, reviewing your investment allocation and fees and your contribution level—and particularly whether you’re contributing enough to capture your full employer match. If you find you’re contributing more than needed to gain that match, consider using some of those extra retirement savings to fund a Roth IRA, which has a number of advantages, particularly for young savers.

And with consumer demand remaining strong throughout the pandemic, prices have surged. ', 'The average new-car transaction crossed the $47,000 mark at the end of 2021, according to industry sources, and rose almost 14% in the one-year period starting in December 2020.', 'Automotive inventories are expected to remain low throughout 2022, which means consumers will have to ignore conventional car-buying wisdom to drive off in the vehicle of their choosing.

', 'The Russian currency crashed 40% in the days after President Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked attack on Ukraine but has mostly bounced back since. A default on the $636 million debt payment and further sanctions tied to alleged Russian atrocities could trigger another nosedive in the ruble’s value.', '“If they can’t get their dollars, either because they’re blocked or Russia won’t pay them, and they are offered rubles and they can get access to them, they’d be smart to take the rubles,” said Jay Newman, a former portfolio manager for Elliott Management who spearheaded the hedge fund’s 15-year battle with the government of Argentina over bond payments. “Rubles at least are worth something.”', 'The U.S. Treasury froze Russian central bank assets held in the U.S. in February after the invasion of Ukraine, but made an exemption for debt payments that was set to expire on May 25.

It’s early March. Vladimir Putin’s mechanized assault on Ukraine has stalled; he’s now making veiled threats about nuclear strikes. From Griffin’s vantage point there’s no mushroom cloud on the horizon, but the prospect is deeply worrying to the financier. ', '“I grew up in a world where we were children of mutually assured destruction,” says Griffin, 53. “It was ‘get under your desk to brace for the impact of a nuclear blast.’ To see us return to the rhetoric of that moment is a huge setback.” ', 'The S&P 500 has fallen 12% year to date. European stocks and the Nasdaq are down nearly 18%. Oil prices are surging. This flurry of bad news is coming hot on the heels of a stellar 2021 for Citadel, a year when the hedge fund gained 26% and Griffin personally earned $2.5 billion. He’s now worth $27.2 billion, but he has bigger things on his mind than the size of his personal fortune. ', '“The continued unfolding of this catastrophe in Ukraine is a giant unforced error by mankind,” he says. In hindsight, maybe it wasn’t a great idea for Ukraine to have taken America’s advice in the 1990s and returned its nuclear weapons to Russia after the Soviet Union’s collapse. With NATO countries reawakening to the existential threat Russia poses, Griffin points to the obvious beneficiaries of rearmament, namely defense and energy stocks—both already trading at elevated levels. ', 'Citadel founder and CEO, Ken Griffin: ""The catastrophe in Ukraine is a giant unforced error.""', 'But that’s short-term thinking. Longer term, Griffin sees a flock of black swans looming. He predicts that the severity and character of the sanctions the West has imposed on Russia will have a long-lasting impact on the dollar-based global financial system. The unprecedented moves by Western powers to shut off Russia’s access to capital markets heralds the weaponization of the dollar, he says. ', 'There will be serious repercussions, with Russia, China and others seeing no option but to diversify away from the greenback. De-dollarization by a China-Russia-Iran-Brazil trading bloc could easily morph into the exclusion of American companies and investors from fast-growing markets. “Have we laid the seeds for the setting of the American era of technological superiority?” Griffin asks. ', 'It’s worth listening to him. Griffin is a big-picture guy whose track record is nearly unparalleled on Wall Street. He’s had only two down years in the past 31, earning his investors an average of 19% per annum. What has driven those returns is his close study of macrotrends and his uniquely powerful position at one of the fulcrums of global finance. ', 'Citadel Securities, Griffin’s other business, is one of America’s largest market makers. When it comes to equities, the firm accounts for more than 25% of all U.S. trades, 40% of retail trades and more than 30% of stock options volume. Griffin employs smart mathematicians and scientists who harness cutting-edge technology—predictive analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence—to analyze huge amounts of data in real time. As a result, Citadel Securities is expanding into new markets and growing more rapidly than Griffin’s hedge fund. ', 'Though it collects a fraction of a penny per share on each trade, Citadel Securities brought in $7 billion in revenue in 2021, and for the first time Griffin agreed to share part of his empire with outsiders, selling a 5% stake to two blue-chip venture capital firms, Sequoia and Paradigm. The investment valued the brokerage at $22 billion, increasing Griffin’s net worth by $5 billion in the process. ', 'The investment by Paradigm, which specializes in crypto, underscores Griffin’s intention to become a leading market maker in the fragmented but fast-growing cryptocurrency trading business. Citadel Securities is run by a Beijing-born data genius named Peng Zhao, 40. Zhao, who has a doctorate in statistics from Berkeley, is well equipped to lead Citadel’s charge into digital asset trading. ', 'In casino terms, Citadel Securities is the house. It doesn’t matter if markets go up or down. As long as people are trading securities, Citadel takes its profit. Its lifeblood is volume, and despite Griffin’s consternation over the consequences of war in Europe, he knows that uncertainty and tumultuous markets will almost surely add to his billions. ', '“The businesses he’s built, my gosh, it’s breathtaking,” says billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones. Adds another billionaire investor who wishes to remain anonymous: “Griffin has reduced the cost, processing and deployment of technology so that it’s very, very hard for others to compete with Citadel.” ', 'Growing up in South Florida in the 1980s, Griffin was drawn to tech from an early age. An honor student at Boca Raton Community High School, he was a computer whiz and president of the math club. He had a part-time job at IBM as a teenager and also started a software business that sold educational programs at a discount to professors. Entrepreneurship was in his blood. His maternal grandparents ran a thriving regional fuel-oil company in Illinois, plus three farms and a seed business. ', 'Griffin says he made his first stock market windfall trading on advice he learned in the pages of Forbes. It was 1987, he was a freshman at Harvard and he had read an article casting doubt on a high-flying new company called Home Shopping Network. He bought put options, betting that the stock would fall, and made a few thousand after it collapsed. He later installed a satellite dish on the roof of his dorm so he could pipe real-time quotes directly into his IBM PC. ', 'There will be serious repercussions to the weaponization of the dollar. “Have we laid the seeds for the setting of the American era of technological superiority?”\xa0 ', 'As an undergrad, Griffin traded options and convertible bonds with $265,000 in capital from his family and friends. His negative bets paid off so well in the aftermath of the market crash of October 1987 that upon his graduation two years later, Frank Meyer, owner of Chicago’s Glenwood Capital, staked him with $1 million. He posted a 70% return in his first year. In 1990, at age 22, with additional backing from Meyer, Griffin launched what would eventually become Citadel Investments, an early “quant shop” with one computer, two employees and $4.6 million in funds. ', 'Citadel’s returns were stellar from the start, averaging 42% in his first two full years trading. By the time Griffin was 30, in 1998, Citadel’s hedge funds had $1 billion in assets. In 2002 he created Citadel Securities partly because he was miffed that the broker-dealers handling his options trades were charging stiff commissions. In 2003, at 34, Griffin debuted on The Forbes 400 as that year’s youngest self-made member, with a net worth of $650 million. ', 'Over the years, he has made opportunistic acquisitions. In 2002 he picked up pieces of Enron’s energy trading arm, and four years later he snapped up Amaranth Advisors and Sowood Capital after they suffered devastating trading losses. It hasn’t all been a smooth ride, however. The 2008 financial crisis hit Citadel’s flagship fund with 50% losses, bringing the firm dangerously close to failing. He called his move to halt redemptions “one of the most difficult decisions I ever made.” The next year he recovered, up 62%. ', 'Ask him for the key to his success and he’ll talk about his obsession with talent. He reckons he has personally interviewed no fewer than 10,000 candidates—roughly two per day—over his career. In just the last three years, Citadel has hired more than 400 engineers, some fresh out of elite colleges but others from competing Wall Street firms and big tech. ', 'Last November Griffin beat out a 17,000-member crypto collective by paying $43 million for a first printing of the U.S. Constitution. The impetus for the purchase was reportedly from his son: “Dad, you have to buy the Constitution!”', 'Citadel has an intense “sink or swim” culture. “My reputation at Goldman was that I was a little too detail oriented . . . managing too closely some of the people,” says Pablo Salame, Citadel’s co–chief investment officer, who was Goldman Sachs’ vice chairman before joining the hedge fund in 2019. “Then I realized I’ve been way too big-picture. Being in the weeds—Ken redefined it for me.” ', 'Griffin has spent most of his career avoiding publicity. But last year, Citadel Securities’ close relationship with commission-free brokerage firm Robinhood unleashed a storm of unwanted attention. In a practice known as “payment for order flow,” Citadel pays Robinhood for millions of buy and sell orders each day, then uses its massive computer power to match the trades in a way that earns it virtually risk-free profit. The practice is legal—and it’s how Robinhood can afford to offer commission-free trades—but many consider it unsavory. ', 'In February 2021 Griffin was hauled before Congress to testify in hearings concerning a halt in trading in GameStop, the poster child for the “meme stock” frenzy roiling Wall Street at the time. An army of unsophisticated traders, mostly from Robinhood, were bidding the past-its-prime video game retailer to unprecedented heights and, in the process, catching some pros with their pants down. New York City–based hedge fund Melvin Capital was caught in a short squeeze and nearly forced to liquidate. Griffin’s hedge fund and Steven A. Cohen’s Point72 saved Melvin with a $2.75 billion emergency investment. ', 'A few days later, Robinhood made it impossible for its customers to buy meme stock shares, which in addition to GameStop included struggling movie theater chain AMC and big box retailer Bed Bath & Beyond. The price of GameStop plummeted, effectively throwing Melvin another lifeline. After investors filed numerous lawsuits and the SEC launched an investigation, Griffin told Congress under oath that he had no communication with Robinhood. Citadel and Robinhood were cleared of conspiracy charges, but Griffin became the subject of relentless ridicule in memes on Reddit and Twitter. ', '“The vilification of payment for order flow might score political points. But what a disgrace if it detracts from retail investor confidence in the stock market and the allocation of capital to companies that create jobs,” Griffin says. “When I was in college, trading commissions were $19 or $20. Today they’re free. I mean, the amount of value that we have shifted to retail investors has been stunning—and my firm has been one of the biggest drivers of that phenomenon.” ', 'During the pandemic, Griffin donated more than $50 million to vaccine development and other Covid-19-related programs. Like some other Wall Streeters, he set up operations in Florida, with a makeshift trading floor for 50 key staffers and their families at the Four Seasons in Palm Beach—near the 20 oceanfront acres he has accumulated half a mile from Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago. ', 'In June 2021, Griffin ordered most of his 4,000 employees back to work. “One of the biggest drivers of our success was our decision to return to the office,” he says, contending that in-office work shows respect to his fund’s clients. “There’s no doubt that the collaboration amongst my colleagues in person accentuates our ability to act and react to information in a way that a number of our competitors just can’t.” ', 'The war in Ukraine has pushed aside pandemic and meme stock woes. Like any great trader, Griffin is focused on domino effects. In other words, he’s interested in how the reaction to one disaster reduces the number of good options available for dealing with the next one. He bemoans America’s economic response to the pandemic—essentially flooding the zone with $5 trillion in federal stimulus spending. “It has put a great burden on our fiscal deficit and locked in a huge liability for the next generation. As fiscal spending fades away, what will be the intrinsic economic growth that we’re going to experience?” ', 'Stimulus also contributed to inflation, currently running at 8%. “In our adult life, we’ve never really experienced inflation,” Griffin says. “We don’t think about having to negotiate multi-year wage deals with locked-in wage increases.” ', 'Griffin believes inflation is going to force central banks around the world to tighten interest rates more aggressively. That doesn’t bode well for Europe, where a record price spike for electricity and natural gas (to more than 10 times U.S. prices) is already hampering the production of things like chemicals and gas-derived fertilizer. ', 'Perhaps the biggest risk, Griffin says, is the weaponization of the dollar now that Western powers have cut off Russia’s access to bank accounts containing hundreds of billions of dollars in cash and securities. ', '“Putin refers to it as an act of war,” he says. “Our nation has a huge debt to finance. And if we see key buyers around the world back away from owning Treasuries and other dollar assets, we will pay a much higher cost on that debt for years to come. It will take away from our ability to provide a social safety net, our ability to invest in research and development and to invest in education or infrastructure.” ', 'It’s already happening. In late March Russia demanded that Japanese fuel buyers pay in rubles. How long before China is paying in yuan instead of dollars? “Nations won’t want to depend upon the good graces of America.” ', 'That’s just the first-order effect. He thinks it will get worse. “There’s nothing like the need to drive innovation.” Denying rival nations like Russia and China access to American technology will simply lead them to find other solutions. “Creating independence from the U.S. on high-end technology has become an existential issue, because they cannot rely on us.” ', 'It’s baffling to Griffin that America, with plentiful natural resources, is not self-sufficient in oil. “This is a form of inflation self-imposed by our policy decisions in Washington,” he says. “We are blessed to have such deep reservoirs of energy in America—the combination of fossil fuels, oil, natural gas and the [large size] of our country to avail ourselves of solar and wind. It is completely unacceptable for our country, with all our technological and geological advantages, to depend on any other country for energy.” ', 'Despite the dark clouds, Griffin doesn’t think investors should be freaked out by the surge in commodity prices. He has faith that those price spikes will ultimately resolve themselves. Consider natural gas, which just 15 years ago was expensive and in short supply. Then came the fracking revolution, and now American gas is so cheap and plentiful that the U.S. exports 7 billion cubic feet of it per day to Europe, displacing Russian gas. ', 'Griffin points out that “commodities typically have become dramatically cheaper over the course of history as we have found solutions to either secure them at a lower price or find a lower-cost solution.” ', 'The best long-term bets, he says, are innovative, fast-growing American tech companies “on the forefront of revolutionizing how corporate America functions.” ', 'As for bitcoin, Griffin the investor is still a skeptic. “There’s nothing efficient about bitcoin from an economic or environmental perspective. I don’t see bitcoin as a payment solution,” he says. “I personally haven’t seen the attraction of owning cryptocurrencies as a store of value. But you know, there are assets I own that people would make the same arguments about. I’m a collector of American abstract art.” ', 'But Griffin the shrewd business strategist can’t resist training his genius quants at Citadel Securities, with their market-dominating algorithms, on the $2 trillion market for trading cryptocurrencies. After all, if making money off Robinhood traders has been easy, profiting from rubes who have given Dogecoin a market cap of $20 billion should be a snap. ', 'Griffin has already bested the crypto crowd with his recent $43 million purchase of a first printing of the U.S. Constitution. His most serious rival in the November 2021 Sotheby’s auction was a blockchain-backed digital money collective—a “decentralized autonomous organization” known as ConstitutionDAO, which had raised tens of millions in an attempt to buy the document. ', 'After Griffin secured the prize, he contacted members of the DAO. “We reached out about ideas like shared governance for a period of time, or allowing them to create a [Constitution] NFT for the DAO contributors,” he says. “But they couldn’t make a decision.” Instead, he will lend the document to billionaire Alice Walton’s Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas, to be put on display there. ', '“You need hierarchy, you need leadership structure, you need clear decision making and clear lines of authority,” Griffin says. “The culture of participation trophies is not going to create the leaders we need to run our country in business or politics.” ', '', '', '']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He bought put options, betting that the stock would fall, and made a few thousand after it collapsed. He later installed a satellite dish on the roof of his dorm so he could pipe real-time quotes directly into his IBM PC. ', 'There will be serious repercussions to the weaponization of the dollar. “Have we laid the seeds for the setting of the American era of technological superiority?”\xa0 ', 'As an undergrad, Griffin traded options and convertible bonds with $265,000 in capital from his family and friends. His negative bets paid off so well in the aftermath of the market crash of October 1987 that upon his graduation two years later, Frank Meyer, owner of Chicago’s Glenwood Capital, staked him with $1 million. He posted a 70% return in his first year. In 1990, at age 22, with additional backing from Meyer, Griffin launched what would eventually become Citadel Investments, an early “quant shop” with one computer, two employees and $4.6 million in funds. ', 'Citadel’s returns were stellar from the start, averaging 42% in his first two full years trading. By the time Griffin was 30, in 1998, Citadel’s hedge funds had $1 billion in assets. In 2002 he created Citadel Securities partly because he was miffed that the broker-dealers handling his options trades were charging stiff commissions. In 2003, at 34, Griffin debuted on The Forbes 400 as that year’s youngest self-made member, with a net worth of $650 million. ', 'Over the years, he has made opportunistic acquisitions. In 2002 he picked up pieces of Enron’s energy trading arm, and four years later he snapped up Amaranth Advisors and Sowood Capital after they suffered devastating trading losses. It hasn’t all been a smooth ride, however. The 2008 financial crisis hit Citadel’s flagship fund with 50% losses, bringing the firm dangerously close to failing. He called his move to halt redemptions “one of the most difficult decisions I ever made.” The next year he recovered, up 62%. ', 'Ask him for the key to his success and he’ll talk about his obsession with talent. He reckons he has personally interviewed no fewer than 10,000 candidates—roughly two per day—over his career. In just the last three years, Citadel has hired more than 400 engineers, some fresh out of elite colleges but others from competing Wall Street firms and big tech. ', 'Last November Griffin beat out a 17,000-member crypto collective by paying $43 million for a first printing of the U.S. Constitution. The impetus for the purchase was reportedly from his son: “Dad, you have to buy the Constitution!”', 'Citadel has an intense “sink or swim” culture. “My reputation at Goldman was that I was a little too detail oriented . . . managing too closely some of the people,” says Pablo Salame, Citadel’s co–chief investment officer, who was Goldman Sachs’ vice chairman before joining the hedge fund in 2019. “Then I realized I’ve been way too big-picture. Being in the weeds—Ken redefined it for me.” ', 'Griffin has spent most of his career avoiding publicity. But last year, Citadel Securities’ close relationship with commission-free brokerage firm Robinhood unleashed a storm of unwanted attention. In a practice known as “payment for order flow,” Citadel pays Robinhood for millions of buy and sell orders each day, then uses its massive computer power to match the trades in a way that earns it virtually risk-free profit. The practice is legal—and it’s how Robinhood can afford to offer commission-free trades—but many consider it unsavory. ', 'In February 2021 Griffin was hauled before Congress to testify in hearings concerning a halt in trading in GameStop, the poster child for the “meme stock” frenzy roiling Wall Street at the time. An army of unsophisticated traders, mostly from Robinhood, were bidding the past-its-prime video game retailer to unprecedented heights and, in the process, catching some pros with their pants down. New York City–based hedge fund Melvin Capital was caught in a short squeeze and nearly forced to liquidate. Griffin’s hedge fund and Steven A. Cohen’s Point72 saved Melvin with a $2.75 billion emergency investment. ', 'A few days later, Robinhood made it impossible for its customers to buy meme stock shares, which in addition to GameStop included struggling movie theater chain AMC and big box retailer Bed Bath & Beyond. The price of GameStop plummeted, effectively throwing Melvin another lifeline. After investors filed numerous lawsuits and the SEC launched an investigation, Griffin told Congress under oath that he had no communication with Robinhood. Citadel and Robinhood were cleared of conspiracy charges, but Griffin became the subject of relentless ridicule in memes on Reddit and Twitter. ', '“The vilification of payment for order flow might score political points. But what a disgrace if it detracts from retail investor confidence in the stock market and the allocation of capital to companies that create jobs,” Griffin says. “When I was in college, trading commissions were $19 or $20. Today they’re free. I mean, the amount of value that we have shifted to retail investors has been stunning—and my firm has been one of the biggest drivers of that phenomenon.” ', 'During the pandemic, Griffin donated more than $50 million to vaccine development and other Covid-19-related programs. Like some other Wall Streeters, he set up operations in Florida, with a makeshift trading floor for 50 key staffers and their families at the Four Seasons in Palm Beach—near the 20 oceanfront acres he has accumulated half a mile from Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago. ', 'In June 2021, Griffin ordered most of his 4,000 employees back to work. “One of the biggest drivers of our success was our decision to return to the office,” he says, contending that in-office work shows respect to his fund’s clients. “There’s no doubt that the collaboration amongst my colleagues in person accentuates our ability to act and react to information in a way that a number of our competitors just can’t.” ', 'The war in Ukraine has pushed aside pandemic and meme stock woes. Like any great trader, Griffin is focused on domino effects. In other words, he’s interested in how the reaction to one disaster reduces the number of good options available for dealing with the next one. He bemoans America’s economic response to the pandemic—essentially flooding the zone with $5 trillion in federal stimulus spending. “It has put a great burden on our fiscal deficit and locked in a huge liability for the next generation. As fiscal spending fades away, what will be the intrinsic economic growth that we’re going to experience?” ', 'Stimulus also contributed to inflation, currently running at 8%. “In our adult life, we’ve never really experienced inflation,” Griffin says. “We don’t think about having to negotiate multi-year wage deals with locked-in wage increases.” ', 'Griffin believes inflation is going to force central banks around the world to tighten interest rates more aggressively. That doesn’t bode well for Europe, where a record price spike for electricity and natural gas (to more than 10 times U.S. prices) is already hampering the production of things like chemicals and gas-derived fertilizer. ', 'Perhaps the biggest risk, Griffin says, is the weaponization of the dollar now that Western powers have cut off Russia’s access to bank accounts containing hundreds of billions of dollars in cash and securities. ', '“Putin refers to it as an act of war,” he says. “Our nation has a huge debt to finance. And if we see key buyers around the world back away from owning Treasuries and other dollar assets, we will pay a much higher cost on that debt for years to come. It will take away from our ability to provide a social safety net, our ability to invest in research and development and to invest in education or infrastructure.” ', 'It’s already happening. In late March Russia demanded that Japanese fuel buyers pay in rubles. How long before China is paying in yuan instead of dollars? “Nations won’t want to depend upon the good graces of America.” ', 'That’s just the first-order effect. He thinks it will get worse. “There’s nothing like the need to drive innovation.” Denying rival nations like Russia and China access to American technology will simply lead them to find other solutions. “Creating independence from the U.S. on high-end technology has become an existential issue, because they cannot rely on us.” ', 'It’s baffling to Griffin that America, with plentiful natural resources, is not self-sufficient in oil. “This is a form of inflation self-imposed by our policy decisions in Washington,” he says. “We are blessed to have such deep reservoirs of energy in America—the combination of fossil fuels, oil, natural gas and the [large size] of our country to avail ourselves of solar and wind. It is completely unacceptable for our country, with all our technological and geological advantages, to depend on any other country for energy.” ', 'Despite the dark clouds, Griffin doesn’t think investors should be freaked out by the surge in commodity prices. He has faith that those price spikes will ultimately resolve themselves. Consider natural gas, which just 15 years ago was expensive and in short supply. Then came the fracking revolution, and now American gas is so cheap and plentiful that the U.S. exports 7 billion cubic feet of it per day to Europe, displacing Russian gas. ', 'Griffin points out that “commodities typically have become dramatically cheaper over the course of history as we have found solutions to either secure them at a lower price or find a lower-cost solution.” ', 'The best long-term bets, he says, are innovative, fast-growing American tech companies “on the forefront of revolutionizing how corporate America functions.” ', 'As for bitcoin, Griffin the investor is still a skeptic. “There’s nothing efficient about bitcoin from an economic or environmental perspective. I don’t see bitcoin as a payment solution,” he says. “I personally haven’t seen the attraction of owning cryptocurrencies as a store of value. But you know, there are assets I own that people would make the same arguments about. I’m a collector of American abstract art.” ', 'But Griffin the shrewd business strategist can’t resist training his genius quants at Citadel Securities, with their market-dominating algorithms, on the $2 trillion market for trading cryptocurrencies. After all, if making money off Robinhood traders has been easy, profiting from rubes who have given Dogecoin a market cap of $20 billion should be a snap. ', 'Griffin has already bested the crypto crowd with his recent $43 million purchase of a first printing of the U.S. Constitution. His most serious rival in the November 2021 Sotheby’s auction was a blockchain-backed digital money collective—a “decentralized autonomous organization” known as ConstitutionDAO, which had raised tens of millions in an attempt to buy the document. ', 'After Griffin secured the prize, he contacted members of the DAO. “We reached out about ideas like shared governance for a period of time, or allowing them to create a [Constitution] NFT for the DAO contributors,” he says. “But they couldn’t make a decision.” Instead, he will lend the document to billionaire Alice Walton’s Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas, to be put on display there. ', '“You need hierarchy, you need leadership structure, you need clear decision making and clear lines of authority,” Griffin says. “The culture of participation trophies is not going to create the leaders we need to run our country in business or politics.” ', '', '', '']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its creator, Vitalik Buterin, has more than 3 million Twitter followers, has made videos with Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis, and has met with Vladimir Putin. All the most popular trends in crypto over the last several years launched on Ethereum: initial coin offerings (ICOs), decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). And it has spawned a whole class of blockchain imitators, often called “Ethereum killers.”', 'Ethereum is also the subject of a great mystery: who committed the largest theft of ether (Ethereum’s native token) ever, by hacking The DAO? The decentralized venture capital fund had raised $139 million in ether (ETH) by the time its crowd sale ended in 2016, making it the most successful crowdfunding effort to that date.\xa0Weeks later, a hacker siphoned 31% of the ETH in The DAO—3.64 million total or about 5% of all ETH then outstanding—out of the main DAO and into what became known as the DarkDAO.', 'Who hacked The DAO? My exclusive investigation, built on the reporting for my new book, The Cryptopians: Idealism, Greed, Lies, and the Making of the First Big Cryptocurrency Craze, appears to point to Toby Hoenisch,\xa0a 36-year-old programmer who grew up in Austria and was living in Singapore at the time of the hack. Until now, he has been best known for his role as a cofounder and CEO of TenX, which raised $80 million in a 2017 initial coin offering to build a crypto debit card—an effort that failed.\xa0The market cap of those tokens, which spiked at $535 million, now sits at just $11 million. ', 'After being sent a document detailing the evidence pointing to him as the hacker, Hoenisch wrote in an email, “Your statement and conclusion is factually inaccurate.”\xa0In that email, Hoenisch offered to provide details refuting our findings—but never answered my repeated follow-up messages to him asking for those details.', 'To put the enormity of this hack in perspective, with ETH now trading around $3,000, 3.64 million ETH would be worth $11 billion. The DAO theft famously and controversially prompted Ethereum to do a hard fork—where the Ethereum network split into two as a way to restore the stolen funds—which ultimately left the DarkDAO holding not ETH, but far less valuable Ethereum Classic (ETC). The proponents of the fork had hoped ETC would die out, but it now trades around $30. That means the descendant wallets of the DarkDAO\xa0now hold more than $100 million in ETC—a high dollar monument to the biggest whodunnit in crypto.', 'Last year, as I was working on my book, my sources and I, utilizing (among other things), a powerful and previously secret forensics tool from crypto tracing firm Chainalysis, came to believe we had figured out who did it. Indeed, the story of The DAO and the six-year quest to identify the hacker, shows a lot about just how far the crypto world and the technology for tracking transactions have both come since the first crypto craze. Today, blockchain technology has gone mainstream. But as new applications arise, one of the first uses of crypto—as an anonymity shield—is in retreat, thanks to both regulatory pressure and the fact that transactions on public blockchains are traceable.', 'Cofounders Toby Hoenisch and Paul Kittiwongsunthorn in Thailand in 2018 during a TenX strategy session. ', 'Since Hoenisch won’t talk to me, I can only speculate about his possible motives; back in 2016 he identified technical vulnerabilities in the DAO early and may have decided to strike after concluding his warnings weren’t being taken seriously enough by the creators of the DAO. (One of his TenX cofounders, Julian Hosp, an Austrian medical doctor who now works in blockchain full time, says of Hoenisch: “He is a person that is super opinionated. Always believed he was right. Always.”) Looked at from that perspective, this is also a tale of the big brains and big egos that drive the crypto world–and of a hacker who may have justified his actions by telling himself he simply did what the faulty code baked into The DAO allowed him to do. ', '• • •', 'In early 2016, the Ethereum network was not even a year old, and there was only one app on it that people were interested in: The DAO, a decentralized venture fund built with a smart contract that gave its token holders the right to vote on proposals submitted for funding. It had been created by a company named Slock.it, which, instead of seeking traditional venture capital, had decided to create this DAO and then open it up for crowdfunding—with the expectation that its own project would be one of those funded by The DAO. Slock.it’s team thought The DAO might attract $5 million.', 'Yet when the crowd sale opened on April 30th, it took in $9 million in just the first two days, with participants exchanging one ether for 100 DAO tokens. As the money poured in, some on the team felt queasy, but it was too late to cap the sale.\xa0By the time the funding closed a month later, 15,000 to 20,000 individuals had contributed, The DAO held what was then 15% of all ether and the price of the cryptocurrency was steadily rising. At the same time, a variety of security and structural concerns were being raised about The DAO, including one that would, ironically, later prove to be crucial to limiting the hacker’s immediate access to the spoils. That problem: withdrawing funds was too hard. Someone wanting to retrieve their money had to first create a “child DAO” or “split DAO,” which required not only a high degree of technical knowledge, but also waiting periods after each step and the agreement of anyone else who moved funds into that child DAO.', 'On the morning of June 17th, ETH reached a new all-time high of $21.52, making the crypto in The DAO worth $249.6 million. When American Griff Green woke up that morning in Mittweida, Germany (he was staying in the family home of two brothers who were Slock.it cofounders), he had a message on his phone from a DAO Slack community member who said something weird was happening— it looked like funds were being drained. Green, Slock.it’s first employee and community organizer, checked: there was indeed a stream of 258-ETH (then $5,600) transactions leaving The DAO. \xa0By the time the attack stopped a few hours later, 31% of the ETH in The DAO had been siphoned out into the DarkDAO. As awareness of the attack spread, ether had its highest trading day ever, with its price plummeting 33% from $21 to $14.', 'Soon, the Ethereum community pinpointed the vulnerability that enabled this theft: the DAO smart contract had been written so that any time someone withdrew money, the smart contract would send the money first, before updating that person’s balance. The attacker had used a malicious smart contract that withdrew money (258 ETH at a time), then interfered with the updating of the contract, allowing them to withdraw the same ether again and again. It was as if the attacker had $101 in their bank account, withdrew $100 at a bank, then kept the bank teller from updating the balance to $1, and again requested and received another $100.', 'Even worse, once the vulnerability became public, the remaining 7.3 million ETH in The DAO was at risk of a copycat attack. A team of white hat hackers (that is, hackers acting ethically)\xa0formed and used the attacker’s method to divert the remaining funds into a new child DAO.\xa0But the attacker still had about 5% of all outstanding ETH, and even the rescued ether was vulnerable, given the flaws in The DAO. Plus, the clock was ticking down to a July 21st deadline—the first date when the original hacker might be able to get at the funds they had diverted into the DarkDao. If the community wanted to keep the attacker from cashing out, they would need to put tokens in the hacker’s DarkDAO and then in any future “split DAOs” (or child DAOs) the unknown hacker created. (Under the rules of the DAO smart contract, the attacker couldn’t withdraw funds if anyone else in their split DAO objected.) Bottom line: if the white hats ever missed their window to object, the attacker would be able to abscond with the funds—meaning this informal group would have to be constantly vigilant.', 'Eventually, after much bickering (on Reddit, on a Slack channel, over email and on Skype calls) and Ethereum founder Buterin publicly weighing in, and after it seemed that a majority of the Ethereum community supported the measure, Ethereum did a “hard fork.” On July 20th the Ethereum blockchain was split into two. All the ETH that had been in the DAO was moved to a “withdraw” contract which gave the original contributors the right to send in their DAO tokens and get back ETH on the new blockchain. The old blockchain, which still attracted some supporters and speculators, carried on as Ethereum Classic. ', '• • •', 'On Ethereum Classic, The DAO and the attacker’s loot (in the form of 3.64 million ETC) remained. That summer, the attacker moved their ETC a few hops away to a new wallet, which remained dormant until late October, when they began trying to use an exchange called ShapeShift to cash the money out to bitcoin. Because ShapeShift didn’t at that time take personally identifying information, the attacker’s identity was not known even though all their blockchain movements were visible. Over the next two months, the hacker managed to obtain 282 bitcoins (then worth $232,000, now more than $11 million). And then, perhaps because ShapeShift frequently blocked their attempted trades, they gave up cashing out, leaving behind 3.4 million Ether Classic (ETC), then worth $3.2 million and now more than $100 million.', 'Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin weighed in supporting the hard fork.', 'That might have been the end of the story—an unknown hacker sitting on a fortune he couldn’t cash out. Except last July, one of my sources involved in the DAO rescue, a Brazilian named Alex Van de Sande (aka Avsa) reached out, saying the Brazilian Police had opened an investigation into the attack on The DAO — and whether he might be a victim or even the hacker himself.\xa0 Van de Sande decided to commission a forensics report from blockchain analytics company Coinfirm to help exonerate himself (though then, the police closed the investigation, he said). In case any similar situations arose in the future, he went forward with the report examining those cash-out attempts in 2016.', 'Among the early suspects\xa0in the hack had been a Swiss businessman and his associates, and in tracing the funds, Van de Sande and I also found another suspect: a Russia-based Ethereum Classic developer. But all these people were in Europe/Russia and the cash-outs mapped onto an Asian-morning-through-evening schedule—from 9 A.M. to midnight Tokyo time—when the Europeans were likely sleeping. (The timing of their social media posts suggested they kept fairly normal hours.)\xa0But based on a customer support email the hacker had submitted to ShapeShift in the leadup to the attack, I believed they spoke fluent English.', 'Jumping off from the Coinfirm analysis, blockchain analytics company Chainalysis saw the presumed attacker had sent 50 BTC to a Wasabi Wallet, a private desktop Bitcoin wallet that aims to anonymize transactions by mixing several together in a so-called CoinJoin. Using a capability that is being disclosed here for the first time, Chainalysis de-mixed the Wasabi transactions and tracked their output to four exchanges. In a final, crucial step, an employee at one of the exchanges confirmed to one of my sources that the funds were swapped for privacy coin Grin and withdrawn to a Grin node called grin.toby.ai. (Due to exchange privacy policies,\xa0normally this sort of customer information would not be disclosed.)', 'The IP address for that node also hosted Bitcoin Lightning nodes: ln.toby.ai, lnd.ln.toby.ai, etc., and was consistent for over a year; it was not a VPN.', 'It was hosted on Amazon Singapore.\xa0Lightning explorer 1ML showed a node at that IP called TenX.', 'For anyone who was into crypto in June 2017, this name may ring a bell. That month, as the ICO craze was reaching its initial peak, there was an $80 million ICO named TenX. The CEO and cofounder used the handle @tobyai on AngelList, Betalist, GitHub, Keybase, LinkedIn, Medium, Pinterest, Reddit, StackOverflow, and Twitter. His name was Toby Hoenisch.', 'Where was he based? In Singapore.', 'Although he was German-born and raised in Austria, Hoenisch is fluent in English.', 'The cash-out transactions occurred mainly from 8 A.M. until 11 P.M. Singapore time.', 'And the email address used on that account at the exchange was [name of exchange]@toby.ai.', 'In May 2016, as it was finishing up its historic fundraise, Hoenisch was intensely interested in The DAO. On May 12, he emailed Hosp a tip (“Profitable crypto trade coming up”) to short ETH once the DAO crowdfunding period ended. On May 17th and 18th, in the DAO Slack channel, he engaged in a long conversation in which he made, depending on how you count, 52 comments, minimum, about vulnerabilities in The DAO, getting into various aspects of the code and nitpicking over exactly what was possible given the way the code was structured.', 'One issue spurred him to email Slock.it’s chief technology officer, Christoph Jentzsch, its lead technical engineer, Lefteris Karapetsas, and community manager Griff Green. In his email, he said he was writing a proposal for funding from The DAO for a crypto card product called DAO.PAY, and added, “For our due diligence, we went through the DAO code and found a few things that are worrisome.” He outlined three possible attack vectors and later emailed with a fourth. Jentzsch, a German who had been working on a PhD in physics before dropping out to focus on Ethereum, responded point by point, conceding some of Hoenisch’s assertions but saying others were “false” or “don’t work.”\xa0The back and forth ended with Hoenisch writing;\xa0“I’ll keep you in the loop if we find anything else.”', 'But instead of further email exchanges, on May 28th, Hoenish wrote four posts on Medium, beginning with, “TheDAO—risk free voting.” The second, “TheDAO—blackmailing withdrawals,” foreshadowed the main issue with The DAO and why Ethereum ultimately chose to hard fork: if it did not, the only other options were to let the attacker cash out his ill-gotten gains or for some group of DAO token holders to follow him forever into new split DAOs he created as he attempted to cash out. “TLDR: If you end upon in a DAO contract without majority voting power, then an attacker can block all withdrawals indefinitely,” he wrote. The third showed how an attacker could do this cheaply.', 'To put the enormity of this hack in perspective, with ETH now trading around $3,000, 3.64 million ETH would be worth $11 billion. ', 'His last, most telling post for the day, “TheDAO—a $150m lesson in decentralized governance,” said DAO.PAY decided against making a proposal after uncovering “major security flaws” and that “Slockit down-played the severity of the attack vectors.” He wrote, “TheDAO is live … and we are still waiting for Slockit to put out a warning that THERE IS NO SAFE WAY TO WITHDRAW!”', 'On June 3, his last Medium post, “Announcing BlockOps: Blockchain Hack Challenges” said, “BlockOps is your playground to break encryption, steal bitcoin, break smart contracts and simply test your security knowledge.” Although he promised to “post new challenges in the field of bitcoin, ethereum and web security every 2 weeks,” I could find no record that he did so.', 'Two weeks later came the DAO attack. The morning after the attack, at 7:18 A.M. Singapore time, Hoenisch trolled Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin by retweeting something Buterin had said before The DAO was attacked, but after it was known that the vulnerability used in the attack was evident in the DAO’s code. In the two-week old tweet, Buterin had said that he’d been buying DAO tokens since the security news. Over the following weeks, Hoenisch tweeted anti-hard fork posts like one titled, “Too Big to Fail is Failure Guaranteed.” ', ""Curiously, on July 5, a couple weeks after the attack, Hoenisch and Karapetsas exchanged Reddit DMs titled “DarkDAO counter attack” — though the substance of the messages is unclear because Hoensich has deleted all his Reddit posts. (Hosp recalls that Hoenisch told him he had deleted his Reddit account after an altercation with an “idiot” on Reddit over The DAO.) Hoenisch wrote, “Sorry for not contacting first. I got carried away from finding it and telling the community that there is a way to fight back. In any case, I don't see any way the attacker can use this.”"", 'After Karapetsas told Hoenisch of the white hats’ plans to protect what was left in The DAO, Hoenisch replied, “I took down the post.” Karapetsas responded, “I will keep you up to date with what we do from now on.” Hoenisch’s last message in that exchange: “I’m sorry if I messed up the plan.”', 'On July 24th, the day after the Ethereum Classic chain revived and began trading on Poloniex, Hoenisch tweeted, “ethereum drama escalating: from #daowars to #chainwars.

Its creator, Vitalik Buterin, has more than 3 million Twitter followers, has made videos with Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis, and has met with Vladimir Putin. All the most popular trends in crypto over the last several years launched on Ethereum: initial coin offerings (ICOs), decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). And it has spawned a whole class of blockchain imitators, often called “Ethereum killers.”', 'Ethereum is also the subject of a great mystery: who committed the largest theft of ether (Ethereum’s native token) ever, by hacking The DAO? The decentralized venture capital fund had raised $139 million in ether (ETH) by the time its crowd sale ended in 2016, making it the most successful crowdfunding effort to that date.\xa0Weeks later, a hacker siphoned 31% of the ETH in The DAO—3.64 million total or about 5% of all ETH then outstanding—out of the main DAO and into what became known as the DarkDAO.', 'Who hacked The DAO? My exclusive investigation, built on the reporting for my new book, The Cryptopians: Idealism, Greed, Lies, and the Making of the First Big Cryptocurrency Craze, appears to point to Toby Hoenisch,\xa0a 36-year-old programmer who grew up in Austria and was living in Singapore at the time of the hack. Until now, he has been best known for his role as a cofounder and CEO of TenX, which raised $80 million in a 2017 initial coin offering to build a crypto debit card—an effort that failed.\xa0The market cap of those tokens, which spiked at $535 million, now sits at just $11 million. ', 'After being sent a document detailing the evidence pointing to him as the hacker, Hoenisch wrote in an email, “Your statement and conclusion is factually inaccurate.”\xa0In that email, Hoenisch offered to provide details refuting our findings—but never answered my repeated follow-up messages to him asking for those details.', 'To put the enormity of this hack in perspective, with ETH now trading around $3,000, 3.64 million ETH would be worth $11 billion. The DAO theft famously and controversially prompted Ethereum to do a hard fork—where the Ethereum network split into two as a way to restore the stolen funds—which ultimately left the DarkDAO holding not ETH, but far less valuable Ethereum Classic (ETC). The proponents of the fork had hoped ETC would die out, but it now trades around $30. That means the descendant wallets of the DarkDAO\xa0now hold more than $100 million in ETC—a high dollar monument to the biggest whodunnit in crypto.', 'Last year, as I was working on my book, my sources and I, utilizing (among other things), a powerful and previously secret forensics tool from crypto tracing firm Chainalysis, came to believe we had figured out who did it. Indeed, the story of The DAO and the six-year quest to identify the hacker, shows a lot about just how far the crypto world and the technology for tracking transactions have both come since the first crypto craze. Today, blockchain technology has gone mainstream. But as new applications arise, one of the first uses of crypto—as an anonymity shield—is in retreat, thanks to both regulatory pressure and the fact that transactions on public blockchains are traceable.', 'Cofounders Toby Hoenisch and Paul Kittiwongsunthorn in Thailand in 2018 during a TenX strategy session. ', 'Since Hoenisch won’t talk to me, I can only speculate about his possible motives; back in 2016 he identified technical vulnerabilities in the DAO early and may have decided to strike after concluding his warnings weren’t being taken seriously enough by the creators of the DAO. (One of his TenX cofounders, Julian Hosp, an Austrian medical doctor who now works in blockchain full time, says of Hoenisch: “He is a person that is super opinionated. Always believed he was right. Always.”) Looked at from that perspective, this is also a tale of the big brains and big egos that drive the crypto world–and of a hacker who may have justified his actions by telling himself he simply did what the faulty code baked into The DAO allowed him to do. ', '• • •', 'In early 2016, the Ethereum network was not even a year old, and there was only one app on it that people were interested in: The DAO, a decentralized venture fund built with a smart contract that gave its token holders the right to vote on proposals submitted for funding. It had been created by a company named Slock.it, which, instead of seeking traditional venture capital, had decided to create this DAO and then open it up for crowdfunding—with the expectation that its own project would be one of those funded by The DAO. Slock.it’s team thought The DAO might attract $5 million.', 'Yet when the crowd sale opened on April 30th, it took in $9 million in just the first two days, with participants exchanging one ether for 100 DAO tokens. As the money poured in, some on the team felt queasy, but it was too late to cap the sale.\xa0By the time the funding closed a month later, 15,000 to 20,000 individuals had contributed, The DAO held what was then 15% of all ether and the price of the cryptocurrency was steadily rising. At the same time, a variety of security and structural concerns were being raised about The DAO, including one that would, ironically, later prove to be crucial to limiting the hacker’s immediate access to the spoils. That problem: withdrawing funds was too hard. Someone wanting to retrieve their money had to first create a “child DAO” or “split DAO,” which required not only a high degree of technical knowledge, but also waiting periods after each step and the agreement of anyone else who moved funds into that child DAO.', 'On the morning of June 17th, ETH reached a new all-time high of $21.52, making the crypto in The DAO worth $249.6 million. When American Griff Green woke up that morning in Mittweida, Germany (he was staying in the family home of two brothers who were Slock.it cofounders), he had a message on his phone from a DAO Slack community member who said something weird was happening— it looked like funds were being drained. Green, Slock.it’s first employee and community organizer, checked: there was indeed a stream of 258-ETH (then $5,600) transactions leaving The DAO. \xa0By the time the attack stopped a few hours later, 31% of the ETH in The DAO had been siphoned out into the DarkDAO. As awareness of the attack spread, ether had its highest trading day ever, with its price plummeting 33% from $21 to $14.', 'Soon, the Ethereum community pinpointed the vulnerability that enabled this theft: the DAO smart contract had been written so that any time someone withdrew money, the smart contract would send the money first, before updating that person’s balance. The attacker had used a malicious smart contract that withdrew money (258 ETH at a time), then interfered with the updating of the contract, allowing them to withdraw the same ether again and again. It was as if the attacker had $101 in their bank account, withdrew $100 at a bank, then kept the bank teller from updating the balance to $1, and again requested and received another $100.', 'Even worse, once the vulnerability became public, the remaining 7.3 million ETH in The DAO was at risk of a copycat attack. A team of white hat hackers (that is, hackers acting ethically)\xa0formed and used the attacker’s method to divert the remaining funds into a new child DAO.\xa0But the attacker still had about 5% of all outstanding ETH, and even the rescued ether was vulnerable, given the flaws in The DAO. Plus, the clock was ticking down to a July 21st deadline—the first date when the original hacker might be able to get at the funds they had diverted into the DarkDao. If the community wanted to keep the attacker from cashing out, they would need to put tokens in the hacker’s DarkDAO and then in any future “split DAOs” (or child DAOs) the unknown hacker created. (Under the rules of the DAO smart contract, the attacker couldn’t withdraw funds if anyone else in their split DAO objected.) Bottom line: if the white hats ever missed their window to object, the attacker would be able to abscond with the funds—meaning this informal group would have to be constantly vigilant.', 'Eventually, after much bickering (on Reddit, on a Slack channel, over email and on Skype calls) and Ethereum founder Buterin publicly weighing in, and after it seemed that a majority of the Ethereum community supported the measure, Ethereum did a “hard fork.” On July 20th the Ethereum blockchain was split into two. All the ETH that had been in the DAO was moved to a “withdraw” contract which gave the original contributors the right to send in their DAO tokens and get back ETH on the new blockchain. The old blockchain, which still attracted some supporters and speculators, carried on as Ethereum Classic. ', '• • •', 'On Ethereum Classic, The DAO and the attacker’s loot (in the form of 3.64 million ETC) remained. That summer, the attacker moved their ETC a few hops away to a new wallet, which remained dormant until late October, when they began trying to use an exchange called ShapeShift to cash the money out to bitcoin. Because ShapeShift didn’t at that time take personally identifying information, the attacker’s identity was not known even though all their blockchain movements were visible. Over the next two months, the hacker managed to obtain 282 bitcoins (then worth $232,000, now more than $11 million). And then, perhaps because ShapeShift frequently blocked their attempted trades, they gave up cashing out, leaving behind 3.4 million Ether Classic (ETC), then worth $3.2 million and now more than $100 million.', 'Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin weighed in supporting the hard fork.', 'That might have been the end of the story—an unknown hacker sitting on a fortune he couldn’t cash out. Except last July, one of my sources involved in the DAO rescue, a Brazilian named Alex Van de Sande (aka Avsa) reached out, saying the Brazilian Police had opened an investigation into the attack on The DAO — and whether he might be a victim or even the hacker himself.\xa0 Van de Sande decided to commission a forensics report from blockchain analytics company Coinfirm to help exonerate himself (though then, the police closed the investigation, he said). In case any similar situations arose in the future, he went forward with the report examining those cash-out attempts in 2016.', 'Among the early suspects\xa0in the hack had been a Swiss businessman and his associates, and in tracing the funds, Van de Sande and I also found another suspect: a Russia-based Ethereum Classic developer. But all these people were in Europe/Russia and the cash-outs mapped onto an Asian-morning-through-evening schedule—from 9 A.M. to midnight Tokyo time—when the Europeans were likely sleeping. (The timing of their social media posts suggested they kept fairly normal hours.)\xa0But based on a customer support email the hacker had submitted to ShapeShift in the leadup to the attack, I believed they spoke fluent English.', 'Jumping off from the Coinfirm analysis, blockchain analytics company Chainalysis saw the presumed attacker had sent 50 BTC to a Wasabi Wallet, a private desktop Bitcoin wallet that aims to anonymize transactions by mixing several together in a so-called CoinJoin. Using a capability that is being disclosed here for the first time, Chainalysis de-mixed the Wasabi transactions and tracked their output to four exchanges. In a final, crucial step, an employee at one of the exchanges confirmed to one of my sources that the funds were swapped for privacy coin Grin and withdrawn to a Grin node called grin.toby.ai. (Due to exchange privacy policies,\xa0normally this sort of customer information would not be disclosed.)', 'The IP address for that node also hosted Bitcoin Lightning nodes: ln.toby.ai, lnd.ln.toby.ai, etc., and was consistent for over a year; it was not a VPN.', 'It was hosted on Amazon Singapore.\xa0Lightning explorer 1ML showed a node at that IP called TenX.', 'For anyone who was into crypto in June 2017, this name may ring a bell. That month, as the ICO craze was reaching its initial peak, there was an $80 million ICO named TenX. The CEO and cofounder used the handle @tobyai on AngelList, Betalist, GitHub, Keybase, LinkedIn, Medium, Pinterest, Reddit, StackOverflow, and Twitter. His name was Toby Hoenisch.', 'Where was he based? In Singapore.', 'Although he was German-born and raised in Austria, Hoenisch is fluent in English.', 'The cash-out transactions occurred mainly from 8 A.M. until 11 P.M. Singapore time.', 'And the email address used on that account at the exchange was [name of exchange]@toby.ai.', 'In May 2016, as it was finishing up its historic fundraise, Hoenisch was intensely interested in The DAO. On May 12, he emailed Hosp a tip (“Profitable crypto trade coming up”) to short ETH once the DAO crowdfunding period ended. On May 17th and 18th, in the DAO Slack channel, he engaged in a long conversation in which he made, depending on how you count, 52 comments, minimum, about vulnerabilities in The DAO, getting into various aspects of the code and nitpicking over exactly what was possible given the way the code was structured.', 'One issue spurred him to email Slock.it’s chief technology officer, Christoph Jentzsch, its lead technical engineer, Lefteris Karapetsas, and community manager Griff Green. In his email, he said he was writing a proposal for funding from The DAO for a crypto card product called DAO.PAY, and added, “For our due diligence, we went through the DAO code and found a few things that are worrisome.” He outlined three possible attack vectors and later emailed with a fourth. Jentzsch, a German who had been working on a PhD in physics before dropping out to focus on Ethereum, responded point by point, conceding some of Hoenisch’s assertions but saying others were “false” or “don’t work.”\xa0The back and forth ended with Hoenisch writing;\xa0“I’ll keep you in the loop if we find anything else.”', 'But instead of further email exchanges, on May 28th, Hoenish wrote four posts on Medium, beginning with, “TheDAO—risk free voting.” The second, “TheDAO—blackmailing withdrawals,” foreshadowed the main issue with The DAO and why Ethereum ultimately chose to hard fork: if it did not, the only other options were to let the attacker cash out his ill-gotten gains or for some group of DAO token holders to follow him forever into new split DAOs he created as he attempted to cash out. “TLDR: If you end upon in a DAO contract without majority voting power, then an attacker can block all withdrawals indefinitely,” he wrote. The third showed how an attacker could do this cheaply.', 'To put the enormity of this hack in perspective, with ETH now trading around $3,000, 3.64 million ETH would be worth $11 billion. ', 'His last, most telling post for the day, “TheDAO—a $150m lesson in decentralized governance,” said DAO.PAY decided against making a proposal after uncovering “major security flaws” and that “Slockit down-played the severity of the attack vectors.” He wrote, “TheDAO is live … and we are still waiting for Slockit to put out a warning that THERE IS NO SAFE WAY TO WITHDRAW!”', 'On June 3, his last Medium post, “Announcing BlockOps: Blockchain Hack Challenges” said, “BlockOps is your playground to break encryption, steal bitcoin, break smart contracts and simply test your security knowledge.” Although he promised to “post new challenges in the field of bitcoin, ethereum and web security every 2 weeks,” I could find no record that he did so.', 'Two weeks later came the DAO attack. The morning after the attack, at 7:18 A.M. Singapore time, Hoenisch trolled Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin by retweeting something Buterin had said before The DAO was attacked, but after it was known that the vulnerability used in the attack was evident in the DAO’s code. In the two-week old tweet, Buterin had said that he’d been buying DAO tokens since the security news. Over the following weeks, Hoenisch tweeted anti-hard fork posts like one titled, “Too Big to Fail is Failure Guaranteed.” ', ""Curiously, on July 5, a couple weeks after the attack, Hoenisch and Karapetsas exchanged Reddit DMs titled “DarkDAO counter attack” — though the substance of the messages is unclear because Hoensich has deleted all his Reddit posts. (Hosp recalls that Hoenisch told him he had deleted his Reddit account after an altercation with an “idiot” on Reddit over The DAO.) Hoenisch wrote, “Sorry for not contacting first. I got carried away from finding it and telling the community that there is a way to fight back. In any case, I don't see any way the attacker can use this.”"", 'After Karapetsas told Hoenisch of the white hats’ plans to protect what was left in The DAO, Hoenisch replied, “I took down the post.” Karapetsas responded, “I will keep you up to date with what we do from now on.” Hoenisch’s last message in that exchange: “I’m sorry if I messed up the plan.”', 'On July 24th, the day after the Ethereum Classic chain revived and began trading on Poloniex, Hoenisch tweeted, “ethereum drama escalating: from #daowars to #chainwars. Ethereum classic now traded on poloniex as $ETC and miners planning attacks.” On July 26th, he retweeted Barry Silbert, the founder and CEO of the powerful and well-respected Digital Currency Group, who had tweeted, “Bought my first non-bitcoin digital currency…Ethereum Classic (ETC).”', '“He (the DAO hacker) really screwed the pooch.

Despite the sector being little more than a decade old, CoinGecko.com reports that there are no fewer than 580 independent crypto exchanges allowing investors to trade virtual currencies. In fact, in the last quarter of 2021, websites of dedicated crypto exchanges received 1.7 billion visits according to SimilarWeb data collected by Forbes.', 'For uninitiated crypto investors, distinguishing quality providers from those that appear to be reputable because of a slick website or famous spokesperson, is nearly impossible. Even exchanges with heavy trading volume in a particular cryptocurrency or pair of cryptos, is a faulty indicator of quality, because in an environment teeming with unregulated providers, it is relatively easy for exchanges to simply report fake numbers. ', 'To help investors navigate the world of buying and selling bitcoin, ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, Forbes Digital Assets analyzed 60 of the largest crypto exchanges ranking them according to ten different criteria (see Ranking Methodology below) ranging from cyber-security provisions and trading fees to institutional backing and regulatory compliance, which we weighted more heavily. At the start of January, the 60 exchanges on our list were generating more than $100 billion in trading volume per day, representing the majority of crypto trading volume globally. ', 'Ten of the exchanges on our list, names like Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken and FTX.US, are most compliant from a regulatory standpoint and thus considered “Class A” according to our survey. Fourteen of the firms we analyzed— companies like PayPal, Robinhood and Block— offer crypto trading, but it isn’t their main business. We dubbed these firms Class B firms. Class C firms are regulated at the national or regional level like Korea’s Coinone, Singapore’s Luno and Mexico’s Bitso. Two larger firms that fall into Class C are FTX and Binance because they are not yet as well regulated as Class A exchanges. Class D exchanges, according to our survey, have websites with legal agreements and registrations in places like the Seychelles and Hong Kong that convey to visitors the sense that these firms are regulated, but business registration is not the same as regulatory compliance. We consider Class D firms like Bitfinex, Kucoin and Gate.io to be largely unregulated. ', 'Unlike traditional financial services, the crypto exchange industry generally lacks standards to certify a new entity before or after they start soliciting client funds. In the United States there is no member organization like FINRA to self-regulate crypto-exchanges despite the fact that from a customer standpoint these exchanges function very similarly to broker-dealers like E-Trade or Schwab. To our knowledge, only Japan has a self-regulating industry group that checks a firm’s basic governance, operational competence, and ensures exchange officials or owners are not individuals with a history of misdeeds or even criminal records. For this reason, our new global ranking puts a heavy weighting on regulatory compliance.', 'One reason that there are more than 600 crypto exchanges has to do with the industry’s low barriers to entry. There are numerous white-label technology firms around the world like Cyprus-based B2Broker, New York City’s Alphapoint, and London’s GCEX that offer aspiring entrepreneurs the software and data needed to get started with a cryptocurrency exchange. Sometimes the cost for such software is no more than $5,000 a month. The administrative part of any new crypto exchange launch – the website, the legal set up, and the financial connections tend to be a minor cost. Sometimes companies need to do little more than register the business in a small island country such as Saint Kitts or Samoa, and hope that they manage to steer clear of regulators like the SEC and the CFTC. ', 'Another potential trap for investors is relying on the “trust scores” or “exchange scores” on popular price and data sites like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko.com. These websites are often compensated for the customers they generate via links to crypto exchanges, so these so-called rankings often involve minimal vetting from a quality and safety standpoint.

Two categories, regulation and popularity, received double-weighting – i.e., a maximum of 6 points each. The regulatory boost is a way to normalize the scale because regulated entities bear additional costs for the sake of being more accountable to the investing public, something that they don’t get sufficient credit for in most cases. Our ‘popularity’ boost is simply an acknowledgement that firms with a certain scale have established a strong track record attracting and onboarding a larger segment of the investing public than their peers.', 'Key Metrics ', 'The ranking process was as quantitatively driven as possible, drawing data from multiple reliable sources. We summarize below key metrics about each firm that our readers may find useful to inform their crypto provider choice.', 'I. Provider Classification ', 'One of the key objectives of our study was to divide crypto exchanges into cohorts to conduct more refined analysis. We ended up splitting the 60 companies into four groups. Class A consists of the most global, regulated, and well capitalized firms, while Class B firms are non-crypto-native financial institutions, Class C are regulated crypto exchanges in particular countries or regions, and class D firms tend to be unregulated or lightly regulated crypto exchanges. ', 'It stands to reason that firms required to meet regulations tend to grow at a slower rate than those that don’t make those kinds of investments. ', 'Before Class A firms list a new token, they have to hire costly experts to assess pros and cons of listing a new asset in the current uncertain regulatory climate. Class A firms also rent office space in expensive financial districts, hire qualified personnel for compliance, retain transaction monitoring software like those of Chainalysis and Elliptic and run up a considerable professional services bill. Their sites have lots of risk disclosures and have prudent marketing. Having no such requirements, Class D firms can allocate more resources at marketing and customer acquisition. That extra share of budget not dedicated to compliance can help Class D firms offer an attractive compensation to a small army of affiliate partners – think of these as independent contractors who can create many web pages and promises of high returns – who drive more traffic to Class D websites. ', 'The lion’s share (41.6%) of all trading volume done in our group of 60 firms is reportedly executed by Binance, a class C exchange. This kind of concentration is unusual but it is reflective of the popularity of crypto derivatives - almost half of all Binance trading volume comes from five such contracts, called perpetual futures. The trading volume of Class D exchanges - approximately 34% of the group’s total - was also high and this was true even after we discounted by 25% all volume from firms domiciled in tax haven locations. From conversations with the CEO of a large crypto data aggregator, our study confirmed that little impedes any crypto exchange from overstating its trading volume to boost their importance at places like CoinMarketCap.com and coingecko.com. To help address the widespread fake volume in the industry, specialist entities like CoinMetrics and others publish reports that illustrate the problem.', 'Another important observation from our classification study is that Class A exchanges published prices for about 215 markets – a market is the name given to trading pairs like bitcoin/tether (BTC/USDT) or ethereum/bitcoin (ETH/BTC) – compared to 299 markets published by Class C exchanges and 487 markets by Class D exchanges. The same is true for the average number of coins offered. This phenomenon may be due to lack of regulatory oversight and rampant marketing of new, unproven assets by Class D exchanges while Class A exchanges tend to consult with attorneys and regulators before (responsibly) listing new assets. Class B firms only operate with one to 20 cryptocurrencies, with few exceptions.', 'Not including Binance, Class C exchanges get only a 7% share of global visits to websites of retail crypto investment providers and they capture a 10% share of estimated trading volume. With Binance, this class gets 47% of all traffic to crypto exchanges and 52% of all volume. Meanwhile, Class B firms have hundreds of millions of clients that may not have entered the crypto market, and this class could be the one that stands to gain handsomely from that introduction when prices start to rise again from the current crypto winter. ', 'Estimating the size of a market that is fast growing and thrives in opacity is more art than science. Forbes estimates that the unduplicated number of unique visitors coming monthly to crypto exchanges (Classes A, C, and D) stood at 100 million as of January 2022, while the total visitors to Class B sites was 208 million. We should note that for our analysis we only counted what we believe are 17 large Class D firms. There are several hundred Class D firms globally – usually very small though one usually can’t tell by looking at a website. In fact, many Class D exchange websites may be out of business but remain up to dupe new investors who don’t know the signs of a zombie crypto exchange.', 'II. Geography of Crypto Providers ', 'Our study was able to ascertain that there are millions of crypto traders in various countries globally, including but not limited to the United States, South Korea, Japan, Russia, Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey, Mexico, India, and Germany. The sixty firms offering crypto investing to retail audiences in our study received a total of 3.92 billion visits during the last quarter of 2021. The location of where the crypto firm registered as its headquarters (or what domicile the firm listed within its Terms of Service document) is what we used to create the tables below and answer questions such as: “What are the geographic areas that crypto exchanges use as base of operations?” and “how significant is the crypto business that originates from firms located in these geographic areas?”', 'The geographic distribution of crypto activity globally showed that about a third of these firms made the United States its home or its main area of business, compared to 38% that made tax haven locations their home. Tax haven-based exchanges captured 34% of visits to crypto service provider sites, and approximately 86% of global trading volume. ', 'It’s worth noting that there can be obfuscation employed by crypto exchanges that are domiciled in a well-known jurisdiction, but it so happens that this locality forbids crypto. Such is the case with Binance, OKX, Bitfinex, and Lbank that list Hong Kong as their domicile in their Terms of Service document. And indeed, they may have business entities registered in Hong Kong, but again registration is not regulation. Hong Kong regulatory licenses – Type 1, 7, and 9 – issued by the Hong Kong SEC are not easy to obtain. Lots happened in mainland China and Hong Kong in 2021, and neither Hong Kong nor the mainland sanction or regulate crypto trading or mining today. This means that if a client of these firms were to take the firm to court in Hong Kong (per the Terms of Use instructions), the answer from the courts could well be that they (the courts) have no jurisdiction or interest in those matters because they don’t sanction crypto investing and don’t regulate those firms.', 'South Korean regulators issued challenging crypto rules that went in effect in 2021 and led to a consolidation from almost 100 exchanges based there to only four with active licenses presently – see below. These regulations required exchanges to pass stringent technology licensing by expert firms in that field and also get one bank sponsorship where the crypto exchange was shown to have suitable methods to track individuals’ identities and tax commitments.', 'Japan’s approach to crypto regulation since the hack of two prominent crypto exchanges in 2018 – Coincheck and Zaif – has been to encourage the creation of a self-regulating entity, which now has 40 members and sets membership criterion on matters such as safety of hot wallets. The following list of crypto providers in Japan is set to grow as more of these providers are added. ', 'Various European regulators have passed rules governing crypto as a virtual currency service which focuses on anti-money laundering (AML) provisions, following the adoption of the 5th AML Directive on January 2020 which required crypto exchanges and custodian wallet providers to be licensed or registered by every single national authority in the European Union. ', 'Germany’s Bafin is seeking public comment on its intention to ban futures contracts that leave investors owing more money than what they invested initially. Considering that much of crypto trading volume occurs in perpetual futures, which in theory can leave investors on the hook for losses beyond what they initially invested, Forbes reached out to Bafin to clarify its position whether these types of contracts would likely be banned. Bafin clarified that both the crypto exchange provider and crypto contract have to go through tests to determine whether they are exempt from these proposed regulations and need to comply with them. ', 'The U.S. crypto regulatory scene is evolving, with regulators taking on different and sometimes overlapping responsibilities.', '', '', 'The SEC plans to regulate digital assets will considerably increase the cost to remain a U.S.-regulated firm operating under money transmitter entity (MTE) licenses. Some of them will choose to exit the U.S. market, and consolidation will start to take place. Firms that are already accustomed to regulation, such as SEC-regulated broker dealers, will hold an edge over the small and midsize crypto exchanges.

The following list of crypto providers in Japan is set to grow as more of these providers are added.

Considering that much of crypto trading volume occurs in perpetual futures, which in theory can leave investors on the hook for losses beyond what they initially invested, Forbes reached out to Bafin to clarify its position whether these types of contracts would likely be banned. Bafin clarified that both the crypto exchange provider and crypto contract have to go through tests to determine whether they are exempt from these proposed regulations and need to comply with them.

Some of them will choose to exit the U.S. market, and consolidation will start to take place.

This configuration is broad but may well make sense to the way a Tunisian software programmer or a Lille based manual worker views French politics.', 'The important question now is what Emmanuel Macron and the French state will do about this growing divide in the next five years. The likelihood of a disparate, divided parliament and the competing interests of voters on the left and right will make domestic policy very difficult, and Macron might well concentrate his efforts on foreign policy.', 'The challenge, in my Irish eyes, will be to make French politics more democratic (the EIU rates France as a ‘flawed democracy’ along with the USA for instance) and manifestly more grass roots oriented.

My job is to help you find it!” Rule #5 of Bob Farrell’s famous 10 Rules for Investing states: “The Public Buys the Most at the Top and the Least at the Bottom.” His Rule #9 says: “When All the Experts Agree, Something Else is Going to Happen.”', 'Bond Market Decline in Perspective', 'There is no doubt about it – bonds are the most hated asset class on Wall Street. That’s why all the above axioms apply. Bonds are in a 50-year bear market as seen from the downdraft in bond prices in the chart above. Prior to that sell-off, Wall Street had been pointing to the paltry yields bonds were returning to their holders. TINA (There Is No Alternative) was the resulting acronym. We wonder, after the recent run-up in bond yields, if we will be hearing about a new acronym: TIA! ', 'The questions that need to be answered about bonds are: 1) Why such a rapid and deep bond sell-off; and 2) What’s the likelihood that it can go further?', 'As we’ve chronicled in this blog since the Fed’s March meeting when the bond sell-off began in earnest, the bond market has compressed the Fed’s contemplated set of rate hikes over an 18-month period (the “dot-plot”) into a matter of weeks, in effect, immediately tightening financial conditions to that terminal 18-month view. Never mind that the “dot-plot” has a paltry 37% correlation with the resulting reality (because the Fed is “data dependent,” it can change its intentions as the incoming data dictate).', 'In past Fed tightening cycles, “forward guidance” as the dot-plots are now called, did not exist (forward guidance began in 2012). In prior tightening cycles, no one knew what the Fed was going to do until they did it. Since the recent Fed meeting, as inflation has escalated, so has the hawkish rhetoric from Fed governors. That, too, never occurred in past tightening cycles. And, with each of those hawkish utterances, bonds yields have ratcheted higher (prices lower). It isn’t any wonder that everyone hates bonds!', 'Of course it can go further. We don’t know tomorrow’s or next week’s prices or yields. But we do know some economics that tell us that over the next several months, the economy will slow and inflation will moderate. When this occurs bond yield will fall and the Fed, being “data dependent” will have moderated its hawkishness. ', 'Currently, the Fed has insisted that it will engineer a “soft landing” for the economy. We note that its track record on this score is not poor, it is miserable. And, this time, it has embarked on its tightening campaign at a point in the business cycle where, in the past, it has typically halted tightening actions. We also note that the Fed can’t cure the cause of the current inflation (supply side issues). The only thing it tools can do is suppress demand. ', 'We do believe that much of the hawkish rhetoric coming out of the Fed is posturing (for their credibility), as the public is quite upset over the rapid rise in prices and is looking to government for a cure. (Unfortunately, the government is partly to blame – but that is the subject of another blog.) The tools that the Fed has to “cure” the inflation (reduced demand and likely recession) won’t be much liked either.', 'Remember, markets have already priced-in the end state of an extremely hawkish Fed. For bond prices to deteriorate from their current levels would take incoming data showing rapidly rising economic growth and inflation accelerating to even greater heights, neither of which are indicated as we chronicle below. Because the Fed says their future actions are “data dependent,” if the incoming data show sluggishness and inflation begins to wane, the Fed will not carry out the hawkish plan already priced into the markets. And, if that happens, markets will re-price to the new, less hawkish, scenario. That would mean rising bond prices and falling yields. ', 'The rest of this blog discusses our outlook for moderating inflation and slowing economic growth outlooks.', '', '', 'WTI Cushing Crude oil Spot Px Index', '', '', 'Commodity Percentage Change', '', '', 'The incoming data says inflation has peaked. This notion doesn’t yet appear to be in the market for bond prices which still appear to be marching to the tune of the hawkish Fed drummer. A lower inflation number for April, due out the second week of May, is likely to have a positive impact on bond prices (lower yields) barring any additional unforeseen economic shocks. ', '', '', 'US Real Average Weekly Earnings', 'Household View of Finances: ""Much"" or ""Somewhat"" Better Off', '', '', 'Fiscal policy contributions to quarterly gross domestic product growth', '', '', '', '', 'China PMI', '', '', ""Most of China's major cities have imposed some Covid restrictions"", 'When both Europe and China are in recession, and with emerging data so sluggish in the U.S., it appears that a worldwide recession is all but assured.', 'We haven’t even mentioned Quantitative Tightening (QT) in this blog. Just as a reminder, the last time the Fed removed liquidity via QT in 2018, it was at half the pace it has currently indicated it would do beginning in May. Remember how the equity markets swooned (and Powell pivoted)? Currently, equity markets are well off their peaks. And we worry about market reaction once QT begins. In a flat or falling equity market, consumers, now wary about their financial well-being, lower spending and save more.', 'Putting it all together, we have markets pricing-in the Fed’s end of tightening cycle rates at the beginning of that very tightening cycle. It appears to us that we have a Fed that has increased their hawkish posturing as the Y/Y inflation data has deteriorated (i.e. political posturing).', 'On the economic front, the data shows that we are late in the business cycle. This Fed has been way behind the curve. Usually, at this point in the cycle, they have been tightening for some time, and as the economy weakens, they start to scale back the tightening, or even ease. The incoming data looks weak as inflation has taken its toll on incomes and is in the process of doing so on consumption. ', 'The good news is that it looks like March will have been inflation’s peak (lower gasoline prices and base effects). Perhaps that will reduce the Fed’s hawkishness. If it doesn’t, then a rising unemployment rate surely will. We do expect a 50-basis point rate hike at the Fed’s May meeting, but that is already baked into bond market pricing. We also think the Fed will let the equity markets go lower (i.e., no Fed “Put”). As noted earlier, a falling equity market plays poorly with consumer psyches, especially among the middle class. ', 'If we have read the tea leaves correctly, as the economic scene unfolds, the economy will weaken, inflation will begin to moderate, the Fed will become less hawkish, and, in an era of “forward guidance,” the markets will reprice bonds to lower yields (higher prices). While equity investors are not likely to have a great or even good year (QT), it appears that fixed-income investors will.

My job is to help you find it!” Rule #5 of Bob Farrell’s famous 10 Rules for Investing states: “The Public Buys the Most at the Top and the Least at the Bottom.” His Rule #9 says: “When All the Experts Agree, Something Else is Going to Happen.”', 'Bond Market Decline in Perspective', 'There is no doubt about it – bonds are the most hated asset class on Wall Street. That’s why all the above axioms apply. Bonds are in a 50-year bear market as seen from the downdraft in bond prices in the chart above. Prior to that sell-off, Wall Street had been pointing to the paltry yields bonds were returning to their holders. TINA (There Is No Alternative) was the resulting acronym. We wonder, after the recent run-up in bond yields, if we will be hearing about a new acronym: TIA! ', 'The questions that need to be answered about bonds are: 1) Why such a rapid and deep bond sell-off; and 2) What’s the likelihood that it can go further?', 'As we’ve chronicled in this blog since the Fed’s March meeting when the bond sell-off began in earnest, the bond market has compressed the Fed’s contemplated set of rate hikes over an 18-month period (the “dot-plot”) into a matter of weeks, in effect, immediately tightening financial conditions to that terminal 18-month view. Never mind that the “dot-plot” has a paltry 37% correlation with the resulting reality (because the Fed is “data dependent,” it can change its intentions as the incoming data dictate).', 'In past Fed tightening cycles, “forward guidance” as the dot-plots are now called, did not exist (forward guidance began in 2012). In prior tightening cycles, no one knew what the Fed was going to do until they did it. Since the recent Fed meeting, as inflation has escalated, so has the hawkish rhetoric from Fed governors. That, too, never occurred in past tightening cycles. And, with each of those hawkish utterances, bonds yields have ratcheted higher (prices lower). It isn’t any wonder that everyone hates bonds!', 'Of course it can go further. We don’t know tomorrow’s or next week’s prices or yields. But we do know some economics that tell us that over the next several months, the economy will slow and inflation will moderate. When this occurs bond yield will fall and the Fed, being “data dependent” will have moderated its hawkishness. ', 'Currently, the Fed has insisted that it will engineer a “soft landing” for the economy. We note that its track record on this score is not poor, it is miserable. And, this time, it has embarked on its tightening campaign at a point in the business cycle where, in the past, it has typically halted tightening actions. We also note that the Fed can’t cure the cause of the current inflation (supply side issues). The only thing it tools can do is suppress demand. ', 'We do believe that much of the hawkish rhetoric coming out of the Fed is posturing (for their credibility), as the public is quite upset over the rapid rise in prices and is looking to government for a cure. (Unfortunately, the government is partly to blame – but that is the subject of another blog.) The tools that the Fed has to “cure” the inflation (reduced demand and likely recession) won’t be much liked either.', 'Remember, markets have already priced-in the end state of an extremely hawkish Fed. For bond prices to deteriorate from their current levels would take incoming data showing rapidly rising economic growth and inflation accelerating to even greater heights, neither of which are indicated as we chronicle below. Because the Fed says their future actions are “data dependent,” if the incoming data show sluggishness and inflation begins to wane, the Fed will not carry out the hawkish plan already priced into the markets. And, if that happens, markets will re-price to the new, less hawkish, scenario. That would mean rising bond prices and falling yields. ', 'The rest of this blog discusses our outlook for moderating inflation and slowing economic growth outlooks.', '', '', 'WTI Cushing Crude oil Spot Px Index', '', '', 'Commodity Percentage Change', '', '', 'The incoming data says inflation has peaked. This notion doesn’t yet appear to be in the market for bond prices which still appear to be marching to the tune of the hawkish Fed drummer. A lower inflation number for April, due out the second week of May, is likely to have a positive impact on bond prices (lower yields) barring any additional unforeseen economic shocks. ', '', '', 'US Real Average Weekly Earnings', 'Household View of Finances: ""Much"" or ""Somewhat"" Better Off', '', '', 'Fiscal policy contributions to quarterly gross domestic product growth', '', '', '', '', 'China PMI', '', '', ""Most of China's major cities have imposed some Covid restrictions"", 'When both Europe and China are in recession, and with emerging data so sluggish in the U.S., it appears that a worldwide recession is all but assured.', 'We haven’t even mentioned Quantitative Tightening (QT) in this blog. Just as a reminder, the last time the Fed removed liquidity via QT in 2018, it was at half the pace it has currently indicated it would do beginning in May. Remember how the equity markets swooned (and Powell pivoted)? Currently, equity markets are well off their peaks. And we worry about market reaction once QT begins. In a flat or falling equity market, consumers, now wary about their financial well-being, lower spending and save more.', 'Putting it all together, we have markets pricing-in the Fed’s end of tightening cycle rates at the beginning of that very tightening cycle. It appears to us that we have a Fed that has increased their hawkish posturing as the Y/Y inflation data has deteriorated (i.e. political posturing).', 'On the economic front, the data shows that we are late in the business cycle. This Fed has been way behind the curve. Usually, at this point in the cycle, they have been tightening for some time, and as the economy weakens, they start to scale back the tightening, or even ease. The incoming data looks weak as inflation has taken its toll on incomes and is in the process of doing so on consumption. ', 'The good news is that it looks like March will have been inflation’s peak (lower gasoline prices and base effects). Perhaps that will reduce the Fed’s hawkishness. If it doesn’t, then a rising unemployment rate surely will. We do expect a 50-basis point rate hike at the Fed’s May meeting, but that is already baked into bond market pricing. We also think the Fed will let the equity markets go lower (i.e., no Fed “Put”). As noted earlier, a falling equity market plays poorly with consumer psyches, especially among the middle class. ', 'If we have read the tea leaves correctly, as the economic scene unfolds, the economy will weaken, inflation will begin to moderate, the Fed will become less hawkish, and, in an era of “forward guidance,” the markets will reprice bonds to lower yields (higher prices). While equity investors are not likely to have a great or even good year (QT), it appears that fixed-income investors will.

As I wrote on April 1, even Summers conceded that long-term inflationary expectations remain low.', 'As Summers told the Times, “right now people are forecasting way accelerated inflation for this year. The market forecast is close to 6% [with the $25 to $30 a barrel oil price increase contributing 1% to 1.5% to that rate] but they’re still forecasting more limited inflation beyond.” ', 'I think there is merit in trying to keep long-term inflationary expectations from getting as high as they were back in 1981.

If the labor market remains tight, consumers have money coming in and are willing and able to pay higher prices. So producers keep raising prices - thus keeping inflation high and boosting workers’ expectations for bigger raises.', 'The only tool the Fed has to keep this WPS from raising long-term inflationary expectations is to raise short-term interest rates way above long-term rates. That creates a so-called inverted yield curve which is often a good predictor of recessions.', 'How good of a predictor depends on which data you choose. According to Barron’s, in the first week of April, the yield curve inverted slightly with the two-year treasury yield at 2.42% — 20 basis points more than the 10-year yield of 2.40%.', 'Such a gap has been a good predictor of recessions. A BCA Research report “found that the gap between 2- and 10-year yields has inverted before seven of the past eight recessions, with no false signals. The gap between 3-month and 10-year yields has a better record, calling all 8 recessions without a false signal,” wrote Barron’s.', 'Summers told the Globe that the Fed will have to raise rates considerably to cause a recession.

With the 30-year fixed mortgage reaching 5% for the first time in the last 11 years, he sees the “housing market could be the canary in the coal mine for whether higher rates lead to a soft or hard landing for the economy.”', 'I see one of two outcomes: inflation will eventually tame itself over the next couple of years as supply catches up with demand, or the Fed will raise interest rates enough that a recession will rein in inflation. ', 'Every investor is different. However, if you have a decade before you need to withdraw your funds, I think it makes sense to keep making monthly contributions into a stock index fund. Over the long run, stocks generate a return of about 7%.', 'If I had known in November 2021 what I know now, I probably would have sold a considerable amount of my technology stock holdings at the beginning of that month. But let’s get real — I do not know (nor does anyone else) when a market top or a market bottom is reached.', 'If there is any reason why buying now is good, it could be that there is so much bad news out there and in theory it is now reflected in stock prices. But I doubt the market reflects, say, the effects of Russia launching nuclear missiles at major Western population centers.', 'Meanwhile, if history is any guide, if Summers is right and a recession is heading our way, the recession will not last more than 18 months and the stock market will surpass its previous high once the recession ends. In recessions since 1980, it has taken the S&P 500 anywhere between seven and 76 months to surpass the pre-recession high. ', 'How so? According to the balance, below are the six recessions since 1980, how long they lasted, and my estimate of how long it took for the S&P 500 to surpass its previous high after it fell during that recession:', '', '', 'So unless the recession that Summers predicts is more severe than the previous six, patient investing in a stock index fund will likely work out for you.', '']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a transaction that typically requires lots of paperwork, people, and legal checkpoints to happen, it didn’t seem possible.', ""Thanks to blockchain and a burgeoning world of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), this wave of possibility is already within view. It's like we're sitting on the shore, we see the wave coming, and we're grabbing our boards to surf it."", 'You see, the couple-click, faster, simpler, more secure transfer of real estate assets that everyone who is tied to the transaction - the buyer, seller, and agent - has yearned for over a decade, is now accessible to everyone through Web3 technologies. ', 'What happened on Wednesday, April 13th, 2022, in Tampa, Florida - the couple-click experience, has made that dream a reality. ', 'Until now, the conversation around Web3 innovation has been dominated by the art world and seen as a way of proving and securing ownership of digital assets. ', 'Reid Hoffman (founder of LinkedIn and venture capital firm Greylock) stated in a recent podcast that web2 was for real identities and relationships, and now web3 is the upgrade of the web for ownership. Because obviously, “once you have a cryptographically secure ledger, it isn’t just digital assets that could be there”.', 'Ownership is something that exists not in objective reality, but as a result of human interaction. It exists because humans agree that it exists. Some examples of social constructs are countries, money, and private property. Car ownership is just a title, it’s a record in a database, thus it’s a digital asset. Thus it could be governed via blockchain. ', 'What about real estate? Here I am, sitting in my new home in Miami and going through the process of buying a new home for my in-laws, and experiencing the same thing so many buyers are - making one blind offer after another on multiple properties, and now 8-months later, having lost weeks of our lives in this process, a more transparent, smoother and faster process can’t come soon enough. ', 'Imagine this better future: You find the house you want, you either connect your wallet or your online banking in one place, and with a couple of clicks you participate in an online, transparent auction. If you need a loan, you apply and get approved within the auction process, instantly. ', 'So what happened in Tampa', 'My team reported: “We are ready, the smart contract is deployed, the NFT is minted, and the sale can start”. I said, “Ok, let’s do it”. ', 'This is how a 24-hour sale started and how the world would observe the offers coming in. ', 'This sale was the world’s 3d NFT sale of a home. In my previous article, I explained how the first real property NFT was born. This recent sale was different because it also accepted USDC instead of Ether - our response to our Propy Twitter community vote. ', 'The buyer who made the highest offer had been at the open house but at the time of the sale was traveling in Texas. On April 13th, they became owners via Web3 settlement.', 'Once the sale was concluded the buyer called and asked: “What’s next?”. When my team shared this with me over zoom, I smiled. It was hard for people to believe that at that moment, as it occurred after the last two NFT sales, the buyers became owners immediately. They had all the documents in advance for due diligence. All that was left was to receive the code for the smart lock to receive the key.', 'No hassle. Totally secure. Lightning-fast.', 'Here’s the link to this transaction on Etherscan (it’s a browser for blockchain records). ', 'This home sale is now immutably recorded on a public blockchain. While Ethereum is supported, no one can change or delete this proof and the NFT can further change hands. And of course, it can be done on any decentralized blockchain. ', 'While there’s been over $4 billion of real estate transactions recorded on blockchain, for the first time in history, this instant settlement on blockchain has been achieved for a small number of assets for now.', 'Just like streaming on Netflix \n \nNFLX\n has scaled, and buying goods online has scaled, it can scale for real estate - a couple of clicks on the front end connected to smart contracts and a person owns a home. The ownership is legally de-attached from county recording and now lives on-chain.', 'This future is already here', 'In 2021 12% of first homebuyers tapped into their crypto funds to secure down payments. This means a new generation of buyers are willing to invest in using a different method of payment and transactional experience to buy real estate. The ramifications of this are breathtakingly endless. Instead of the $1.7 trillion turnover, we’ll likely see, the real estate market could potentially increase to a $3 - 5 trillion market. Moving from state to state for jobs, family or opportunity is already part of the culture for young people, as well as owning crypto. Why not buy instead of renting homes when moving, and own a property in their wallet within minutes?', 'What people can now envision, is that Web3 (which includes NFTs, smart contracts, and blockchain) is primed to completely transform how homes are bought and sold. They enable the process to be handled completely online, making transactions more efficient, automated, and with fewer middlemen. The entire sale is handled on a secure platform, creating transparency for all parties.', 'Another great advantage of web3 is that the “fake it till you make it” concept is close to impossible - you either have a record of transactions on immutable on-chain or you don’t.', ""You might think that this innovation will not scale because of the mortgage problem as traditional lenders don’t accept crypto holders' earnings statements. Well, key players in the new finance world are actively developing novel products to provide mortgages for homebuyers secured by crypto portfolios, common among the new generation of homebuyers. And a number of defi protocols are also looking to expand to provide down payment loans and mortgages for crypto holders, such as XBTO, Milo, Helio."", 'One can also envision a new global marketplace for buying and selling homes, not unlike OpenSea NFT marketplace today. It could be OpenSea, but buying real estate requires each wallet (it’s almost like your login), that you are “login-ing in” and buying assets with, to be identified, but the current NFT marketplaces intentionally are built for anonymous users. Thus use cases that need identities attached to wallets will require new products to evolve. A showcase of homes ready to be transacted on immediately, all anchored in a solid legal framework governing the secure transfer of real property rights.', 'We are not talking about fractional ownership. The concept was already there with crowdfunding platforms and REITs, and now will drastically improve with new companies like SolidBlock, LoftyAI, RealT, Acrew, and will make it more appealing for the crypto community. Rather it’s a full ownership transfer of homes via blockchain, easily just like we buy books on Amazon.', 'Ultimately, the foundation of Web3 exists as a combination of blockchain, smart contracts, decentralized currency and lending, and ownership of data and assets. All of these technologies will work together to provide the products and services consumers are – and will – demand. ', 'Today, we’re seeing crypto token standards like ERC721 used as a representation of real property ownership in the real world and virtual property in the metaverse. Blockchain and smart contracts are being used to help manage transactions, offer, title, and more. Consumers now trust blockchain technology, they trust smart contracts rather than small tech startups. Consumers understood that no government or corporation can take over their data or an asset if it’s in their crypto wallet. And that’s why more use cases such as real estate will yet evolve and turn into the next big things.', ""While NFT art and music sales are cooling down, - lower volume on OpenSea, and a symbolic Jack Dorsey’s first tweet now can't sell for the same price, the innovation will stay, artists and creators will earn more from now on. Capital flow, sparked by art NFT popularity, accelerated the search for new applications for this technology in other industries, including bringing it into reality in the field of real estate. "", 'What will be the next big culturally relevant movement that leads to the evolution of known economic and financial systems, is yet to be discovered.', '']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

', 'What happened on Wednesday, April 13th, 2022, in Tampa, Florida - the couple-click experience, has made that dream a reality. ', 'Until now, the conversation around Web3 innovation has been dominated by the art world and seen as a way of proving and securing ownership of digital assets. ', 'Reid Hoffman (founder of LinkedIn and venture capital firm Greylock) stated in a recent podcast that web2 was for real identities and relationships, and now web3 is the upgrade of the web for ownership. Because obviously, “once you have a cryptographically secure ledger, it isn’t just digital assets that could be there”.', 'Ownership is something that exists not in objective reality, but as a result of human interaction. It exists because humans agree that it exists. Some examples of social constructs are countries, money, and private property. Car ownership is just a title, it’s a record in a database, thus it’s a digital asset. Thus it could be governed via blockchain. ', 'What about real estate? Here I am, sitting in my new home in Miami and going through the process of buying a new home for my in-laws, and experiencing the same thing so many buyers are - making one blind offer after another on multiple properties, and now 8-months later, having lost weeks of our lives in this process, a more transparent, smoother and faster process can’t come soon enough. ', 'Imagine this better future: You find the house you want, you either connect your wallet or your online banking in one place, and with a couple of clicks you participate in an online, transparent auction. If you need a loan, you apply and get approved within the auction process, instantly. ', 'So what happened in Tampa', 'My team reported: “We are ready, the smart contract is deployed, the NFT is minted, and the sale can start”. I said, “Ok, let’s do it”. ', 'This is how a 24-hour sale started and how the world would observe the offers coming in. ', 'This sale was the world’s 3d NFT sale of a home. In my previous article, I explained how the first real property NFT was born. This recent sale was different because it also accepted USDC instead of Ether - our response to our Propy Twitter community vote. ', 'The buyer who made the highest offer had been at the open house but at the time of the sale was traveling in Texas. On April 13th, they became owners via Web3 settlement.', 'Once the sale was concluded the buyer called and asked: “What’s next?”. When my team shared this with me over zoom, I smiled. It was hard for people to believe that at that moment, as it occurred after the last two NFT sales, the buyers became owners immediately. They had all the documents in advance for due diligence. All that was left was to receive the code for the smart lock to receive the key.', 'No hassle. Totally secure. Lightning-fast.', 'Here’s the link to this transaction on Etherscan (it’s a browser for blockchain records). ', 'This home sale is now immutably recorded on a public blockchain. While Ethereum is supported, no one can change or delete this proof and the NFT can further change hands. And of course, it can be done on any decentralized blockchain. ', 'While there’s been over $4 billion of real estate transactions recorded on blockchain, for the first time in history, this instant settlement on blockchain has been achieved for a small number of assets for now.', 'Just like streaming on Netflix \n \nNFLX\n has scaled, and buying goods online has scaled, it can scale for real estate - a couple of clicks on the front end connected to smart contracts and a person owns a home. The ownership is legally de-attached from county recording and now lives on-chain.', 'This future is already here', 'In 2021 12% of first homebuyers tapped into their crypto funds to secure down payments. This means a new generation of buyers are willing to invest in using a different method of payment and transactional experience to buy real estate. The ramifications of this are breathtakingly endless. Instead of the $1.7 trillion turnover, we’ll likely see, the real estate market could potentially increase to a $3 - 5 trillion market. Moving from state to state for jobs, family or opportunity is already part of the culture for young people, as well as owning crypto. Why not buy instead of renting homes when moving, and own a property in their wallet within minutes?', 'What people can now envision, is that Web3 (which includes NFTs, smart contracts, and blockchain) is primed to completely transform how homes are bought and sold. They enable the process to be handled completely online, making transactions more efficient, automated, and with fewer middlemen. The entire sale is handled on a secure platform, creating transparency for all parties.', 'Another great advantage of web3 is that the “fake it till you make it” concept is close to impossible - you either have a record of transactions on immutable on-chain or you don’t.', ""You might think that this innovation will not scale because of the mortgage problem as traditional lenders don’t accept crypto holders' earnings statements. Well, key players in the new finance world are actively developing novel products to provide mortgages for homebuyers secured by crypto portfolios, common among the new generation of homebuyers. And a number of defi protocols are also looking to expand to provide down payment loans and mortgages for crypto holders, such as XBTO, Milo, Helio."", 'One can also envision a new global marketplace for buying and selling homes, not unlike OpenSea NFT marketplace today. It could be OpenSea, but buying real estate requires each wallet (it’s almost like your login), that you are “login-ing in” and buying assets with, to be identified, but the current NFT marketplaces intentionally are built for anonymous users. Thus use cases that need identities attached to wallets will require new products to evolve. A showcase of homes ready to be transacted on immediately, all anchored in a solid legal framework governing the secure transfer of real property rights.', 'We are not talking about fractional ownership. The concept was already there with crowdfunding platforms and REITs, and now will drastically improve with new companies like SolidBlock, LoftyAI, RealT, Acrew, and will make it more appealing for the crypto community. Rather it’s a full ownership transfer of homes via blockchain, easily just like we buy books on Amazon.', 'Ultimately, the foundation of Web3 exists as a combination of blockchain, smart contracts, decentralized currency and lending, and ownership of data and assets. All of these technologies will work together to provide the products and services consumers are – and will – demand. ', 'Today, we’re seeing crypto token standards like ERC721 used as a representation of real property ownership in the real world and virtual property in the metaverse. Blockchain and smart contracts are being used to help manage transactions, offer, title, and more. Consumers now trust blockchain technology, they trust smart contracts rather than small tech startups. Consumers understood that no government or corporation can take over their data or an asset if it’s in their crypto wallet. And that’s why more use cases such as real estate will yet evolve and turn into the next big things.', ""While NFT art and music sales are cooling down, - lower volume on OpenSea, and a symbolic Jack Dorsey’s first tweet now can't sell for the same price, the innovation will stay, artists and creators will earn more from now on. Capital flow, sparked by art NFT popularity, accelerated the search for new applications for this technology in other industries, including bringing it into reality in the field of real estate. "", 'What will be the next big culturally relevant movement that leads to the evolution of known economic and financial systems, is yet to be discovered.', '']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And anyone can file for an automatic extension that will give you until October 17—just be sure to estimate your tax liability and pay any amount due by the April 18 filing deadline to avoid penalties and interest.', 'Grab the special charitable contribution tax break. For folks who take the standard deduction—that’s nine out of 10 taxpayers—there’s a special tax break for making cash gifts to charity for 2021. Ordinarily, taxpayers can take a charitable donation deduction only if they itemize deductions. But under this special law, individuals who don’t itemize can deduct up to $300 and a married couple filing jointly can deduct up to $600 for charitable donations made by cash, check or credit card. The deduction lowers both adjusted gross income and taxable income – translating into tax savings for those making donations to qualifying tax-exempt organizations. So scan your 2021 credit card statements. If you made monthly donations to the ASPCA, for example, or if you made a one-time donation in memory of a loved one who passed away, those donations count—up to the $300/$600 limit.', 'Max out retirement and healthcare saving accounts. How does saving money get you a bigger refund? Contributions to pre-tax accounts reduce your taxable income. You can contribute to an Individual Retirement Account and/or a Health Savings Account and the contribution counts for the prior tax year up until tax day. Individuals can contribute up to $6,000 to an IRA—plus an additional $1,000 if you’re 50 or older—for the 2021 tax year. the contribution limits for HSAs, available if you had a high-deductible health insurance plan, are $3,600 for individual coverage and $7,200 for family coverage, plus $1,000 extra if you’re 55 or older. For lower-income taxpayers, another incentive to save for retirement is the $1,000 Saver’s Credit. A credit reduces taxes dollar for dollar, making it more valuable than a deduction.', 'Got kids? Check out the enhanced child and dependent care credit. If you paid a day care center or other “qualifying” care provider to watch your kids—under age 13—so you and/or your spouse could work, you may be eligible to claim an enhanced child and dependent care credit. This is different than the Advanced Child Tax Credit that was doled out in monthly payments in the second half of the year to most families with kids—and is trued up on your 2021 tax return. This is also different than the dependent care flexible spending account benefit you might have through work—if you have one of these accounts, use that up first, then apply any extra child care costs to claim the credit.', 'For 2021, Congress sweetened the child and dependent care credit: a maximum credit of $4,000 for one child receiving care, and $8,000 for two or more. Taxpayers with adjusted gross income up to $125,000 are eligible for the full credit, which decreases until it phases out at $438,000 of adjusted gross income. The 2021 changes also made the credit refundable, which means that even if you don’t owe any tax, the credit will be paid to you as a refund. The National Taxpayer Advocate has more details on the changes to this important tax credit for families. Note it applies not only to kids, but also to paid care for other dependents such as elderly parents.', 'More taxpayers qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit. Congress made permanent changes—and temporary changes for 2021—to the EITC, which helps low- to moderate-income taxpayers. An example of a permanent change: The maximum amount of investment income like interest and dividends that a taxpayer can earn and still be eligible for the credit was increased from $3,650 to $10,000. A temporary change for 2021: More taxpayers are eligible, including those over 65 without children and taxpayers as young as 19. And you can use your 2019 income to qualify if it results in a larger tax credit. The National Taxpayer Advocate has tips on how to avoid errors when claiming the EITC and what to do in the case of an EITC audit.

But under this special law, individuals who don’t itemize can deduct up to $300 and a married couple filing jointly can deduct up to $600 for charitable donations made by cash, check or credit card. The deduction lowers both adjusted gross income and taxable income – translating into tax savings for those making donations to qualifying tax-exempt organizations. So scan your 2021 credit card statements. If you made monthly donations to the ASPCA, for example, or if you made a one-time donation in memory of a loved one who passed away, those donations count—up to the $300/$600 limit.', 'Max out retirement and healthcare saving accounts. How does saving money get you a bigger refund? Contributions to pre-tax accounts reduce your taxable income. You can contribute to an Individual Retirement Account and/or a Health Savings Account and the contribution counts for the prior tax year up until tax day. Individuals can contribute up to $6,000 to an IRA—plus an additional $1,000 if you’re 50 or older—for the 2021 tax year. the contribution limits for HSAs, available if you had a high-deductible health insurance plan, are $3,600 for individual coverage and $7,200 for family coverage, plus $1,000 extra if you’re 55 or older. For lower-income taxpayers, another incentive to save for retirement is the $1,000 Saver’s Credit. A credit reduces taxes dollar for dollar, making it more valuable than a deduction.', 'Got kids? Check out the enhanced child and dependent care credit. If you paid a day care center or other “qualifying” care provider to watch your kids—under age 13—so you and/or your spouse could work, you may be eligible to claim an enhanced child and dependent care credit. This is different than the Advanced Child Tax Credit that was doled out in monthly payments in the second half of the year to most families with kids—and is trued up on your 2021 tax return. This is also different than the dependent care flexible spending account benefit you might have through work—if you have one of these accounts, use that up first, then apply any extra child care costs to claim the credit.', 'For 2021, Congress sweetened the child and dependent care credit: a maximum credit of $4,000 for one child receiving care, and $8,000 for two or more. Taxpayers with adjusted gross income up to $125,000 are eligible for the full credit, which decreases until it phases out at $438,000 of adjusted gross income. The 2021 changes also made the credit refundable, which means that even if you don’t owe any tax, the credit will be paid to you as a refund. The National Taxpayer Advocate has more details on the changes to this important tax credit for families. Note it applies not only to kids, but also to paid care for other dependents such as elderly parents.', 'More taxpayers qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit. Congress made permanent changes—and temporary changes for 2021—to the EITC, which helps low- to moderate-income taxpayers. An example of a permanent change: The maximum amount of investment income like interest and dividends that a taxpayer can earn and still be eligible for the credit was increased from $3,650 to $10,000. A temporary change for 2021: More taxpayers are eligible, including those over 65 without children and taxpayers as young as 19. And you can use your 2019 income to qualify if it results in a larger tax credit. The National Taxpayer Advocate has tips on how to avoid errors when claiming the EITC and what to do in the case of an EITC audit.

Then I’ll provide some illustrations based on my company’s software, maxifi.com, to point out that definitely yes could, depending on your situation, be definitely no.', 'This year Congress will likely pass The Secure Act 2.0 (formally, Securing a Strong Retirement Act of 2022), which, like The Secure Act of 2019, enacted under President Trump, will raise the age at which you need to take distributions from regular (taxable) IRAs and from your employer 401(k), 403(b), and similar accounts. The only exception involves retirement accounts of employers with whom you are still working.', 'Before the passage of the Secure Act, RMDs (Required Minimum Distributions) began at age 70 1/2. The Secure Act raised that to age 72. The Secure Act 2.0 (at least the House version) would raise the age to 73 this year, to 74 in 2029, and to 75 in 2033. The Secure Act 2.0, which has other important provisions, looks headed for passage. Democratic and Republican House members of Congress won’t be caught riding an elevator together, but they’ve passed the Secure Act 2.0 by a vote of 415-5. And, although the Senate has its own spin on the bill, its version also includes an increase in the RMD starting age — to 75 by 2032.', 'Deferring cashing out your IRA has two advantages. First, you can earn income tax-free inside your account. This is called inside build up. Second, you can wait to make IRA withdrawals until your tax bracket is relatively low. Inside build-up isn’t what it used to be given interest rates are so low. As I write, the return on 1-year Treasury bills is a measly 1.7 percent. Worse, there’s no way to safely get even a real (after inflation) return apart from buying things you’d otherwise be buying in the future and simply storing them. If you invest in 1-year T bills, inflation may continue at its current 8.5 percent annual pace. If so, your real (after-inflation) return will be negative 6.8 percent! That’s a nasty hit. But it could be far worse if inflation is lots higher. Yes, you can invest in the market, but on a risk-adjusted basis (and the stock market is currently particularly risky), this is no different from investing in 1-year Treasuries. Or you can invest in 1-year TIPS (Treasury Inflation Protected Securities) and lock in your real loss at the prevailing negative 3.24 percent real yield. But even this supposed safe way to lose money isn’t for sure. If inflation were, for example, 20 percent, you’d have to pay extra taxes on the 20 percent inflation kicker. If you’re in the 30 percent bracket, this would mean an additional 6 percent real loss due to the extra taxes.', 'It’s one thing to know that by deferring withdrawals you are saving taxes while earning a decent or at least zero real return. It’s another thing to know that to garner the measly deferral advantage you have to invest at significant risk. In short, gambling on an unsure, but almost assuredly bad real return to repay in the future what you can pay for sure now makes little sense.', 'The other argument for waiting to withdraw — doing so at a lower tax rate — only makes sense if you’ll actually be in a lower tax bracket. That’s not an easy calc especially given the non-linear and non-indexed manner in which Social Security benefits are taxed and Medicare Part B premiums are levied. Clearly, compressing most of your taxable IRA withdrawals late in life might land you in higher brackets than if you start withdrawals early. Moreover, most households are too cash constrained to wait till, say, 75 to start drawing on their taxable retirement accounts.', 'Given these concerns, why are essentially all members of Congress hell-bent on raising the RMD starting age? My guess is they believe it will help them personally. If this seems overly cynical, I wish you had been with me in 2017 when a US senator was asking me to help him make the case for special provisions in the Tax Cut and Jobs Act. I hadn’t known him, originally formed a good impression after a serious of initial meetings and phone calls, but increasingly realized he was focused on amending the pending law in a way that would help his own company. We quickly parted ways never to talk again. But the senator held out to the last minute to ensure he got the tax break he personally wanted based on what I felt were completely bogus arguments. In short, when you see Congress bearing tax gifts, it’s likely delivering the gifts to themselves.', 'As for what you should do, the answer is there is no general answer. Let me illustrate this point using MaxiFi.com. Take a hypothetical, age-60, single retiree named Dan who made close to $115,000 when he retired last year. Dan lives in DC and plans to take Social Security at 70 and start smooth IRA withdrawals at 72. He’s investing in short-term T-bills. Dan’s assuming inflation will quickly moderate, leaving him with an annual negative .5 percent return.', 'Dan has $3 million in his IRA and $100K in the bank. That’s a terrific nest egg compared to most retirees, but Dan’s plan entails extremely tough sledding for the next decade. His real, post-tax, annual spending budget on everything, including housing, is less than $9K a year. At 70, when Social Security kicks in, it jumps to almost $42K. And from 72 on, it jumps to $97K.', 'Clearly, waiting till 75 to start withdrawals, whether RMDs or more, would exacerbate Dan’s cash constraint. But would it save him taxes? To check, I ran the program’s robo-optimization that searchers for the Social Security and IRA withdrawal-start-date strategies that jointly maximize users’ lifetime spending. The tool found Dan an extra $221K! That massive amount represents roughly 2.5 years of Dan’s after-tax earnings in the final years of his career.', 'So, what’s the magic trick? It’s not taking Social Security earlier. Dan’s plan — to take Social Security at 70 — when his retirement benefit starts at its maximum value — is dead on. No, his extra spending capacity is due to reducing taxes, but not entirely. The tax reduction — federal and DC is $136K. The rest, $85K, comes from Dan’s lowering his Medicare Part B premium payments. The Medicare Part B premium is essentially another highly progressive tax Uncle Sam has quietly added to his long list of fiscal programs. As you reduce the number of years during which you take taxable retirement account withdrawals, you raise your modified adjusted gross income in those years. And this can land you in much higher Part B premium brackets.', 'What if Dan were still working with 65 as his retirement age as well as his Social Security benefit start date. Now Dan’s optimal age for beginning smooth IRA withdrawals is 66, not 60. Indeed, waiting till 66 raises his lifetime spending by $19K. And if Dan works through 65, but waits till 70 to take Social Security, his optimal age for starting IRA withdrawals changes yet again — to age 64 from age 66. These moves produce a $200K increase in lifetime spending coming primarily from higher lifetime Social Security benefits.', 'In optimizing his lifetime spending, Dan reaps another huge bonus. Whether he retires at 60 and immediately takes withdrawals or retires at 65 and starts withdrawals at 64, Dan’s cash-flow problem essentially disappears. For example, if Dan retires at 65, smoothly withdrawals from his IRA starting at 65, and takes Social Security at 70, he gets to spend $88K annually through age 70 and $89K thereafter.', 'The bottom line? Don’t be taken in by what Congress suggests is best. Each of us has an optimal retirement account withdrawal strategy that is highly sensitive to our particular circumstances as well as our retirement as well as other decisions. For some households, taking RMDs and only RMDs may be optimal until very late in life. This would likely be the case if, for example, Dan had a very young spouse with little in the way of earnings or assets. For others, like the Dan portrayed here, taking withdrawals quite early — far earlier than any Wall Street firm would advise (I wonder why.) — is, in fact, optimal.', '', '']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

287,forbes,https://www.forbes.com/fdc/contact.html,,,"['President Joe Biden (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)', 'A new bombshell announcement from the White House: President Joe Biden will cancel student loans or extend the student loan pause for a fifth time before August 31, 2022.', 'Here’s what you need to know — and what it means for your student loans.', 'Days after extending the student loan payment pause for the fourth time, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that Biden is gearing up potentially to extend the student loan pause again or enact wide-scale student loan cancellation. On a new episode of the podcast Pod Save America, Psaki said, “So between now and August 31, [the student loan pause is] either going to be extended or we’re going to make a decision, as [White House Chief of Staff] Ron [Klain] referenced, about canceling student debt.”', 'Psaki’s announcement is not a repeat of Klain’s comments from an earlier podcast episode of Pod Save America. Rather, Klain’s comments were different from what Psaki described. Last month, Klain said, “The president is going to look at what we should do on student debt before the pause expires, or he’ll extend the pause.” First, Klain said this before Biden extended the student loan payment pause through August 31. Klain referred to deciding before the student loan payment pause expired on May 1. Second, Klain never referenced any extension of the student loan payment pause beyond August 31. Third, Klain never explicitly referenced wide-scale student loan cancellation. (Here’s who won’t qualify for $6.2 billion of student loan cancellation). Rather, Klain said, “the president is going to look at what we should do.” This is a general statement about student loans, which could include targeted student loan cancellation, fixing public service loan forgiveness or improving student loan repayment. (Student loan cancellation and the student loan payment pause are confusing. Here’s what to know).', 'This is a potential game-changer for student loans. Now, Psaki is saying that at a minimum, the student loan payment pause could be extended beyond August 31. (Biden could extend the student loan payment pause forever). At a maximum, Biden could cancel student loans. That is a significant development and different than what the Biden administration has said previously. Yes, there has been speculation that Biden would extend the student loan payment pause at least beyond the midterm election on November 8, 2022. Why? Progressive Democrats in Congress have been pressuring Biden to extend student loan relief and cancel student loans. They fear that without more student loan relief, Democrats will lose control of Congress in the upcoming election. (If student loans don’t get canceled, borrowers threaten to vote against Democrats). However, the Biden administration previously never explicitly confirmed this game plan. Psaki had confirmed previously that Biden still considering wide-scale student loan forgiveness. ', 'Will your student loans get canceled? Interestingly, if you parse her words, Psaki said that Biden will either extend the student loan payment pause or cancel student loans. That statement implies that either option is possible, but not both. If this is true, this may raise more questions. For example, what type of student loan cancellation? Is this targeted student loan cancellation? Wide-scale student loan cancellation? How much student loan forgiveness? Will everyone qualify for student loan cancellation, or will it be focused on low-income student loan borrowers only? (Biden dropped student loan cancellation from budget). Psaki also said during the podcast that Biden still prefers Congress to enact $10,000 of wide-scale student loan cancellation. (Student loan cancellation could look different than you expect). Why? If Biden attempts to enact wide-scale student loan cancellation, it could lead to legal challenges in court, which could delay implementation. Alternatively, a future Republican president could issue an executive order to halt any student loan cancellation. (Student loan relief: how to qualify for a “fresh start” on your student loans).', 'Despite this latest development, there is no guarantee that Biden will pause student loans for the fifth time or enact wide-scale student loan cancellation. For now, student loan payments restart beginning September 1, 2022. Are you prepared? Here are some of the best ways to take control of your financial life and pay off student loans:', '', '', '']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

292,forbes,https://www.forbes.com/ir/,,,"['President Joe Biden (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)', 'A new bombshell announcement from the White House: President Joe Biden will cancel student loans or extend the student loan pause for a fifth time before August 31, 2022.', 'Here’s what you need to know — and what it means for your student loans.', 'Days after extending the student loan payment pause for the fourth time, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that Biden is gearing up potentially to extend the student loan pause again or enact wide-scale student loan cancellation. On a new episode of the podcast Pod Save America, Psaki said, “So between now and August 31, [the student loan pause is] either going to be extended or we’re going to make a decision, as [White House Chief of Staff] Ron [Klain] referenced, about canceling student debt.”', 'Psaki’s announcement is not a repeat of Klain’s comments from an earlier podcast episode of Pod Save America. Rather, Klain’s comments were different from what Psaki described. Last month, Klain said, “The president is going to look at what we should do on student debt before the pause expires, or he’ll extend the pause.” First, Klain said this before Biden extended the student loan payment pause through August 31. Klain referred to deciding before the student loan payment pause expired on May 1. Second, Klain never referenced any extension of the student loan payment pause beyond August 31. Third, Klain never explicitly referenced wide-scale student loan cancellation. (Here’s who won’t qualify for $6.2 billion of student loan cancellation). Rather, Klain said, “the president is going to look at what we should do.” This is a general statement about student loans, which could include targeted student loan cancellation, fixing public service loan forgiveness or improving student loan repayment. (Student loan cancellation and the student loan payment pause are confusing. Here’s what to know).', 'This is a potential game-changer for student loans. Now, Psaki is saying that at a minimum, the student loan payment pause could be extended beyond August 31. (Biden could extend the student loan payment pause forever). At a maximum, Biden could cancel student loans. That is a significant development and different than what the Biden administration has said previously. Yes, there has been speculation that Biden would extend the student loan payment pause at least beyond the midterm election on November 8, 2022. Why? Progressive Democrats in Congress have been pressuring Biden to extend student loan relief and cancel student loans. They fear that without more student loan relief, Democrats will lose control of Congress in the upcoming election. (If student loans don’t get canceled, borrowers threaten to vote against Democrats). However, the Biden administration previously never explicitly confirmed this game plan. Psaki had confirmed previously that Biden still considering wide-scale student loan forgiveness. ', 'Will your student loans get canceled? Interestingly, if you parse her words, Psaki said that Biden will either extend the student loan payment pause or cancel student loans. That statement implies that either option is possible, but not both. If this is true, this may raise more questions. For example, what type of student loan cancellation? Is this targeted student loan cancellation? Wide-scale student loan cancellation? How much student loan forgiveness? Will everyone qualify for student loan cancellation, or will it be focused on low-income student loan borrowers only? (Biden dropped student loan cancellation from budget). Psaki also said during the podcast that Biden still prefers Congress to enact $10,000 of wide-scale student loan cancellation. (Student loan cancellation could look different than you expect). Why? If Biden attempts to enact wide-scale student loan cancellation, it could lead to legal challenges in court, which could delay implementation. Alternatively, a future Republican president could issue an executive order to halt any student loan cancellation. (Student loan relief: how to qualify for a “fresh start” on your student loans).', 'Despite this latest development, there is no guarantee that Biden will pause student loans for the fifth time or enact wide-scale student loan cancellation. For now, student loan payments restart beginning September 1, 2022. Are you prepared? Here are some of the best ways to take control of your financial life and pay off student loans:', '', '', '']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pooley/Getty Images)', 'Behind the sunny spin about the U.S. economy’s low unemployment rates, many older Americans are battling some grim realities. Take 67-year-old Tina Caston, who worked more than 20 years as an operations officer in the U.S. Navy and was ready for a comfortable retirement. Then, when her savings didn’t keep pace with rising costs of living, Caston had to take a new job as a substitute teacher—a job she now expects to work until she’s 72.', 'As Caston told NewsNation recently, “I thought I was doing all the right things — saving and taking care of family members. I never thought that at this point I would be retired and have to find another job.” ', 'Caston is nowhere near alone—and inflation, the buzzword of the moment, is not the main cause pushing so many older workers back into the labor force. The sad (and fixable) reality, as I explained to NewsNation, is that America’s older workers are losing bargaining power, being pushed out of work before they are financially ready, and often pushed back into work to make ends meet. ', 'Despite Indeed’s Nick Bunker’s perky interpretation on Twitter (shared by many)—that increased flows of older people back into jobs as the pandemic wanes means that people who retired voluntarily are now gladly returning to work—the data suggest a more grim reality. ', 'So-called “retirements” during the pandemic were very different from those in the past. The nation has more than 1 million older Americans aged 55-74 who call themselves “retired” than we would have normally expected if there wasn’t a recession. ', 'Evidence suggests that most of these people did not retire voluntarily. The overused phrase ""Great Resignation"" doesn’t apply to these older workers—the Great Pushout, causing massive increases in elderly unemployment and involuntary retirement, is more like it.', 'A team of economists at The New School found that older workers were likely pushed out of the labor force in 2020 and 2021 before they were financially ready to stop working, as in past recessions; essentially they “retired” reluctantly after being unemployed. In pre-pandemic times, more elder workers transitioned from work to retirement without being pushed back into work. It was, at least for some, the “gold watch and buffet lunch” kind of retirement that, decades ago, was more of a norm in America. (Though it’s worth noting, even before the pandemic, most retirements were not voluntary because most people retire earlier than planned.) In this pandemic, especially for older workers without college degrees, it was a “jobless then give up” kind of retirement. ', 'The hidden force of massive unemployment hitting older workers without college degrees during the pandemic has thus changed the meaning of the benign phrase uttered to the government worker collecting data: for these less fortunate older workers, “I’m retired,” most likely means, “I was forced out before I wanted to leave employment.” ', 'What is the evidence that older workers were pushed out instead of sauntering out to retirement? ', 'There is a wealth of evidence showing that America’s older workers are in fact being pushed out before they are ready.', '1. Older workers did not “retire” en masse when the pandemic started. Of the 35 million older workers who were employed in March 2020, 750,000 workers (2.1%) retired that April—which is what we would expect since 2% of older workers in 2019 also went from a job to retirement. ', 'Instead, older workers lost their jobs en masse: 3.8 million workers aged 55-74 (a whopping 10.7% of all employed workers in this age group) became unemployed in April 2020. That is more than 20 times as many unemployed as in a pre-pandemic month. And in a trend we’ve documented previously, older workers experienced higher unemployment than prime-aged workers (ages 25-54). ', '2. This unemployment shock affected older workers’ retirement decisions. Out of the 3.8 million older workers who lost their job in April 2020, 400,000 retired a year later; before the pandemic, only 30,000 older workers went from unemployment to retirement. ', '3. In further evidence that older workers did not retire by choice, more people retired from employment in 2019 than during the pandemic—2.6 million compared to 2.4 million. During the pandemic, older workers held on to their jobs and those who were able to keep their jobs postponed retirement. . This fact contradicts the “Great Resignation” narrative that workers, particularly older workers, resigned and retired by choice. The massive job losses during the pandemic contributed to the current retirement surge; these so-called retirees did not resign and leave voluntarily.', '4. Yet more evidence shows older workers have lost bargaining power—wage growth for older workers is relatively low compared to young and mid-career workers. This further suggests that elder workers are, unfortunately, not in a solid financial position to retire comfortably.', 'Will older workers who were pushed out of the labor force return to work? ', 'Many are asking—will these elderly folks unretire? The answer depends on the demand for older workers. If employers want older workers, they will find older workers, who may find themselves in a weaker bargaining position than before they were pushed out. What we have here is a supply problem –these “retirees” likely want (or often need) to work because earlier-than-planned retirement drastically hurts older people’s financial readiness.', 'Here’s the bottom line: While Tina Caston and many others are being pressed back into work out of sheer financial need, overall we do not see the same large numbers of retirees who were pushed out now returning to the labor force. To be clear, this is likely due to a tight labor market and older folks’ decreased bargaining power—not because they are comfortably retired. ', 'If employers were reaching out to older workers–and there is NO evidence they are—we would be seeing much higher “unretirement rates.” At the current pace, it would take almost two years to employ the 1.7 million excess “retirements” that accumulated because of the pandemic. Some older workers are returning, but these flows do not match the mass of pandemic retirements. Having an unretirement rate equal to what it was pre-pandemic is not enough to employ all those elders who now find themselves in need of work again. ', 'Will retirees come back to work with bargaining power?', 'Given older workers’ desperate need to work to accumulate retirement funds and recover from massive cutbacks in hours and unemployment benefits, it is likely that they will not have the bargaining power to raise wages and improve working conditions significantly. To boost older worker bargaining power, the nation must enforce age discrimination laws; lower the Medicare age and make it the first payer of health insurance; and help older workers organize unions. ', 'Unionizing warehousing work and home and personal care work—both occupations where conditions and pay are low and disproportionately hire older workers—would be a good place to start.', 'As these trends continue, rather than chirp about older workers’ return to the workplace, we’ll need clear-eyed, data-driven assessments that consider these elders’ realities: for most, they were pushed out of work prematurely before they were financially ready to retire, and, like Caston, are now under financial pressure to work deeper into old age just to survive.', 'New School Economics PhD student, Barbara Schuster, did much of the research for this blog and wrote the first draft. Chris Cook helped with the editing and framing. NewsNation found the amazing Tina Caston.

If employers want older workers, they will find older workers, who may find themselves in a weaker bargaining position than before they were pushed out. What we have here is a supply problem –these “retirees” likely want (or often need) to work because earlier-than-planned retirement drastically hurts older people’s financial readiness.', 'Here’s the bottom line: While Tina Caston and many others are being pressed back into work out of sheer financial need, overall we do not see the same large numbers of retirees who were pushed out now returning to the labor force. To be clear, this is likely due to a tight labor market and older folks’ decreased bargaining power—not because they are comfortably retired. ', 'If employers were reaching out to older workers–and there is NO evidence they are—we would be seeing much higher “unretirement rates.” At the current pace, it would take almost two years to employ the 1.7 million excess “retirements” that accumulated because of the pandemic. Some older workers are returning, but these flows do not match the mass of pandemic retirements. Having an unretirement rate equal to what it was pre-pandemic is not enough to employ all those elders who now find themselves in need of work again. ', 'Will retirees come back to work with bargaining power?', 'Given older workers’ desperate need to work to accumulate retirement funds and recover from massive cutbacks in hours and unemployment benefits, it is likely that they will not have the bargaining power to raise wages and improve working conditions significantly. To boost older worker bargaining power, the nation must enforce age discrimination laws; lower the Medicare age and make it the first payer of health insurance; and help older workers organize unions. ', 'Unionizing warehousing work and home and personal care work—both occupations where conditions and pay are low and disproportionately hire older workers—would be a good place to start.', 'As these trends continue, rather than chirp about older workers’ return to the workplace, we’ll need clear-eyed, data-driven assessments that consider these elders’ realities: for most, they were pushed out of work prematurely before they were financially ready to retire, and, like Caston, are now under financial pressure to work deeper into old age just to survive.', 'New School Economics PhD student, Barbara Schuster, did much of the research for this blog and wrote the first draft. Chris Cook helped with the editing and framing. NewsNation found the amazing Tina Caston.
