# Web Scarping in Python

One of the most important skills of a data analyst, as far as my understanding goes, is the ability to collect data. It is the first step in the analyzing phase which every data anlyst walks through.
Collecting data from different data sources and organizeing it in logical data structures can be a difficult task. In many cases, finding a data source is a relatively easy task - but extracting it is a different story. In this project I am gathering data related to the stock market, based on sources like Yahoo's Financial API and the use of python packages to scrape news websites like Forbs.
