# Portfolio
 
I am Yoav Weller,  an undergraduate studying psychology and management in Ben Gurion University of the Negev and a junior data analyst.
The main goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate my analytical skills - both tangible skills (such as programming skills in R and Python) and intangible skills (such as my approach to solving challenges and problems).
